"ABC absolutely on point with their Alien advertI like how it goes out of its way to give cleavage to Sigourney Weaver. Reminds me of how her character lamented being packaged in *Galaxy Quest*.[deleted]You saw tiny panties, I saw no bra. Apples and oranges.They could have used that image with the tag line Alien: It'll get you in the endI don't know man.  That chest bone is sticking out further than her breasts.Doesn't really pertain but yes we all remember the tiny panties.And yet there were critics who called Sigourney Weaver androgynous-looking. Seriously...They didn't watch this interview then: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0e2Y9P6R6w"
"If she's androgynous, Hillary Swank is man.Well, have you ever seen Hilary Swank and Matt Damon in the same shot?I...well...no, no I haven't."
"Confirmed Hillary Swank is Matt Damon.She is. That doesn't mean she isn't sexy.High five. Confidence is sexy. Plus, she looked really hot in some of her more Cougar-y roles in later years (and, you know, where they actually used any make up)."

"wtf that's straight up Reese Witherspoon doppelganger.She was also pretty hot in Ghostbusters*Hnnnnnngggghhh*those look like regular panties to me."
"They seemed to fit so badly. I mean, not their size as in _coverage_, but their size in somebody tortures this fabricclearly you have not seen them from the back, then.not in the late 70s they weren'tits the future durrWay to misunderstand the sentiment there palHelp me out here, pls. That scene is laser-etched into my deep memory. Watching it is one of my first sexually formative experiences. Even now, the warm tingly feelings that I felt in my stomach so many years ago are almost palpable. I cannot not think of that scene as pure sex, added into the film for my benefit. >I cannot not think of that scene as pure sex, added into the film for my benefit."
">lolzfeminism"
"HehThat comment just made my skin crawl. yeesh.It ruined sex for me. Every time I see a girl in panties, I check the room for Aliens.You don't get it do you? YOU ARE THE ALIEN!Could be worse; you could have seen Teeth instead.So, you're saying that you've never checked the room.Alien. No panties in Aliens. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsGUQdb1bYwBoxers don't count as panties."

"to some strange phallic worldaway to another phallaxy I'm so confused about the sentiment of *this* comment.[deleted]Well, I think having her in skimpy underwear is what makes the scene sexy. If they had stuck with the original plan of her being naked, the scene would've been much less sexy, and much more terrifying."
"A great comparison would be the fight scene in Eastern Promises if Viggo Mortensen was wearing tight boxers. suddenly it's just a regular fight with a kick-ass, sexy protagonist.[deleted]I've read that they initially planned for her to do that whole sequence totally nude. And she was on board with it."

It was the 70's, so lots of bush.That would definitely be in line with H.R. Giger's work too. And the fact that the entire concept of Alien is based on rape.Wow never heard about that, could you expand??> One thing that people are all disturbed about is sex... I said 'That's how I'm going to attack the audience; I'm going to attack them sexually. And I'm not going to go after the women in the audience, I'm going to attack the men. I am going to put in every image I can think of to make the men in the audience cross their legs. Homosexual oral rape, birth. The thing lays its eggs down your throat, the whole number.'"
"- Alien screenwriter Dan O'Bannon"
"Lots more in this article: http://www.cracked.com/article_18932_alien-film-franchise-based-entirely-rape.htmlI think that's a reference to the guy getting face raped in the beginning of the movie, and the shipboard alien being the baby of that attack.Or, just, you know, the general theme regarding how it attacks you violently and then causes you to host and birth another life you never wanted. well everyone says rape because it makes it sound edgier."
"It is based around parasite life cycle."
"plenty of species capture prey and make them immobile and let their species eat away inside a creature while it is alive."
"For people who insist it is rape. This is for you!"
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitoid_wasp"
"It is actually a natural occurring form of life.  But lets pretend it is all about rape because it involves humans and sounds cooler."
"Alien grabs person incapacitates them and drags them back to the nest ( wasp stings bug drags it back to the nest).  Alien then cocoons them so they cant run away (Wasp paralyzes bug so it can run away). Egg layed by nearby queen then infects host with baby alien (Wasp lays egg inside or on bug which then infects bug).  Baby alien feeds and grows larger eventually bursting from and killing the host (Ditto for wasp larvae)."
"Both the alien and wasp feature a larvae form while they are inside the organism as well."
"Every generation of the Xenomorph life cycle except the humanoid one looks like genitals.And your comment shows why babies are basically parasites. Thanks Cheryl A creature that forces its seed down your throat, then its offspring forces its way out of your chest cavity and then said offspring proceeds to violently murder with a extra pair of thrusting teeth from its mouth and the final scene of the movie is a half naked woman facing the monster alone. I mean, it's definitely not subtle.mmmm."
"so you are saying when a wasp thrusts its hard stinger into an insect. it is totally sexual."
"ok then.Is the wasp then laying eggs? Because they do do that.No one is saying that at all because that's a horrible comparison. That's something that happens in nature, we're talking about a film here. The manner in which the xenomorphs reproduce and kill is an allegory for rape.It's not an interpretation, the screenwriters have directly said as much."
"> One thing that people are all disturbed about is sex... I said 'That's how I'm going to attack the audience; I'm going to attack them sexually.

"> [Ronald] Shusett said, I have an idea: the monster screws one of them, planting its egg in his body, and then bursting out of his chest. Both realized the idea had never been done before, and it subsequently became the core of the film.[3] This is a movie about alien interspecies rape, O'Bannon said in the documentary Alien Evolution. That's scary because it hits all of our buttons.[4] O'Bannon felt that the symbolism of homosexual oral rape was an effective means of discomforting male viewers."

"Why do you think they picked Giger in the first place?  His imagery is very sexual in nature."
"None of this is accidental.the problem being is what they are calling rape wasnt rape."
"It was a perfectly natural form of life that inspired them.  Calling it rape makes it edgier and more artistic.  It was a shock value word they decided to use.  It's simple."
"I say this as one of the biggest alien franchise fans out there. > It was a perfectly natural form of life that inspired them."
"Not according to what the screenwriters themselves have said.  They have said it is about rape.  If you have a different source that explains their inspirations differently, I would love to read it.  Otherwise you're just stating your own opinion as fact."
"The fact that there are naturally occurring examples of parasitic impregnation in no way demonstrates the film is not intentionally about rape."
"It is about rape.  The screenwriters have said so plainly.  The movie itself is awash in sexual imagery (do you think [the openings to the alien ship resembling vaginas](https://blog.openstreetmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/b66a5-alien-movie-spacesuits1.jpg) is an accident?? They're not even being subtle about it).  Ripley being virtually naked and vulnerable at the end is entirely intentional and fully aligned with this overall theme.Face huggers literally mouth rape their victims. I mean.. literally.The alien is very phallic. It penetrates its prey with a thrusting mouth. The facehugger forces itself onto a host and impregnates it and the xenomorph is born through another violent penetration. When Ash attacks Ripley, he tries to choke her by shoving a nudie magazine down her throat, a very ridiculous way to try and kill someone. When Lambert is attacked, the alien hooks his tail around her as if to pop a feel. When Ripley finds herself locked in the escape ship with the xenomorph, she in a state of undress to show her vulnerability."
"Ridley Scott is a great director and, like all great directors, every shot, prop, and line was tailored specifically for a reason. Also the general shape of the drone alien's head looks like a dick. The face hugger's mouth looks like a grisly minge.>The alien is very phallic"
"I covered that =PWow, who fucked ***that*** up for us??MPAA probably.No exposed nipple or pubic hair shots! Chest burstings? Okay!If that was the case I'm suprised because back then they had tits in pretty much every movieBoobs are mostly okay, pubic hair apparently really is not.Also add to the fact that they never at any point had a gun, her character's picture in that ad is just a bunch of stuff the movie didn't focus on.Can we talk about the lack of a comma also?"
"> When you've got nothing to lose there's nothing you won't try."
"versus"
"> When you've got nothing to lose, there's nothing you won't try.For some reason I recall John Hurt and Tom Skerrit having a short conversation about 'bringing the weapons' or something, before they set out on foot to the derelict spacecraft. I don't however, remember the gun actually being shown on screen.  I could just be losing my marbles, but I'm pretty sure of this.I love how they have Cain over on the side pushing buttons like he was an important character lol. Can anyone think of any other non historical action film where there isn't a gun? It's incredible really."
"Edit: apparently there is one gun, but it is never used. Kane has a pistol and moves to draw it just before [spoilers](the facehugger jumps on him). A speargun is not a gun.I was wondering about the gun, too.Interesting fact that not a lot of people know, there were actually laser gun props made for and used in the film. You can see them briefly strapped to the legs of the crewmembers space suits when they go to check out the Derilect. They also popped up in some promotional images for the film. However, the guns were obviously never used during the actual film, mostly edited around on screen, and completely drummed out of Canon in regards to franchise lore.Very much a trait of shitty B sci-fi movies that have covers with next to nothing on it that is actually in the movie."
"Just put some guns and boobs on it Jerry no one caresMaybe we should thank them for changing our expectations. It gives the movie much more impact.that's the first thing i though, then i wasn't sure if she did have a gun at some point, so i didn't want to post it"
"LOL"
"Yes they did. John Hurt held a gun before his face got kissed by the facehugger.None of them had guns. It was a commercial ship. No one on the ship is even military (except Brett might be a vet, but definitely not active duty).It almost seems like a parody...almostI could see it being code for sci-fi action of the time. If you throw a sexy lady and a space gun on their people are going to take a chance on a movie that broke all kinds of genre rules. It might be kind of deceitful, but I would imagine that the movie would have been kind of difficult to communicate in the standard sci-fi tropes of the time."
"Or I could be full of shit, which is likely. Re marketing for a more general audience, no other reason not to use the original promotional material. I wonder if they got a lot of calls from viewers complaining about the movie, I know that used to be a thing.  No I think you are absolutely right, it's like anything else, sell people something they know.It's what Alien wouldn't looked like as an A-Team episode. I question whether they make the ad that way specifically to preserve the movie's suspense.Yes she did. At the very end of the movie in the escape pod she finds a spear gun. I remember because one of my college professors said it represented a woman taking phallic power for herself.Normally I would scoff, but there's so much sexual subtext to Alien that I can't say this in particular wasn't intentional."
"Everything in that movie is dicks, vaginas, penetration, and rape.The entire movie just oozes sex and rape. And the weird made up tag line surely...

Where are those now?[Mega Man in Europe is pretty sweet though.](http://i.imgur.com/tZBPGU3.jpg)They're at least *closer*. Also, that chrome-looking Megaman is pretty awesome.My first thought upon seeing the chrome Megaman: [https://youtu.be/jyukifAmPNo](https://youtu.be/jyukifAmPNo)[Interstella 5555?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKkllofI22M)I felt too giddy seeing that. Did you see that space cowboy robot hawt wail on his guitar as his ship turned into a tinier ship, both shaped like a hawks head?  Holy fuck Im not worthy In the 80s, this was standard behavior. People would shred on their axe while buying bread.Dude I used to love that show as a kid!Used to love that show. Had the toys too.That looks fucking awesome.its funny liono had a metal gauntlet and no other medal the guy who looks like the leader is covered in metal except the area were a gauntlet would go."
"Its like they just inverted liono.Omfg that looks hella tightSick guitar.I'd forgotten how good some of the animation was in that intro.Part metal, part real. That is the best description of a thing I've ever heard.How can it be real if it's metal?"
"-Jaden SmithThat theme song was weak - apart from the guitar solo."
"To be honest, it was one step above 'I'm All Out of Love' by Air Supply for dreariness One of the *silver*hawks is gold and the song describes them as a rainbow in the night. Let me guess, the animation during the show was off by a fucking mile from the quality of the intro.Haha... yeah.Is it Silverhawks?."
"[Checks]."
"It's Silverhawks!."
"I swear, nobody remembers this show but me. I was beginning to think it was all just some childhood fever dream, even though I swear I had one of the action figures.Silverhawks was fucking awesome. The cowboy dude...Don't know if it's any consolation to you, but Silverhawks got pretty popular in Mexico for people my age (just turned 30). Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, knows the SILVEEERHAWKS falsetto song thing, even though the show was known as Halcones Galacticos, they left that part in the otherwise translated intro song. The toys were fucking AWESOME when I was a kid, the wings popped out!"
"Not as big as ThunderCats, mind you, but yeah.I had the bull dude action figure as a kid, but just not remembered it.Interesting...so Rankin Bass's follow-up to Thundercats was Shiny Thundercats.Let me introduce the ThunderCats of the Sea."

Cause I'd LOVE to hear it.The new Zelda: A Link Between Worlds handles it pretty well with those seesaw things. Of course, you also need an ice rod.[removed]> she's the only fucker left."
"Jones the cat made it.You kind of get the feeling that she's the main character from the moment she is the only one with the sense to follow quarantine procedures and they all let the face-grabbed guy on the ship anyway. well, I wouldn't have known that if you didn't just ruin it. Also, I don't remember chuck Norris. SPOILER ALERT. Yeesh. Oh wait. It's been 35 years.Everyone and their mother had seen it by the time it reached the censored, cut down, 'Saturday Night Movie' version ;)I wish more movies would take that further. I'd like to see a movie where there truly is no main character until the end. Unfortunately basic hollywood story framing always provides a little extra emphasis on the one character who makes it out alive or wins the prize, etc."
"Alien still focused heavily on Ripley though, there wasn't much question that she was the central focus of the story.Ah, the 70's. Back in the day where the trailer for Wrath of Khan spoiled the entire plot, including Spock's death.That was a big thing with 70s/80s horror. Horror fans worships Ash, but in the original Evil Dead, you wouldn't even know he was the main character until he was the only one left. Even The Thing--Kurt Russell was just part of an ensemble until about halfway through.Was Sigourney well known back then?Jeesuz christ! Spoiler tag pls!Well there's that spoiled. Not that I can blame you, but it's one of those well I wish I didn't know now."
"Kinda like how it'd be really cool for anyone to be able to watch Star Wars for the first time and not know Darth Vader's secret. But that's basically impossible.Reminds me of how the marketing guys spoiled terminator 2 right in the commercial."
"He's back, but this time - for the good guys! Or something to that effect."
"If you watch T2, it's OBVIOUS that Arnold is the bad guy for the first quarter of the film. He's kicking innocent asses, acting robotic and indifferent towards humans while the T1000 is a soft spoken police officer who seems genuinely empathetic."
"Then the reveal, it's glorious."
"But the marketing guys thought everyone should know what's up before even going in.Well, thank you very much for that fucking spoiler.I remember the feeling grow as each one dies. Wait a minute. Is SHE . . . ? I was so proud this pushy mouthy woman was gonna be the hero.They have Skerritt's name ahead of hers, at least. She's up front and is the star but does not get top billing.  I suppose they though, This is a great movie!  But it needs some ray guns and some sexismI didn't have that experience at all. I think it was very apparent that the story focused around her the entire time, I think most people maybe just aren't used to seeing a woman in a lead role in science fiction.Here's how this works:"
"When film comes out the promotion usually plays on enticing the audience and playing on anticipation and what they do not not know yet."
"When the *video, home consuption, television* phase comes about- promotional material is entirely based on hoping the audience has already seen the material and attempts to remind the audience of that experience theyve already had. That is the goal of out of theater promotion- and is why you see DVD covers coming across as way way more revealing and filled with familiar imagery.Kind of like how the Terminator 2 trailer ruined the surprise that the T-800 was there to help Sarah not kill her."
"There's actually a [great article](https://thedissolve.com/features/movie-of-the-week/670-terminator-2-and-the-worlds-biggest-spoiler/) on it.This is what was great about watching T1 and 2 last year with some pop culture innocents. At the time, you couldn't avoid being spoiled for T2 (and yet it was still awesome). Only years later could I be sitting in a room with people who could fully appreciate the rose delivery scene. They were *floored*. It was glorious.Arnold not being a villain might have initially been a twist concept, but it doesn't come off that way at all in the film."
">He doesn't kill anybody in the biker bar, even the last guy who threatens him with a shotgun."
">He gets intoduced with a cool, somewhat fun soundtrack (Bad to the Bone)."
">The T-1000 gets introduced with ominous music, and the first thing it does is murder a cop."
"I never saw the trailer for T2, and it was clear on first watch of the film who the good guy was. But the clothing represented them not what they did."
"bikers are seen as bad guys."
"Police are seen as good guys."
"T-1000 seems human up up until he is shot. He's all nice and friendly asking about conor."
"The t-800 is all red screen POV off the bat. Cold computed dialogue. A skynet terminator."
"coming off the first movie you would not have thought the t-800 was a good guy."
"thats like knowing bruce willis was dead the whole time."
"That music for t-800 was more of a 'remember this badass character from the last movie...well he's back!' type song."
"Its called bad to the bone for christ sake! Bad to the bone!"
"EDIT: t-1000 had the same vibe/music as kyle reese in T1In the director commentary they specifically mentioned how they didn't show T-1000 murder the cop so that it could be vague whether he died or just got knocked out from a punch. I think they should've been more vague about whether Arnold kills any biker or not though, and there's really no reason he shouldn't kill any biker anyways since he hasn't been taught to not kill yet.Even knowing she's the main character I was blown away the first time I watched *Alien*. It's an incredible movie for so many reasons.It's an advert for a broadcast television version.  There's no joy here. Pan-and-scan, tiny screen, chopped up for commercials every ten minutes, edited-for-television. It's not the way you wanted to see it the first time.Man, that's a shame. That was never apparent to me because, well, she's also in all the sequels. Hard to save that knowledge. What did the comment say?He deleted his comment. What did it say? Have you seen Psycho?Uh, yes? Don't see the relevance. Another movie that had a great main character swap that is obvious to future generations but at the time was surprising.Just like how in Terminator 2, [Spoilers](#s you don't know that Arnie is the good guy until he saves John with the box of roses shotgun. There is absolutely zero indication up to that point what the terminators' intentions are.)"
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvK6zH9evRcHe deleted the post! What did he say?!Basically that one of the joys of seeing the movie the first time was not knowing who the main character, and therefore who would survive. This poster puts Ripley front and centre, therefore ruining the surprise. It's kind of similar to how Terminator 2 is supposed to be having you thinking Arnold is looking to kill John Conner but the trailers blew that twist immediately. Fucking AI can't remember, but I don't believe she even got top billing in the movie.I don't think she was much of a star at that pointYeah, it was her first film role.It was her first major role in a film. She appears to have 2 small credits Same. I can't fathom why more horror movies don't do this, though. Instead of having a hierarchy of fame in the cast so you know the less famous people will die first, have a bunch of unknowns and not give any clues as to who is gonna make it to the end (if any)."
"Edit: Yes I know there are some movies that have done this, just not many have done it well.A lot of horror films do do this. I don't recognize any of the people in Unfriended."
"The problem is writing. We've watched so many horror films before we know how it's going to end. What is great about Alien is it guides you in a way where things unfold as suspected... until they reach a point where your expectations have been obliterated.Watch cabin in the woodsBasically The SignalOR cast a really really well known actor and then cast the rest with almost complete unknowns, set up the movie in a way that makes the well known actor as the apparent hero, and kill that actor off first and very abruptly, and just throw the whole audience for a loop.Pretty much every horror movie does this. For one thing, I'd guess that the vast majority of current horror movies don't really have any big name stars in the cast. And for another thing, A LOT of horror/thriller films will cast one big name and kill that person off in the first act. It's a trope of its own, at this point.Deep Blue Sea had Samuel L Jackson get killed off first."
"Does that count?I mean even when nobody famous is in the cast, it's become a standard in dead teenager movies for the down to earth, chaste girl to be the only one alive at the end. In the end though, I think it's just a feature of storytelling that you're going to know who is likely to live because they're going to clearly have a character who the writers devote a lot of development time to beyond the time they can afford to give to any of the smaller roles. Only a few stories tend to go off the script so much that they'll spend a whole story creating a character and developing them and then just off them, much less off them for no narrative reason.Somebody should make a movie where the monster demands that its victims die in a particular order based on their perceived character flaws as part of an elaborate ritual.  That would make an awesome movie.Scream did a pretty good job of it. Drew Barrymore was prominent on the poster and set up for everyone to believe she was the main character. And promptly died within the first 10 minutes.Is that the one where the cute blonde gets chopped by a garage door?"
"That's the one. Although not how Drew Barrymore dies but you've got the right movie.I think the best part of the Friday the 13th remake was the beginning where they mess with people who try to guess who's going to die/in what order.kind of another reason i liked cabin in the woods, going in i thought it was another creezy horror movie...omg blew my mind and i don't like scary movies (which this really isn't that bad), but this was great. It even setup while all other scary movies pretty much exist the way they do.Deep Blue Sea.Probably the single most unexpected thing I've ever seen. 100% did not see it coming.big names sell seats"
"you need to get the big names and kill them off firstYeah, but then you end up in a Godzilla situation and people feel duped. I suppose if you made your secondary characters actually interesting...Psycho and the original Scream did this. I would argue that the plot of Pitch Black is like this. The first one anyways."
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_Black_%28film%29And Pulp Fiction got it right when Johnny T walked out of the shitter with a kid's book in his hand and got blown out of his shoes.I'm going to guess it starts with M and ends with ONEY.Mahoney? Who's that?Must be a Police Academy reference.Matrimoney?Scream was great about this.  Drew Barrymore was top billed and all over the advertisements.... Even the reviewers played along.  I vividly remember one review boldly proclaiming that Drew Barrymore gives a tour de force performance!"
"It's one of the great crushing blows of Alien becoming a franchise. If you watch the original movie with the mindset of Not knowing who... then it's a totally different movie. John Hurt is the obvious cause it's John Hurt, we know John Hurt, he also went to the planet first so he's definitely the OH GOD DINNER IS RUINED, OH! OH....well, it's definitely the bearded American called Dallas cause for fucks sakes, it's a bearded American called Dallas and he's being brave and OH GOD THE BEEPING..."
"And so forth."
"Worth a rewatch from that point of view, just watch and enjoy how background Ripley is. That bit where she doesn't let them in is pure space-cunt that in a modern movie would signify a villain in the tale and she'd So Get Hers When The Killing Started."
"The lack of an immediately identifiable survivor is one of the glories of Alien, narratively speaking. As someone who is rewatching the whole anthology to introduce my 12 year old to it, you are right on. Hell I almost forgot who was gonna make out of the first one. There was a lot of Ripley in the [theatrical trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjLamj-b0I8) so they kinda hinted at it, but you just made me think how great it would have been for Kane to call out in the hypersleep vault, Rise and shine, Ellen (instead of Lambert) and the first thing she says is Call me Ripley."
"The fact that space travel terminology borrows so much from nautical and the fact that both the stories culminate in a fight for survival with a monster, and then Ripley being the lone survivor - that would have been fucking brilliant. That's where the original Friday the 13th really succeeds. A general understanding of the franchise makes the original all the more surprising. I feel like even approaching it that way, it becomes obvious by the time Dallas dies that Ripley is the protagonist (although I feel Dallas is the protagonist for the first half regardless and Ripley sort of plays as an antagonist during that first half).Space-cunt? More like the only one using her fucking brain. You taught me something today, I clearly need to give this a rewatch now.As someone who saw 2nd movie before the 1st one that actually explains a lot about people's affection towards Alien. When you watch it and you expect Ripley and u dont get Ripley the movie definitely loses out to Aliens. > space-cunt"
"I'm gonna have to find a way to work this into my everyday language now."
"I want to take some kind of treatment to selectively delete all knowledge I have of *Alien* and then watch it again.OH GOD, THE BEEPING! That is one of the scariest scenes I've ever watched."
"yeah, the only movie where I ever experienced this otherwise was the Evil Dead remake. That was the best thing about that movie.To me it felt like not letting them in was the responsible think and so she'd be the one to survive. But obviously that was knowing she was the main character.> It's one of the great crushing blows of Alien becoming a franchise."
"Almost everything that made Alien such a great horror film is ruined by it being a franchise."
"The xenomorph isn't nearly as scary, as it's known to us (Shit, with the second Ripley took down a nest of them almost on her own.  I dunno if you can claim it all because of the reactor explosion, but she still went in, got what she was after, and got out)."
"We know who the survivor is."
"We know what the xeno is capable of (assuming a standard host for the face hugger)."
"I firmly believe that the Alien franchise is almost impossible to get right as a horror movie now, as much as I hope to be proven wrong.I love the 2nd film so much, but the story took a terribly wrong turn with Alien3; it had a great director, and the performances were also great, but it just basically took us to the same place."
"Dark Horse had this incredible Aliens sequel comic focusing on Newt & Hicks, which turned the Xenomorphs loose on Earth....it was everything that I had hoped, and made perfect sense, and I was convinced that it was going to be the third film, but, sadly, we got the stupid prison :("
"I realize Cameron wasn't really available at that time due to T2, and subsequently True Lies, but if he could have filmed the Dark Horse story, it would've been worth waiting until 1996 for - I dare say it might have given ID4 a run for its money!I am so glad that I watched Alien for the first time last year with no expectations about what would happen and no idea who lived and who died. Such an awesome movie.My parents simulated this effect by showing me Alien when I was 8. Can honestly say I didn't think Ripley was the main character; I thought Dallas was, because if a character's named after Texas, they're probably the main character (so went my 8 year old logic)."
"I didn't sleep very soundly that night. Thanks mom and dad.In the summer of 1979, I was twelve, and my Dad took me & my two younger brothers to see The Muppet Movie; in the same theater they were playing Alien; on our way out of the theater, I stepped through the doors where Alien was showing, expecting to get a spine-tingling eyeful of *the forbidden*!"
"It was only for a minute or two, and from a sci-fi standpoint I guess it was cool to get a look at the interior of the Nostromo....unfortunately it was the scene about the Bonus Situation, so, nothing scary there."
"Looking back, I wish I would have found a way to get into the theater after my parents had gone to bed (or during the day - I was unsupervised & it wouldn't have been too long of a bike ride)."
"I would have loved to have seen Alien, Dawn of the Dead, and Phantasm....I'd just have to buy some popcorn for an 18+ y/o and they'd have said I was their little bro or something!Capitalizing your trope titles.  I like you.  You Will Be Spared.That bit where she doesn't let them in......"
"If I let it in the ship could become infected."
"If I break quarantine I risk all our lives."
"Your evaluation is off. The movie is establishing Ripley as the moral high ground.> That bit where she doesn't let them in is pure space-cunt that in a modern movie"
"At that point in the movie, she's basically Burke or Gormon from Aliens. Which is delicious to reflect on."
"And she's the one going around telling people company regulations and how they'll get their share for salvage. She's the company-man.Man, I never saw it that way. Anyone who's spent any time in a biolab understands the dangers of contamination, which are then illustrated further by the movie. Ripley is totally and completely right, and even if it had turned out to be nothing, she'd still have been right. edit to add this: Also the tone of the scene doesn't provide contrast between her attitude and Ash's... it doesn't present him as sympathetic for the audience to relate to. While I get the point about how the scene would be played differently now, I don't think it is intended to present Ripley as negative. I mean, the movie's called ALIEN and its commercial scared the shit out of everybody... we all know she's right.Gorman was a good guy. He was just in over his head. He wasn't in any way a villain.I gotta disagree."
"She's following protocol, designed to prevent some horrible alien virus or organism from getting onto the ship. Which is exactly what fucking happens when the other crew violate protocol."
"Gormon was an incompetent rookie and Burke was a company stooge. Not to mention a complete bastard."
"Ripley follows the rules because there's a reason for the rules. Sure, she comes off as an officious cunt, but she's neither incompetent nor malevolent. Exactly! It's at this point in the film where you start to see Ripley's strength. She doesn't fuck around, whether it's trying to stop a hostile alien organism from coming aboard the ship to blowing up a fucking huge ship just to try and kill it."
"There's a really good reason for everything she does, and I think her ability to survive is a good mirror of the Aliens ability to kill - they're both not controlled by emotion, sure, Ripley gets angry and scared, but she keeps it together unlike the other characters (even the robot!)."
"I guess you could say she's 'the company man' at the beginning of the film and I reckon she's distant from the other crew, because she's there to do a job, not make friends. I suppose that could make her out as a bad person to other people watching the film, but I find it hard to see because I have a very similar personally trait."
"> she's distant from the other crew"
"It seems to me that the job these guys were doing would tend to select for rugged, individualist loners. They're in space for a long time doing grunt work in rather bleak surroundings. They'd be unlikely to have family back at home considering how long they needed to be in cryo-sleep. I think it's completely understandable that she's tough & quiet. I'm actually surprised how warm some of the others seem (Parker yapping it up during dinner, Brett being so concerned about Jones the cat.) Ripley being so stern seems appropriate for the scenario.Something people seem to be missing is that she is the ship's XO, which means it is her job to be the by the book disdciplinarian. Dallas being the Captain is supposed to be a bit more nuanced and thoughtful in action, thus he is the one who decides to hunt the alien down. An XO is in that position to learn how to think like a captain based on a lot of book learning and rule following. A captain is there to make decisions based on education, rule following, and situational awareness.  Later in the movie and series we see Ripley showing more command experience because, after all, combat is the greatest teacher in terms of survival and response to danger. She morphs from being the untested neophyte into the leading lady through surviving.Ripley was third in command. Kane was the XO.Nuke it from orbit. It's the only way to be sure."
"Yeah, she's not fucking around.True, but I took that also to be the result of her being deeply traumatized by her one-on-one encounter with the xenomorph at the end of Alien. None of us would have come out of that without being a bit messed up and seriously antagonistic towards that species.I've never experienced one because they are fiction, but if they did exist I'd recommend we build a Death Star and point it at whatever planet they are on."
"I think she was being 100% level headed. I still don't understand how there's even any discussion to be had over it: nuking it from orbit isn't a joke, it's literally the only rational course of action.I'm not saying it's a perfect analogy, more that's what she was set up to appear to be."
"It's usually people who don't follow protocol who get to be the heroes.I got what you meant."
"Ripley goes through a transformation in those films. But she's still kind of the same person. She's incredibly responsible, and I think when she doesn't want to let them in, it isn't just following protocol, she *respects* protocol. She wants the rest of the ship to be safe, she needs to return home to be with her daughter."
"But at first glance, she does seem like that selfish woman in horror films who care about the rules. But if they actually did what she wanted, none of that would've happened anyways.That bit where she doesn't let them in is pure space-cunt that in a modern movie would signify a villain in the tale and she'd So Get Hers When The Killing Started. This is excellent. It identifies how much of programming is arguably propaganda compared to the greater possibilities of art.The more I read about the original Alien the more amazed I am of how perfect of a horror movie it really is."
"In a similar vain,  I think it  was amazing that Scream had Drew Barrymore on the cover.That was another classic moment of Holy Shit I Can't Believe The Main Character Died! if you were watching it unspoiled.I felt that way watching The Thing. The Thing is different in that you know Kurt Russell will be there at the end ... you just don't know which side he will be on.The first time I saw Alien, being the big name actor that he was, I honestly thought John Hurt was the main character. He dies and I am  all WTF?. Then I thought that maybe  Skerrit, with his position, would be the main character. Nope. Very well written.I thought it was gonna be Skerrit. Oddly enough, he was relatively new at the time and Hurt was the big name. And Ash, I can't think of his name but he was a very big name actor back then.I'm so jealous of everyone who got to watch this with out prior knowledge to anything about the franchise."
"I knew that Ripley was the main character, I also had all the big scares spoilt for me (egg hatching scene and the chestburster)."
"I wonder if future generations will be able to watch films like Alien or The Empire Strikes Back without knowing the twists. Heck, I'd imagine most Game of Thrones spoilers will be common knowledge at that point. Whatever happened to the thrill of story telling? *sigh*Well GoT is turning to pure shit anyway, so no loss there. The book spoilers on the other hand... That'll suck.Seriously, this actually ruined the movie a good deal for me. Not that I didn't enjoy it or think it was well done but I kept waiting for each person to die. Really killed the tensionI've heard similar thoughts as it regards T2 and the question of whether Arnie is good or bad. I know nothing about game of thrones other than hodor... hodor."
"I'll probably never watch it.This is unfortunately why I had to watch all leaked GOT season 5 episodes within 48 hours.I had a Ripley action figure years before I actually saw the movie.I was too young to see the movie when it came out. By the time I did watch it many years later, I had seen so many pop culture references to the chestburster scene that I knew the general gist of what happened without having actually seen it.wait...are you trying to say that not being able to experience classic stories without spoilers/prior knowledge is a new thing?"
"Shakespeare."
"The Illiad/Odyssey/Aeneid."
"Basically every Greek tragedy."
"The bible. I still haven't started on GoT and the only spoilers I know are lots of people die and a guy called Hodor says 'Hodor' a lot. One of my regrets is seeing the original Star Wars trilogy so early on in life, so early that I can't remember seeing Empire Strikes Back for the first time.  Instead it feels like I inherited knowledge of the plot in utero."
"However, I did manage to make it to the age of 14 before seeing Alien and my parents did a great job of revealing nothing, so I got the full dinner scene shit storm.  I also remember being surprised that Ripley was the lone survivor because she hadn't felt like the main character at all to start.You are joking aren't you? The new generation can't even watch a bloody trailer for a movie without it pretty much revealing the entire plot, including spoilers and the end.Some time (about a year or so ago) I was following the 250 top listed in IMDB from top to bottom. Then I reached Alien. I knew almost nothing about the movie, just about the appearance of the alien from Alien vs Predator, which I didn't actually watch. I also cussed because wow, what is this B film doing in such a good position?."
"I didn't read synopses, saw trailers or posters - except for the IMDB one that I didn't pay much attention to. Dived right into it. Came out on the other side finding it one of the best movies I had ever watched. Even Aliens surpassed my expectations (although I was a bit wiser at that time). Love the series.I saw it as a kid. Maybe 7 or 8 years old (thanks Dad, good call). It was absolutely horrifying. And fascinating. I'm a grown-ass man and I only have anything approaching nightmares maybe once a year or less, but when I do, 60% of the time, it's fucking aliens every time."
"And it's still one of my favorite movies.not to mention dem panties. It's actually the opposite way around. With so much less media in general, everybody pretty much saw everything when it came out. Which meant that, if anything, people were MORE likely to already know spoilers than we are today.I have personally experienced the joy of watching some twelve-year-olds find out that Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker's dad in real time. Wait, what?? they said, their minds blown."
"Remember: everyone has to learn this at some point after they are born. For some people, it will be the first time they watch the movie.I was able to watch the first Alien movies without having been spoilt anything at all. I was so scared and was always at the tip of my chair, the suspense buildup was superb. After some of the big suspense points, I took a break from the movie, trying to comprehend what all just happened. It's just such a great movie.I'm 34. I've never seen Alien, but have always wanted to. Thanks, reddit!You definitely need to watch it all alone, with a good bourbon or scotch, and a good cigar, late at night, in the dark, in a very closed off room. Have two stiff ones and continue drinking just enough to keep that disoriented buzz on. I swear to god you'll shit yourself!> with a good bourbon or scotch, and a good cigar"
"Fucking hell, try harder to sound sophisticated, nerdass. I'm 46, a combat veteran with multiple combat deployments, married twice, lost the first to a car wreck and the second to PTSD, have a degree in history, am a newspaper journalist and editor, and am being called a nerd by some chickenshit 13 year-old on the internet. Zounds!Not just sophisticated but *badass* too? Jeepers you sure showed me, huh, Mister? o_o; Mah pah is gonna be awful sore I mouthed off to mah elders, ima get the switch for sure. You know, I'm sure someone, somewhere, at some point in your life, will give a flying fuck about you. Just not here.Did someone change the Navy Seal copypasta?Good lord. Should I add that I have a gut, haven't been in a bar fight in better than 20 years, can't do a pull up any more because I'm lazy, much less rassle, and drive a decade old corrolla? :DAs a nerd with an empty bottle of scotch on the table next to me and a humidor in my room.... I have no idea how to feel about anything right nowI'd say you've made a good start.weed is the true fear inducer. alcohol will make it easier!Cigars can cause the final result! sounds messy.I like you.You might want to add adult diaper to your list of supplies.Not a bad idea! He can sit there for the whole series that way.> egg hatching scene"
"the good news is that the egg was on the poster and in the tv trailer. everyone in the theater knew something bad was inside the egg."
"In fairness, there is a joy in knowing the ending (at times) because watching how the web of inevitability closes in on the character/situation can be more brutal and affecting than a surprise."
"Point in case, Of Mice and Men. Knowing what's coming...It can also lead to a huge increase in tension. My wife spoiled a character's death for me in an episode of Breaking Bad, but she didn't spoil the *details*, the when, who, and how. So every scene with that character suddenly became incredibly tense.Or Romeo & Juliet. Every adaptation you see, you hold out hope that Romeo will just wait a couple seconds...This is so true of a good adaptation of R&J - and the reason I think that it keeps getting adapted and performed.> So Get Hers When The Killing Started"
"don't even bring TV Tropes into this, playoffs are starting and GTA V is downloading I DON'T HAVE THE TIME FOR THIS[deleted]Is it a documented trope though? I can't seem to find it.Click at your own risk: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfMortalityBecause of this I was able to guess the killer in every Law and Order episode by the first commercial break. What are doing? Trying to lure people in!?This whole idea that tv tropes will suck you in has really jumped the shark.It's still true in the sense that it's a time sink, but I just can't stand the style it's written in. It's like an incredibly helpful encyclopedia written by the most rabid of fanboys/girls."
"I also don't like how far the bar has fallen for crowning moments. Was any kind of joke made? CROWNING MOMENT OF FUNNY. Did a basic action scene happen? CROWNING MOMENT OF AWESOME. Did a shadow move in the background? I literally shit my pants from HIGH OCTANE NIGHTMARE FUEL. Also, why do they let the most sheltered, innocent people write the Getting Crap Past The Radar entries?"
"I guess it frustrates me because the idea of a website like this is awesome on paper, but in practice it just becomes an overly enthusiastic list of things that happened in media. Didn't mean for this to turn into a rant, but apparently I have a lot of hate in my heart for this site and it all came spilling out today.Because anyone can edit it, so the worst types of people that can both understand the awful formatting of the pages when editing and are big enough fanboys to actually edit tvtropes are the most common writers.Probably because they're viewed from within the context of the show. One show's Crowning Moment of Awesome might not be as awesome as another show's same thing. But it still counts as the most awesome moment of that show."
"I find its less fun to read the individual lists than it is much more fun to read lists on shows that  I like. The trope list for the TV show [Bottom](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bottom), for example, is really entertaining. Plus it also contains the best description of the show around:"
">The Brit Com, stripped down to its absolute minimum requirements: two idiots, sharing a living space, passing the Idiot Ball back and forth so fast that you can't distinguish between the two.Yeah, I understand that. And actually I think crowning moment of awesome is considered a your mileage may vary trope now so you won't see it listed in the main trope listings on a page anymore."
"While I don't always agree with finding something to be funny or what have you, I think it's fair that they break down certain tropes from the perspective of someone who enjoys the given piece of art/show/literature. It helps me to perhaps reconsider some shows that I initially thought inferior by seeing how passionate fans can draw attention to the way they use tropes well. I find I start to enjoy less preferred show more as a result."
"Just my two cents. Don't know that it has that effect on everyone. At least they got rid of Troper's TalesHey I enjoyed troper's tales. http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingTheSharkThank you for adding value and context to this conversation and not at all annexing the rest of my afternoon for trope research."
"I sincerely do not get what is so intriguing about tv tropes, i have never spent more than 4 minutes there.Nice ray gun. When you've got nothing to lose, pew pew.> When you've got nothing to lose."
"Sounds like a tagline to a movie about the production of Terminator GenysisSaid Ripley to the android Bishop."
"Are we not doing phrasing anymore?One of the most memorable moments of my life, I was watching The Incredible Hulk with my best friend, and Bill Bixby almost got cured, I was so happy, and my best friend grabbed the tv guide and said, HE'S NOT GETTING CURED THERE'S AN EPISODE NEXT WEEK."
"I was so crushed I cannot convey how happy this made my friend.But you would never have heard that sad piano music at the end again. I was so crushed , the music was already playing.I thought you meant Bill Bixby getting cured of cancer. :-(I mean, maybe the entire next episode would have been David Banner talking about how awesome it was not being the Hulk anymore?75% of those old Hulks were someone talking about doing something, and boring subplots about some missing kid or something."
"And then Banner would turn into the Hulk and some good stuff would happen. 70s super-group Alien."
"From left to right: Gary Numan, Kenny Rogers, Grace Slick and  BB King."
"lol. if there were more people here that understood what you posted, you'd have all the recs. This is hilarious, although I'm thinking Dallas looks more like Kenny Loggins.I miss TV Guide. I know it's still around but back in the day it was a MUST have.I used to go to a channel, 63, and they would cycle the TV schedule every 5 min or so. It was awesome. I found AMC that way, when they showed more movies. I remember when I was 16 in 1999 and FINALLY got cable.  I used to watch the TV Guide channel for 15 straight minutes to figure out what I wanted to watch.I was utterly puzzled when I went to the TV Guide channel one day a few years ago and they didn't have the scroll. It was just full screen some made for TV movie. I had no idea what was on, I was so scared."
"That's about when I gave up watching any TV but baseball.[This](http://www.tvgohome.com) is better though. And in many ways more accurate, even now.Remember the indication if the program was in color or black and white? I watched the Seinfeld episode about the TV Guide last night, so awesomely nostalgic!TV Guide and Reader's Digest. I never read Reader's Digest though. [deleted]Kif, send that to 'Humor in Uniform.'I contend that one of the best articles I've ever read about The Shining was in a TV Guide."
"It was when they were doing that shitting [TV Series of The Shining](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118460/), and basically this author tore the TV show apart and explained with depth and heart about how much better the movie was."
"I wish I would have saved that article.  And, seeing it was almost 20 years ago, I'm sure the article wouldn't be nearly as good a read today, without my rose colored glasses.  But, damn, I remember it being great.  ~~Sorry to burst your bubble but you're misremembering something or maybe you were too young to understand at the time.~~"
"I assume you're talking about the The Shining TV mini-series that had the funny guy from the old show Wings as Jack Torrence. That show was created by Stephen King (the author) because he didn't like how Stanley Kubrick's movie strayed so far from the book. The mini-series followed the novel almost directly. The movie was awesome, especially considering it's a horror movie, but it was nowhere near as terrifying as the book. That's what prompted King to create the mini-series."
"**edit:** [Here ya' go.](http://thetruthinsidethelie.blogspot.com/2013/04/tv-guide-april-26-1997.html?m=1) ~~Found the article for you.~~ :)"
"Edit2: OP meant the author of the article liked the movie. I thought he meant Stephen King liked the movie."
"The mini-series was shit.  It got shit reviews, it got shit viewing numbers, and history will remember it as shit, no matter how closely it followed the book and regardless of how much King hated Kubrick's movie."
"That was the point of the piece in TV Guide.  Sorry, pal, but I'm not misremembering that. >basically this author tore the TV show apart and explained with depth and heart about how much better the movie was."
"I'm sorry. All of this is false. I feel like an ass, now. But I'm just trying to be helpful."
"I posted the article in my previous comment if you'd like to re-read it. Nope, that's not the article.  I remember the article had a still from the movie, the one of Danny wearing the sweater with the Appolo rocket on it.  Again, it was more of a review that a feature article, and surely a counterpoint to that 10 out of 10 review they gave it."
"I'm not crazy, I know I read this."
"I might back down a bit on the everyone thought it was shit comment, I'll downshift to it got mixed reviews (with the [comments section of the IMDB pages](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118460/reviews?start=20) particularly relevant here), but I'll definitely stand by which version history will remember better."
"Often faithful does not equal good"
"I had for years the Cheers last episode tv guide and it was awesome. It had the final tally of Norms bar tab and toms of awesome facts on the show. How many drinks different characters drank etc.I remember the fold out cover with the cast reading over a printout of the tab. Classic Norm. At one time I owned every issue of TV Guide with an X-Files cover.yeah I remember learning in High School (the 90's) that it was the most subscribed to magazine. I was kind of amazed by that fact but it made sense. I visit their site a lot.  I actually like it better now.  They have a lot more articles and critical reviews of movies and shows, now that they don't have to devote a fixed percentage of paper pages to giving program times.  They've adapted really well.I sold re-subscriptions to TV Guide in the early 90's through a place called Dial-America."
"We had around a $1.25 commission on each re-subscribe."
"That magazine helped put gas in my car, food in my cupboards, and got me through the first 2 years of college."
"The most subs I got in 4 hours of working the phones was 95 when we got new leads in at the start of every week.   Very popular magazine for sure and most every one we called would tell us to just renew it without having to listen to the script."
"Such an easy payday with that magazine..Wait, you have a TV?"
"No. I just like to read the TV Guide. Read the TV Guide, you don't need a TV.The most crucial for me was the two week version at Christmas. I would have a colour coded system of marking up what I wanted to watch, TV programmes, films and then films I wanted to VHS record. Pretty sad, but I think I enjoyed the organising as much as the watching!I've always been a fan of the 3 R's."
"Reading TV Guide."
"Writing to TV Guide."
"And....uh....Renewing TV Guide!It sure was. And it helped me teach my daughter to read while also making me a firm believer in the three R's: Reading TV Guide, Writing to TV Guide, and Renewing TV Guide!We just had listings in our local paper, never subbed to TV Guide.It was in the Sunday edition of our paper  TV guides were for rich people.Read the TV Guide, you don't need a TV.The truth. When something was shown once and then, quite possibly, NEVER again, you had to plan that shit out.[deleted]Absolutely! In my case there was only one TV at home during that time, so it was a struggle to convince my folks to let me watch a movie I was waiting for."
"Those were the days. No kidding.  I remember the thrill of seeing that my favorite episode of of some show was going to be rerun at 1:00 a.m. in the morning Thursday night on some obscure UHF channel and planning to sneak downstairs accordingly.  [There's only one good show on UHF.] (http://i.imgur.com/ATlhg.gif)Plus, you didn't really *know* what might be on in the next few days. Sure they advertised but not everything. It was great finding something cool coming on that you didn't know about.I used to get it around Thanksgiving just to see what the Turkey Day lineup was for MST3k.It was great for those random weekdays when I'd fake sick to stay home from school. Oh hey, Blazing Saddles is on after Price is Right!I had Ferris Bueller's Day Off on VHS and I watched it every time I stayed home in high school, legitimately sick or not.Man, I loved watching game shows when I was home fake sick (or real sick). The Price is Right, Test Your Luck, Hollywood Squares. Those were the days. Nothing to worry about except what to watch next.You Fool!Press Your Luck, I think you mean. NowhammynowhammynowhammySTOP."
"And then over to Channel 4 for Mr. Belvedere and Charles in Charge.Haha, I almost typed The Whammy Show!Reminds me of the Married with Children episode where Al desperately does as much as he can in order to see Hondo. A John Wayne movie that is only shown once every 17 years, but ends up missing it because he gets trapped in a store when he needed to buy batteries for a flashlight.At least he got to catch some of the psycho dad marathon later on.Hondo is a great movie*Your lives are meaningless compared to Hondo!**Now, I want* ***silence***! *Not a whinny, not a moo, not a peep. Hondo time.*Wow an illustrated poster for a TV ad. You never see that kind of effort today.I hope the new Star Wars movie keeps that tradition alive.Drew Struzan plzI wish Marvel would release drawn posters since they have an entire building of talented artists working for them."
"[EDIT: They do it for their TV shows however (AoS S2).](http://imgur.com/gallery/xagWi) [Daredevil.](http://imgur.com/0aJB2n6)They've occasionally had a poster artist do something for them, but yeah, why doesn't Marvel hire one of their comic artists to do a poster for one of their films? It would make a pretty cool DVD sleeve too.Because they're not looking to appeal to comic book neckbeards, in fact they're deliberately trying to market away from that image.Uhhh... you mean like their entire character campaign for Age of Ultron?"
"http://www.impawards.com/2015/avengers_age_of_ultron_ver3.htmlYou mean the absolute most recent project while completely ignoring ALL their past movies?Why is Thor's arm so stubby?? You try hurling lightning around and see if your arm hair isn't getting constantly singed off."
"Edit: yes, I read it as stubbly and I'm leaving it because I still think it's a solid joke. Boy that hawkeye closeup poster is straight retardo looking.That's *concept art*, I'm talking about *comic book art.*"
"Like if Alex Ross or John Romita Jr. did a poster. Not Ryan Meinerding."
"Also I'm speaking more about a wide release poster. Not something they put up at Comic-Con.[I think you'd fit in here](http://i.imgur.com/dsLiDtz.jpg).What game developers and movie makers show as concept art is more often polished promo art or illustrations made after the concept/design is pretty much finished. Actual concept art can be very rough and going in strange directions so it's rarely shown to the public. The idea with concept art is to quickly explore many ideas so doing fancy paintings (1-3 days each) early on and hoping to just nail the design right away is rarely done. Sometimes an early drawing is turned into a more polished illustration though, sort of flowing with the project as it evolve. However, those Ultron paintings above have compositional qualities you rarely see in concept art.You're right, but it is done by one of Marvel Studios' concept artists, and it's probably done during production for promotion as you've said. It still doesn't make it a drawing by a comic book artist.You do see a decent amount of Star Wars concept art though. There's a lot of Boba Fett sketches and stuff like that. But even those are still fairly 'down the track'.That's not concept art that was put out at comic con, those are ACTUAL POSTERS for an ACTUAL CAMPAIGN that has been printed on buildings all across major cities."
"But I understand what you want now, real comic book art, not just something that's drawn. That's all you had to say Those are photoshopped images. They're not drawn at all bro. He clearly said drawn artwork. I work in entertainment advertising. They are drawn...It doesn't matter where you work. Those are not hand drawn. They are heavily photoshopped photographs of the talent.You still don't understand. When this poster was made the artists literally did not have the assets to make these - they HAD to be drawn, everything.>why doesn't Marvel hire **one of their comic artists** to do a poster for one of their films?"
"That is what I said, but thanks for your condescending response.Going by that pic I would've been bummed by the absence of laser pistols.In space, no one can hear your soul, brother."
"Best I can tell from the poster it's starring my elementary school librarian Mrs. Brenner, Eric Clapton, Carla Devito from those Meatloaf videos and the Allstate guy. Dallas looks like Al Borland from Home Improvement.This is the sequel, Alien Disco Spy. It's not very popular. More on point than [Poland's poster!](http://i.imgur.com/UMDJgH9.jpg)It's got an unknown entity getting ready to burst out of a ribcage. I'd say it couldn't get much more on point than that.Need an Alien?"
"Why not Zoidberg?I never knew the Nostromo had a disco in it."
"She was just a everyday city girl on the space beat when her day was interrupted by a smooth talking jive-turkey alien.Why does Ripley have that gun? Much of the horror of the first film was the fact it was a bunch of space truckers with whatever defenses they could jury rig together against an unstoppable, stealthy killing machine.The franchise takes that brilliant conceit, tries a few permutations, and eventually wastes it shamefully."
"* Alien: truckers caught in a spot doing what they can; noble effort; shredded"
"* Aliens: super-duper space marines, stitched up by the man; noble effort; shredded"
"* Alien^3: the worst criminals in the galaxy; end up noble (sort-of); shredded"
"* Alien Resurrection: comedy space pirates; meh; shredded"
"* Prometheus: the smartest, best equipped experts-in-this-sort-of-thing that the Earth has to offer; run around like fucking idiots; shredded and rightly so, you waste of protoplasm"
"To redditors under 20, this was called a TV Guide.  It was the greatest pooping accessory known to civilized man.Actually, that is the back of the Glade air-freshener can. You only wish you remembered to bring the TV Guide.Man, Sunday night movie used to be such a big deal. It wasn't like you could just rent/download stuff at home back then.The MusicalIsn't that Duane Dibbley (Cat) from Red Dwarf on the ladder? I......don't get it?It's an ad from when Alien was first shown on TV. It completely misrepresents the movie and shows the characters doing things that were never in the movie.Pretty sure Parker climbed a ladder thoYou should crosspost this to /r/LV426!The black guy (I can't remember anyone's names other than Ripley, Dallas and Ash) looks like he has Vulcan hair.Parker.WHERE ARE THOSE PICTURES OF SPIDERMAN?When is this from?It looks like the cover of a Choose Your Own Adventure book... (one I would totally read by the way)I remember scanning the Cinemax and Showtime movie listings for strong sexual content.Dwayne Dibbley!TV Guide - the originators of printed lens-flareWhen you've got nothing to lose there's nothing you won't try."
"Like Alien sex?"
"Or was that in Alien2?Alien Resurrection, I think.> Like Alien sex? Or was that in Alien2?"
"Yup, the alien fucked Bishop pretty hard."
"I really miss old, hand-drawn movie posters and covers. Especially the ones for the 80s horrors that had absolutely nothing to do with the content of the movie.That phrase you keep using (on point)... I do not think it means what you think it means. From the creators of Nailed It comes the new soon to be universally hated term, On Point!"
"Use On Point everywhere you used Nailed It to yield even greater hate! Post some random gif of a guy doing something slightly cool on the internet? On Point is there. Something random you saw on the street so you had to whip out our phone to take a picture even though you're doing 50 in a 35? On Point is there. A drawing of a video game character? On Point is there."
"Get On Point today.That phrase has been around a while but I swear in the last week I've heard it dozens of times, compared to rarely before. What the hell made it suddenly a thing?What does on point mean (serious)?Holy shit I hate that phrase.You want to hate a phrase? Because that's how you get people to hate a phraseLoved the gun, on point!But, they had their lives to lose!I didn't know Tom Skerritt was the star of Alien. Good old mid-80's TV guide.  Planned out my after school activities for the entire week.Everyone in the background is doing something but not looking at what they are doing. Thats not how you survive in space. Wow.  That was the night I first watched Alien.  I remember that it was the network premiere.  Thanks for this.Wow.... A TV Guide...Ah Ripleys famous space pistol..... waitAs seen on http://70sscifiart.tumblr.com/*Drawing by I. Didntseethefilm.*It looks like the film's about an interracial four-way that was clinched in a fuck it all moment in space.I don't get it.In some ways I kind of miss watching the ABC re-edits of movies (as I imagine they did with some of the more gory moments in Alien). I remember watching a Cheech and Chong movie on ABC in which they replaced all mention of pot with diamonds. It was actually kind of impressive.No shit?  I'd like to see that version; anyone got a link?I remember watching this on TV fir the first time as a kid. When the Alien popped out of that dudes stomach I got scared that an alien was going to pop out of the folds of the couch. I didn't sit on that couch for a month. I was five. Crazy Too Many Cooks 80's Aliens portion vibe from this.is that really what they are suggesting with that tag line? seems more about a woman ready to make some wild choices by the 80s standards..It's interesting to see how Tom Skerritt has higher credit value than Sigourney Weaver at this point in time.How was Sigourney Weaver not top billing!?! This was AFTER the movie was a huge hit.For a second I thought they gave Yaphet Kotto a bowl cut.I don't remember [Al Borland](http://brokelyn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/al-borland.jpg) being in Alien...?[Dwayne Dibley!](https://36.media.tumblr.com/93ea22108b72351fc8f3747f229bc967/tumblr_nm5ft48zco1tkw1e1o1_500.jpg) So Alien was set in the Red Dwarf universe?WTF was wrong with 'In space, no-one can hear you scream'?Good but needs more Jonesy. Err, and I'm pretty sure they had something to lose during the entire film. is that a tv guide?Dr. McCoy to sick bay, stat!Those people look quite similar in many respects to the actors in the actual movie.I'm not doing anything until we talk about the bonus situation.Tagline sounds like the porno parody*Alien: Disco Nights*At least they got the ladder right.It reminds me of Robert Heinlein's Friday paperback cover:"
"https://syntheticsean.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/heinlein-friday.jpgEn pointeNice! Alien on Atari!From what I've gathered the correct term is now On Fleek instead of on point. I won't call the swag police but next time you might not be so lucky. How is this absolutely on point?  Are you a robot for ABC trying to advertise to us an old movie?"
"BTW, awesome movieHad no idea Kenny Rogers was in Alien!It's been awhile since I watched Alien but from what I can remember its one of the few horror movies where no one was out right stupid. They all died simply because they were unprepared for the Alien threat. Awesome movie. Though I kind of prefer Aliens.ripley probably wishes she actually had that laser gun in the movieI dont get it?*THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE GUNS IN ALIEN..* they had flamethrowers..I can see a chest-burster in that advert - and it ain't the alien I'm talkin' bout.Sigourney was in my buddy's shop today in NYC. So umm...funny this was on the front page.Get your VCR cued up and ready to record!It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything. If I heard that tagline I'd never have matched it to this movie.Is that Kris Kristofferson?Meh.. we already have Richard Chamberlain's face from SHOGUN,"
"just make it Skerrit's! Who'll know!Am I right to assume the headline is a subtle jab at the increasingly irrelevant network? Perhaps crafted by some clever ABC underling? [Skerritt](http://previews.123rf.com/images/bigredlynx/bigredlynx1203/bigredlynx120300090/12891052-Wok-Chef-Stock-Vector-cartoon.jpg)Unfortunately this applies to the entire franchise, now.Sigourney not the first name. Come on. ^^Hey that looks like a fun sci-fi romp for all the family!"
"Laser blasters & shiny computers for little Jimmy and skin-tight jumpsuits & cleavage for Daddy! I'm sure this'll go down well with the kids, we all loved Star Wars and are ready for a New Space Adventure!"
"Cue tears and nightmares until puberty.I don't know if you can say the ad is on point when it makes Alien look like some kind of family friendly space adventure."
"I have a feeling there were some traumatized kids that night."
"ha! it looks like a choose you're own adventure kids novel.Your talking about Anal right?I don't get it. How are they on point? Also, she is holding a gun. There were no guns on the Nostromo. OMG it's you again! Mike freaking Pants. Always loved the cast in this movie: Ripley, Viper, Bilbo Baggins, Ollivander, Mr. Big.  There's an alien too.I think you meant Lt. Giardello, or Gee.  [deleted]I got my mom to take me to the theater to see it, I think I was about 11 or 12. Experienced psychological damage from the lunch scene.Erm... kids have access to the same movies you do. I bet a few of them might even have seen the original Star Wars.I totally forgot how terrible promo art could be back then.At least there was freedom of style back then. Now everything looks exactly the same. 5, 6, 23, 24, hike!I miss that TVGuide artwork.  It was often amazingly good.Why they give the brotha a Chemical Romance haircut though...I'm personal friends with Tom Skerritt. Pretty sweet.I'm amazed that Alien was shown on ABCThe most amazing part of this is finding out Weaver didn't get top billing for the first filmWhy was Tom Skerritt billed first? Why does Ripley look like Mary Elizabeth Manstrantonio? Now I understand why her name is Sigourney Weaver.  Wow look at that do!Is this for real or photoshopped?  My father's coming to visit his granddaughter this weekend, and I know he watched it that night.  I'll have to see if he remembers this advert.Wow, a genuine TV Guide. I haven't seen one of those in years. Thanks OP.Whew! Sigourney lookse like Rocky Dennis, Tom Skerritt looks like Richard Chamberlain, and Yaphett Kotto looks like Michael Clarke Duncan. they did get John Hurt, though...Going to see it on the big screen tonight at the Alamo DrafthouseSurely that can't be... Bones McCoy, back left...? Did he get thrown out of StarFleet and end up on a tramp steamer?What is she doing with a gun in space?Haha that's awesome I want that in a frameCool, so the alien shows up, and they shoot it in two minutes, roll credits."
"That's not the poster for Argo?An interracial gangbang?Is this current or from back in The Day?Where the hell did you find this? What is it?  A ^TVGUIDE from 1981?You don't keep old TV guides in your basement? So many memories... Like trying to seduce the alien?m'alienThey are equally terribly awesome!!!i like that movie a lot but it still gives me nightmaresIts a stone cold groove.Man, Yaphet looks like a lost and quizzical Ninja Turtle-1 * -1 * -1 = -1The shit they're making it look like some 60s Barbarella shit or somethingIt that british rail alphabet?You know what is actually and interestingly on point?  All the human characters are looking at the ships AI computer in fear, whereas Ash, the android, dos not look too concerned."
"*Boom*Reminds me of this ABC Family Batman Begins commercial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSe6tvfedb0The sequel was better.  It's game over man, it's game over!ABC: Our ratings can't get any worse; we might as well try creating an event around something we had nothing to do with. Nothing left to lose...Totally nailed the leather jumpsuit James Bond space-disco vibe!Uhhh. What is that little gun Ripley is holding?  Never before has this been more relevant"
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdcOVjbP1TYThe TV commercial for Aliens freaked me out HARD when I was a little one...  just that creepy egg and the creepy tagline and the creepy ominous silence...  *shivers*ayy lmaoThe advert makes it seem like the movies about a space heist. First glimpse I thought it was Pam Grier.Alien, directed by Quentin TarantinoTom SkerritThe good days of sci fiBecause of Reddit, I mentally replaced on point with on fleek.  Damn you Reddit!Looks like a cover from the choose your own adventure series.Worst... poster... ever!  RIP MY BRAIN ENGLISH PLZI always thought Dallas looked a lot like my high school forensics teacher, which made me like the character a whole lot more because Mr. Cutelli was a really cool teacher.I love old TV Guide ads, weirdly nostalgic On the next episode of Mod Squad in Outer Space: Captain Greer's stomach ulcer inflames, with unexpected results.That Tom Skerrit is dead on thoughOoh, I like that zappy little ray gun. Ripley must've dropped that somewhere while running around the ship.The advert looks cheesy but at the same time it makes me want to watch it :)Needs more jones.I mean, I guess it's *true*how so?What a horrible advertisement for an amazing movie.[Gentlemen Broncos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfraN7E535U) style.  I don't remember her ever having a gun in the movie. Woah.. I had no Idea that Duane Dibley had left the Red Dwarf and hopped aboard the  Nostromo!  Is this an ad from the rolled-up porn mag that Ash tries to shove down Ripley's throat? ...buttstuff?I like the not so subtle sexualization of Ripley. Classic advertisement.I have watched this movie twice in the last week. The universe is telling me something....."
"Watch it again.(1)5 (1)6 23 42This is like those Choose Your Own Adventure book covers.  The '70s had its own medieval fairytales, and its own space opera future.  Full of disco and cocaine.*on FLEEKFoxy Brown is back and she's the meanest chick in space!Kinda lacks the punchiness of In Space, no-one can hear you screamWhen you've got nothing to lose, there's nothing you won't try."
"*ANAL*what's just as interesting as the ad is the fact that we used to get our tv guides either weekly or monthly in the newspaper or in the mail before we had the scrolling info channel.  that was cool back then,you could plan all your shows for a month on paper. umm..yeah..looks like a Sitcom advert. There were no guns on Nostromo.I love it!She never had a gunCould someone PLEASE pretty please explain the made-up tag line which feels like something for a judd apatow movie? Jennifer Aniston has... NOTHING TO LOSE... with Seth Rogan, Ving Rhames, and Russell BrandAlthough I like the ABC blurb, I don't understand why they didn't use In Space No One Can Hear You Scream. Why go to the trouble of getting someone to come up with a new line?When Parker looks like Miss J.Don't know about anyone else, but I can't wait for Neil blomkamps version of alien.perms on women... urgh!Ellen Ripley is by far and away the strongest and most alluring character of the last century. Alien is how I would characterize the boob structure of Ripley in this picture.it looks like they're holed up in a disco trying to fend off terrorists who've taken hostages and now I want to see that movie pleaseThe black guy appears to be going to his typical death...Why does Ripley have a pistol looking weapon?Because there were promo photos with them holding weapons."

"Here's the promo that ran before the Movie."
"https://youtu.be/rvCvgjrspr4?t=2m34sLooks like Star Wars and Scarface had a baby. Dead beat daddy Scarface walked out on momma Star Wars and little baby alien. Momma Star Wars got depressed, started self-medicating. First with mid shelf wine, then box wine,  and eventually made her way to bottom shelf brandy. One day momma Star Wars decides to go out with some of her bank teller coworkers/friends to a local disco. She goes out and buys a nice dress and heels, drinks a glass of brandy at her house before dropping little Alien off at her sisters house, the work-aholic 9-5 sister, Star Trek. She meets up with her friends at the disco and is immediately infatuated with this gyrating machine out on the dance floor. Mr machine sees Miss Star Wars all done up in her new dress and heels and her bright red lipstick. Mr Machine knows the type, single divorced mother looking for a fun night out. He approaches her and introduces himself... Hi I'm fever, Saturday Night Fever.... Fast forward a few months and Miss Star Wars is pregnant with, lo and behold, Fever's baby. They have been dating and hooking up regularly. At first, she doesn't know how to tell him, but eventually approaches him one night after they leave the disco... Fever I'm pregnant... all Fever can say is I shoulda known something was up when you wasn't drinking and dancing as much. Fever moves in and takes a liking to little Alien. Becomes sort of a father figure to her. Fever sticks around for the baby, but him and momma Star Wars never get married... Alien grows up completely idolizing Fever, listening to his BeeGees records and dancing in front of the mirror. In the meantime momma Star Wars drinking habit has come back with a vengeance. Fever's coke habit, which started recreationally during his dancing days, starts to really take a hold of him."
"On the other side of town, Scarface is fresh out. He did a 6 year bid for cocaine possession and intent to distribute. He's just lucky they didn't find his throwaway stuffed under his dash... He's trying his best to stay straight while still hanging around the same people and the same environment, after all it's all he knows. He hears through the grapevine about Star Wars and her problems. Turns out Fever owes a local dealer some money, both for drugs and a loan. Word on the street is this dealer plans on kidnapping little Alien for ransom if Fever doesn't pay out soon. While Scarface hasn't been a part of their life for years he feels he can't let this happen. He approaches the dealer with a proposition. Scarface is well respected in the neighborhood, the dealer knows who he is and the juice he carries. He agrees to let Fever make it, along with little Alien,  under one condition. Scarface has to do the dealer a favor. Theres a new up and coming pusher across town that's making noise. He's loud and flashy and supposedly has the money and guns to back it up. The dealer wants Scarface to take him out. It has to be in public the dealer says Somewhere where folks will see it go down. The dealer wants to let it be known that this is his neighborhood. Scarface feels like he has to agree, the dealer is young and brash but he's connected, he feels it's his only option to oblige. Scarface begins preparing. He recruits a guy who used to run with him. A Vietnam vet who's skilled in tactical hits. If it's going to be in public like the dealer wants, it has to be perfect."
"Well turns out the dealer across town takes his momma to market every Monday and Thursday. The streets are always packed this time of day. It's crowded enough for people to see and crowded enough for Scarface and his man to escape into the masses. They set it up and it goes down as planned. The neighborhood is shocked and everybody knows who was responsible for the hit... Scarface is just happy he doesn't have to worry about the dealer going after his child..."
"Well Fever, being the fucked up cokehead he is, gets in more trouble. Serious trouble. He gets throwed off one night and robs a liquor store with a few buddies. He gets caught and sentenced to two years. Scarface hears how torn up Star Wars is and how she's barely getting by. He decides to approach her. Explains he'd like to help anyway he can and wants to be a part of little Aliens life. Star Wars is at first apprehensive, she's heard what Scarface has been up to... Sure he's been staying low-key for the most part but the neighborhood talks... Despite this she agrees. Scarface becomes a regular visitor. He takes little Alien and even baby Space Balls to the park with him. Buys ice cream and the whole nine. Looks like Samuels from Alien: Isolation working the conputer on the left... Kinda freakyYou still don't understand what you're dealing with, do you? Perfect organism. Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility.My favorite is Barry Gibb on the left there stayin' alliii-hivvvve[Anal?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCKxZ81oDGQ)"
"Do I really need to tag this NSFW?Who the fuck reads TV guide[All I see, is Miss J on the right](https://s3.amazonaws.com/giphymedia/media/aUACY1m2UUrgQ/giphy.gif)Is this supposed to be authentic?  I just don't buy it."
"The tagline When you've got nothing to lose there's nothing you won't try just doesn't seem right.  Sure .. it's totally generic 80s ( .. almost _too much_, right?) but I just don't buy that they would choose that to advertise _this iconic movie_."
"It's not like these guys didn't know how to advertise movies, right?kill Jonesy. it's the only way to be sure."
"Adventure time??Am I the only one who missed the first time on television bit, thought this was a current TV guide, and read it to mean that NBC is so desperate for viewers they'll screen a 30-odd year old movie as a ratings grab?Yaphet Kotto-- Childish GAMBINO. [deleted]Oh, god, yes. For the first time in years, I'm actually going to schedule time to plant my ass on the couch and watch some shit.TIL people read paper version of the TV Guide.

I love whenever this guy's posts make it to the front page because I get a wild FOOD REPOSTER!!! tag inevitably linked to impossibly unoriginal content.Ayyy>when you've got nothing to lose there's nothing you want try."
"ANAL!"
"I mean alien...I'm really surprised that after all these years it's only *now* being shown for the first time on network T.V.  Strange they would advertise in T.V. Guide instead of the internet.    [deleted][deleted]Why?Is nobody going to add a Brazzers logo to that?"
"A 32-year-old British stuntwoman -- who is featured in the upcoming Star Wars movie -- is in a coma after a crash on Saturday on the set of Resident Evil: The Final Chapter.So sad. I hope she makes it. Stunt doubles deserve more recognition.Bigwig 1: how van we ensure that these films are bigger then The Dark Knight?"
"Bigwig 2:I have an ideaI can't tell if you're making a dad joke or are completely sincere.  Have an upvote anyway.No...no they don't.If only she had a name and OP put it in the title.Maybe beginning by putting her name in the tittle of the article. Seriously...Seems like she's getting enough recognition. I'm with you there. These men and women put their lives at risk and they don't get shit (outside of a few minor awards, if any). Would an awards category ever be possible for them?But... 99% of their job is about not getting recognized.They sure do"
"http://youtu.be/W9kQf_te2EAReading the article, it was through no fault of her own. All she was doing was riding a motorcycle without protective gear and there was a malfunction on the camera arm. That shit shouldn't have happened.Definitely. Stunt performers are the only people regularly putting their lives on the line in a production.Unless you count people driving home after a 22hr day.How about the post production crew? I am pretty sure the caffeine they take is above the safe limits. I was only just reading about her and her husband. They work together often and both did stunts for Fury Road. They both seemed so happy. Hoping for the best for them.Oh wow is that the couple that met during FR and got married?  Thats terrible ):Why is that terrible? People are allowed to fall in love and marry http://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/mad-max-fury-road/stunt-doubles-married/No, I checkedmet on FR and were married shortly after thatYeah. Hope he's taking the news well.Oh God, I hope not.How does it make any difference which stranger it is? You might as well be saying I just hope it happened to someone I haven't heard of.It reminds me of that Disneyland Gaston death a while back, when he set a firework off of his head. It was followed by comments on here like oh god I hope its not the one from the pushup videoYes, pretty sure they're the same coupleKinda just threw that out there not knowing huh.They aren't. I had this same thought when I read the title of this thread. The couple that got married from Mad Max is Dane and Dayna Grant. The injured stunt woman from the OP's article is Olivia Jackson. But..."
"In a statement on his Facebook page, Jackson's husband, David Grant -- also a stuntman -- wroteSame last name different people.  Dane and David aren't the same person. I just checked. Yikes that must have been a little confusing on set.Nope, I'm David and my brother is Dane. Two different people Count mine in with the thoughts and prayers of thousands upon thousands of Redditors that your wife realizes a full and speedy recovery.  She sounds truly amazing!!Their names are Dane and Dayna and they got married? I hope they don't use that as inspiration for any future kid's name.They'll name their kids Dayniel and DaynielleThat's awful. Stuntmen and women are so incredibly brave and are responsible for so much of what we enjoy in film. Still a shame that we don't honor them at the Oscars. Thoughts with her and her family.> Stuntmen and women are ~~so incredibly brave~~*well compensated thrill seekers.*"
"> Stuntmen and women are so incredibly brave"
"Hollywood stunt performers get paid good money to do something they love. That's hardly brave. >Stuntmen and women are so incredibly brave...."
"Nopel, they just do risky jobs which pay them their wages voluntarily.Careful with that edge breh ... And to do those risky jobs you have to be brave. Those are mentioned in their contracts which they voluntarily sign.That doesn't mean they aren't brave for what they do. You have to sign a contract to be in the military, police force, to be a fire fighter, etc. At this point I think you're just trying to make yourself out to sound like an idiot. Man, middle schools don't teach you anything...You've totally missed the point here. It's brave to be able to jump out of a plane. If I pay you to jump out of that plane it still takes bravery.>  If I pay you to jump out of that plane"
"I would not accept your money to do it. If I was an employee whose job was to do so, then I'd do it."
"I don't see where 'bravery' has come into this conversation. Well you're literally arguing against the dictionary definition of the word brave, so I really don't know what to tell you.I don't think bravery is the proper word here. Faith, balls to put it crudely, maybe courage, not bravery. Risking your life to save another is brave, not optionally choosing to jump a car or out of a plane.Well the definition of brave is to face and endure danger or pain, so I don't think it's the wrong word, but I do agree with you, it's probably not the one that I'd choose.So... brave.But wouldn't Tom Cruise win every year?Wasn't she the one that met her husband on Mad Max?Yes.  This is pretty sad."
"edit:  Apparently it's not the same stuntwoman.  Still very sad.The Oscars are about rich people giving awards to other rich people. I'm willing to wager that stunt women/men are not rich, on the whole. Ergo, not honored.I think it's because people want to imagine that actors do all their own stunts.Yeah hopefully she doesn't wake up to a zombie apocalypse"
"Or hopefully she doesYep, all the cool stuff we enjoy watching is usually the stunt people, not the actors/actresses.   I hope she has a speedy recovery.Shouldn't the stuntcrew as a collective get be recognized?Stunt coordinator should accept on behalf of the team. Yeah. From the article this just sounds like a freak accident."
"Here's hoping her recovery goes well.Apparently, the Academy's Board of Governors has voted down the proposal to create a category recognizing stunt performers every year from 1991 until at least 2012.how do you honor best stunt? Best looking stunt? In that case, you're honoring the director, choreographer, and many others. Most dangerous? Well, that's just kind of a silly thing to give an award for. Id think it would have to be based on technical criteria that laypeople wouldn't understand.You could make the same argument for wardrobe and special effects."
"Best one outfit? Best frame of the movie?"
"Just make it best stunts. That's it. Coordinator/choreographer accepts.Best innovation in stunt work probably. But then you'd just have to posthumously award then all to Yakima Canutt, then retire the category. It is tragic, but these sorts of accidents are exactly why we have stunt professionals.  They keep Milla Jovovich safe.To be fair, having an untrained actor performing the stunts would probably cause more harm for everyone. Are you saying Mila's safety isn't paramount?whats up with you and milla jovovichI just wish something was up between me and her :(The stunt woman was injured on a film starring Jovovich.I understand this, but your concern for her well being is a little intenseIt was meant to be a little tongue in cheek.  I would have responded with no less intensity were it Jonah Hill or Nicholas Cage (I might have been more intense if she had spared the one true god from harm).Don't worry man. I thought it was funny.edit: I fixed my wording because I realized some people were getting the idea that I'm against awarding stunt people, I could care less, I was just thinking of a counter-argument so we can actually have a discussion instead of just jerking off a one sided idea."
"The only thing is, giving them awards would possibly encourage the idea of stunt people attempting insanely dangerous things to get an award for it, which might not be the best idea in a line of work who's job is already to attempt really dangerous feats. This might be the dumbest thing I've read today. I'm not going into detail because it should be obvious.... And I'm on mobile...TOM CRUISE WINS Again for riding on a leash attached to the SPACE SHUTTLE while launching!"
"JACKIE CHAN wins lifetime award for jumping out of that shuttle WHILE IN ORBIT!"
"JASON STATHAM wins HUGS for Hijacking that Space shuttle and KICKING ASS in zero G![deleted]I couldn't care less that I accidentally forgot two letters. If they are adults and understand the risks, I don't see the problem. Besides, it's not like they are making stunts up on the fly, they would only do what is called for in the script. I don't think that's true any more than the misguided notion that teaching kids about safe sex encourages sex.That allegory doesn't even make sense in this context. It'd be more like if we rewarded kids for their sexual acts. Yes that could actually lead to kids having more sex and trying different ways to have sex."
"Your allegory would make sense if the debate was about whether or not we should teach stunt doubles new ways to do stunts. All you would have to do is alter the parameters of the award so as not to reward dangerous work, but specifically good work."
"As in, accurately recreating the caricature of their character during stunt work and so on.>I could care less"
"arrrgggghhhhInsightful [deleted]But could it possibly encourage stunts to be taken to more dangerous extremes in attempts to win awards? Don't reward them for what they've done. They might continue to do it. is your argument. Not at all. When you award someone for something, your awarding what they've done, they've accomplished something that the others in that category haven't. So in the stunt field that could mean awarding people for performing bigger and badder stunts, possibly encouraging the field of stunt work to be pushed in more dangerous directions. Again, I haven't even taken a side, I'm just presenting a counter argument. I don't know why everyone is getting so emotional about this. > Again, I haven't even taken a side, I'm just presenting a counter argument. I don't know why everyone is getting so emotional about this."
"There's nothing emotional about my statement. They're already doing the stunts, it's stupid not to reward them because you're afraid to encourage them. Could or couldn't care less?You're so right. While we're at it, we should stop giving petty awards to  astronauts because, why encourage their trivial antics?"
"Stunt people are given (mostly) meaningless rewards as a way of thanks for risking themselves in situations like have happened to this poor lady who happened to be a stunt driver for this movie we're currently talking about. Maybe we should find some way to shame them instead, you know, for having the nerve to risk their personal health for our entertainment?Oh but, who asked them?. Then why are you even here in the comments? Sometimes pushing an issue at the sake of trying to give your opinion weight while simultaneously making yourself seem petty and lame only reinforces said opinion."
"edit: also, I'm honestly laughing out loud at The only thing is, giving them awards would possibly encourage the idea of stunt people attempting insanely dangerous things to get an award for it, which might not be the best idea in a line of work who's job is already to attempt really dangerous feats.. Yeah. Let's boo and shame them for doing the stunts and acting in the manner that we requested and paid an honest salary for in a script vs paying 10 times a much for a team of CGI guys to do half as good a job for less work. Sounds good. Please guys, lets not encourage such tom foolery in the future.Who knows when a real person could outsource one of these honest machines out of a job for it and it's family?Well that's reasonableEven if it did, i don't see an issue with this.*Couldn't care lessCouldn't[deleted][deleted]Are we not going to go into the children! agruement?  If you start awarding those stunts would people assume children would then go on and try the stunts and get injured?I don't even know what you're trying to say."
"Were you trying to reply to something I said in that comment? Or did you accidentally reply to the wrong one? I'm lost Wasn't the argument about why stuntmen don't get awards?  I would assume someone would say If we gave stuntmen academy awards and showed such stunts on TV and how they did it, then kids would try to reenact these stunts and possibly injure/kill themselvesThe argument was just us discussing the possibilities of awarding stunt doubles."
"And I think that's a silly argument. Awarding stunt men can do no more harm to that idea of kids than what jackass has already irreparably done. More like directors and marketers would push for doing more dangerous/epic stunts, even when near the same effect could be obtained more safely, just to be able to say their movie won X award for stuntsmanship.There is no stunt Guy making all the decisions. In the film business everyone is a part of a department. There is an entire department of stunt people led by the stunt coordinator. I think people don't realize that everything in film is a team effort. Read the full credits next time you watch a movie, and then realize that there are even more people who worked on it that aren't even credited."
"Source: I am a motion picture mechanic(grip) in IATSEWhat the hell does the grip thing mean? Always confused me.they hold stuff."
"EDIT: somewhat more complicated than just holding stuff... but basically they hold stuff"
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grip_(job)A grip is basically the film business word for Stagehand. I am a member of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, officially titled as a Motion Picture Mechanic, but industry wide known as grips. A simple description is that grips are responsible for placing and securing safely any type of scenery, lighting, or camera position."
"If you look at the credits you will see three different Grip departments(in movies made in NYC - this is different than other places). Any Grip can(well, should be) able to do any of the tasks required in any of those three departments: Shooting Grips, Rigging Grips and Construction Grips."
"Shooting grips work on set during filming with both the camera and electric departments(and any other department that needs help) to shape and color the light with flags as well as working with the camera department by securing a camera position anywhere they want it, from rigging a camera to a lift way up in the air, to moving the dolly/crane that the camera is on(Dolly Grip), etc. Grips basically figure out how to do it and make it happen."
"Rigging Grips are what I like to call the special ops grips - they do the super elaborate stuff that needs to be setup(and removed) before or after filming. Rigging Grips usually do the car rigs(process trailers) and rigging lights in lifts. FWIW - I worked as a rigging grip on a TV show for seven years and I was never credited ever, not that I care, but it adds to my original point in this thread."
"Construction Grips literally build the set. The carpenters build the walls, scenery, etc. and the Grips take it from them and put it all together. It's like giant Legos. Construction Grips also are responsible for keeping the set clean of Construction debris and the carpentry shop in good working order."
"There is way more to Grips , but I hope this helps you get a picture of wha we do Hola fellow 52 grip brethren. To sum up our jobs, we do all the things people see but no one really knows what the hell it is we do. Most of the general public think we're boom ops. Wassup brotha! Maybe I know you! I'm a Johnson Did you do rigging on Power 1st season? That's the only Johnson that comes to mind. I'm probably the only member in the union with a country as a last name. The directors and writers are just as likely to write in big stunts to try and win the award. Being able to say winner of X stuntman award would be great marketing.except in John WickNo it wouldnt. Its not a stunt persons job to do something dangerous, its to make it *look* dangerous. When stuff goes bad its because something went very wrong. It has little to nothing to do with the actual stunt performance, (most of the time). A group of professionals wouldnt give an award for taking stupid risks.>When stuff goes bad its because something went very wrong. It has little to nothing to do with the actual stunt performance"
"Exactly the case here. Jackson was riding a motorcycle at high speeds without a helmet or protective gear and the camera was in front of her attached to a metal arm which was supposed to rise up but malfunctioned and didn't, so she ran right into it."
"She did everything correctly. It was completely out of her control and had nothing to do with the stunt.Well it did have to do with the stunt, just not the stunt woman's fault.... But it is a stuntperson's job to do dangerous things. You're nuts if you think stunts aren't still dangerous, even with all the safety precautions in the world.Dangerous is a relative term. The inherited risk is different for different people. One stuntman's job might be safer in comparison than a truck driver's route in Alaska, or a police officer's job in Compton, or a sanitation worker in NYC.I guess reckless wouldve been a better word i was looking for. Doing a prat fall is somewhat dangerous. Doing so without proper training is reckless."
"Stunt people are professionals, and yes what they do is dangerous. But it isnt reckless in the sense that they perform stunts with no care for their well being. They take precautions to ensure the safety of the crew and the stunt people. Theyre professionals who know what risks to take and how to reduce the danger."
"If they behaved recklessly then they wouldnt be insurable.I don't necessarily think it encourages anything, aside from children (who typically are taught not to engage in these activities by parents, teachers, law enforcement, etc.). They're not really the target demographic for the Oscars anyway."
"It may inspire those interested to train (as there is actually stunt training) and learn more, but most adults wouldn't just flippantly attempt their own stunts (aside from the Steve-o's and Knoxville's of the world, but that's another story)."
"Plus, to say that is to say most sports, martial arts / MMA, pro-wrestling, circuses, and most forms of entertainment encourage dangerous behavior. I think if your apt to learn those sorts of skills, you'll find a means eventually."
"Actually never realized stunt work wasn't an (untelevised) Oscar category, but definitely think it should be.It's no different than pro snowboarding, skating, skiing, etc. Progression is the name of the game.Yep, just look at the sort of shit the Nitro Circus crew get up to. A guy recently landed a triple backflip on a dirt bike. People like that are constantly pushing the limits of what's possible.Couldn't..... It's couldn't care less.....I don't think so, any more than actors who fluctuate their weight drastically for roles (SUPER unhealthy) encourage other actors to do the same just because.  If the stunts become more dangerous, that's the fault of the director and writer for making them so.But, do they give an award specifically for weight change? If not I don't see the comparisonI doubt they'd award them on danger but would do so on execution.Well the counter argument can be made that while it's unhealthy for an actor to fluctuate weight so much, it's easier for a doctor to keep an eye on them and to really let them know what their physical limit is."
"Rob mcheleny gained a lot of weight for its always sunny and his doctor told him to stop because it was getting really bad."
"Whereas on set for a stunt take, any number of things can spontaneously go wrong, it's less controlled than weight. Stunts are SUPER controlled and usually very safe.  It might not look like it, but the stunt actors are usually wearing harnesses and pads, falling onto soft surfaces and they've been trained in how to do these things very safely.  There are networks of stunt workers that share information and tips and have safety checks.  There are usually EMTs on site whenever a stunt is happening, just in case.  There are the odd accidents, but they are now few and far between, considering how many action movies with amazing stunts are released each year.Haven't heard of an actor going into a coma from dieting.I work on film sets, I'm aware of how they're ran, but there are still so many variables we can't control no matter what we do. More so than weight gain. Especially when you're dealing with pyrotechnics, cables, and just plain old human folly being the biggest thing that causes trouble even on the most controlled set. Yeah, but this guy is 15 and has watched a making of or two..."
"So you best shut up and take notes."
"*Obviously* the risk of personal injury and long term health issues are equal between actors and stuntpersons."
"Slash essssss. (/s)Sarcasm much?I've actually worked with stunt teams being that it's fairly close to my career of choice, but okay.> Rob McElhenney cultivated mass"
"FTFY"
"Stop cultivating and start harvesting! TRY TO MOVE ME BRO!! GET A RUNNING START!You guys need to start greasing up some dudes or I'm going to freak out!They have their own awards ceremony. It's called the Taurus Awards- http://www.taurusworldstuntawards.comThat award show you haven't heard of until 2 seconds ago.They should have a category at the Academy AwardsWhat about stunt butts? They deserve a slap on the back too.They'd probably reason that it would distract from the real actors or something.  It's sort of dickish, but also makes a bit of sense since part of a stuntperson's job is to blend in."
"? You have a lot of technical awards at the academy alreadyThe Screen Actor's Guild recognizes stunt ensembles. Only recently though, it'll take a bit before the Academy adds it too. Kind of just needs someone advocating for recognizing stunt performers. Pretty sure something like a Tom Cruise/Jennifer Lawrence advocacy for the category would get it done rather quickly.I mean to be fair, Actors are suppose to blend in, into whatever role they are playing. I think that justification would be laugh worthy at best. There really isn't a reason not to, I mean (and please correct me if I'm wrong because I don't watch them like that) doesn't the Academy Awards also cover musical scores?Jason Statham is actually a huge proponent of it. There are a few actors that also support as well, but he is the most vocal. (He might do it because it's his best chance at winning one)Because 90% of his movies aren't actually him. Either you don't know what, proponent means, or you used, aren't when you meant, are."
"Not sure which. You don't have to put a comma in front of quotation marks.You don't have to put kittens in front of trains, but that doesn't stop some people.Those commas doe. Y'all jelly of my comma game."
"Also, English is stupid. Nobody knows what commas do anymore, they're just miracle pauses. The second comma should be a period.It's like a homicide.While filming Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Daniel Radcliffe's stunt double,  David Holmes, suffered an accident and became paralyzed. It happened while he was rehearsing a flying scene, he was hurled into a wall, breaking his neck, and leaving him paralyzed from the chest down.What it really comes down to is that the safety conditions on scenes are not optimized fort he stunt professionals. I heard of whole teams quiting a movie set because the director & producer wasn't providing them the protection they needed.Hmm..Didn't see him hugging it out at the *Deathly Hallows* premiere."
"Maybe. [ This source](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/real-life-stories/harry-potter-stuntman-david-holmes-3279214) I checked to get some of the details said:"
"> David was rushed to the local Watford General Hospital but transferred to the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in Stanmore, North West London, where doctors told him he would be paralysed from the chest down, with only limited movement in his arms and hands.I really love how Daniel and him are good friends and still hang out.Are they?Well he, Daniel and various others connected to them say so. It may surprise you to know that the Harry Potter cast are all good friends not just with each other, but with the entire production team as well. They did all spend the better part of 10 years all together working on 8 films. IIRC, Dan, Rupert and Emma are very good friends with the hair and makeup team. Oh yeah if they were using the same people for the whole time i'd be surprised if they werent friends, but i just didnt know that.[PHOTO](http://i.imgur.com/qLitLa5.jpg)"

It's mostly all outsourced. What's so bad about it? Isn't it your job or is there something I'm missing here?I was mostly kidding.I liked em, except the last one.  It had no story, recycled enemies and environments (I get it's part of the story, but still), and the completely butchered existing characters instead of making new ones.  It's the only movie where I've ever thought That's it? at the end.

All of it was hilariously bad. By far some of the funniest action choreography I've ever seen, it's like they didn't even try.just because it was shit doesnt mean it wasnt enjoyable.I think most people liked the FPS scene, mostly because it's one of the only cases in video game movies I can think of where it suddenly becomes clear the director just wanted to add something that doesn't fit in to the movie format, but it would just be an awesome homage to the source material."
"It was the sort of thing you'd find as a fan made video on Youtube, but with a big budget and shoved in to a movie. It made no sense as part of a movie, but I forgive it because the movie was shit anyway, so it became the greatest part of the film.Final Fantasy MCMXLVIFFWW2People always make fun of how many Final Fantasys there are but I've never played one that wasn't a good game. Not many series can claim that. The unsung heroes of Hollywood."
"Are there any decent films about stuntmen, other than Hot Rod which is great but really the style I'd be interested in? I bet there's a lot of good stories waiting to be told.My martial arts coach was the stunt double for Jet Li during The Expendables franchise. There was an explosion on the set while they were filming on a boat. His friend died, and my coach's leg was critically injured. I haven't seen him in a while so I'm not sure if his leg is fine now. http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/expendables-2-stuntman-sues-injuries-395720"
"He was also part of the choreography team for Avengers, Iron Man, and the sequels for Iron Man. He quit his role for Ant-Man after they changed the directors.Unsung heroes?  You're thinking of the brave young men and women who protect your country, or Doctors Without Borders, or even photographers who risk their lives to bring the rest of the world photos and videos of the atrocities going on in the world."
"Stuntpeople are many things but heroes, they certainly are not.I said 'of Hollywood'. No one's putting them up there with soldiers. Jesus. Don't be a tard.Backyard Stunting: Hits and MissesDeathproof also had stunt women as the leads and their characters professions were stunt women.Looney Tunes: Back in Action. Brendan Fraiser plays Brendan Fraiser's stuntman before then teaming up with Bugs Bunny and a Hollywood executive to save the world from an evil corporation. I've yet to see it, but I here The Stunt Man with Peter O'Toole is good.[**Hooper \(1978\) with Burt Reynolds.**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077696/?ref_=nv_sr_3)  Probably not what you wanted but I remember thinking this might be a cool movie when I was a kid.,  Never did see it.Check out [The Fall](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460791/).Seriously. It's one of the best-looking movies I've ever seen."
"I'm writing a film actually titled *Stuntman* (clever right?) about a near-retirement stuntman living in the shadow of a legendary action movie star (not a real one, but someone based on the likes of Bruce Willis or Tom Cruise)."
"Focuses on the drama and flaws of the main character, stemming from a profession with high risks and almost no rewards."
"Also a great opportunity to throw out facts about what stunt professionals have to go through in the business, and what little credit or recognition they get for putting their life on the line day to day.Sounds awesome, would love to see that made!Sounds coolSo The Wrestler, but with cars?I wouldn't say that stunt performers get almost no rewards.  My best friend does stunts for film and TV and he's made almost $500,000 in the span of two years.I wanted to be a stunt person as a teenager, and had no idea how to pursue it. I wish now  I'd tried harder.My buddy didn't get started until he was 25 and his career really didn't start until he was 29.  It's never too late.  There are jobs that require less training, like riggers (the people in charge of the set-up of stunts, making sure pads and mats are properly placed and lines are secured) and pullers (literally the people who yank the lines to pull actors back or up).Neat :)Jesus really? That's insanely good money. I'd consider doing that for that kind of money. Any info from your friend about how he started and how much he works would be Great if you don't mind?We went to school together for acting.  In school, we had a stunt performing class.  It showed us the basics like how to rehearse at half-speed, safety measures, our right to refuse unsafe work, and proper ways to take falls/hits as well as some basic weapon handling (hand guns, rifles, rapier, broad sword and dagger)."
"Our instructor, who is also a working stunt coordinator, really liked my buddy worked and offered to train him further once we graduated.  Through there, he got gigs, joined the union and made connections.  The stunt world is very, very close knit in the sense that once you get associated with a coordinator, you're pretty much set.  They like working with the same people, so you get consistent work until you work on a bigger project and a bigger coordinator sees you and brings you on as one of their guys.  And you climb up the ladder that way."
"It's great money, but since taking it seriously, my roommate trains about 8 hours a day between working out and classes.  He's done SWAT-style certification for weapon handling and tactics, he's top-tiered in several martial arts, and is always taking new classes, learning new skills.  We live together and he's pretty much always has a weapon in his hand running drills and that's why he's excelled so quickly."
"He goes through waves of work.  He just wrapped on Suicide Squad and he'll be starting up doubling the leads on two fairly popular sci-fi shows, but then he'll do nothing until shoot season starts up again in April/May. Wow he works his ass off it sounds like. At least he is actually learning skills though. Thanks for all the info man. Just wondering what do you do now?He definitely earns his pay cheque.  When he's on set, he's usually on for 11 or so hours and has more than one serious injury.  He's completed a six day contract with a cracked rib after the second day.  Stunt guys are infamous for not reporting their injuries, especially if they happen on set."
"I work as a freelancer in film and TV.  Kind of a jack of all trades.  I still act from time to time, but mostly in stuff I'm self-producing or stuff my friends are making.  The casting scene in Toronto is pretty shit with most casting agents just trying to cast clones of attractive leads from already successful American shows."
"On set I'm usually on the AD team (assistant director) or on the camera team (usually assistant camera, but sometimes DoP on smaller shoots).  I also have an editing and visual effects background, so I do freelance post production work.  A bulk of my income comes from that.[Like this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTmuVRCJmv0)Ha!

It'll be out in November, starring Tom Cruise *and* Bruce Willis.This is the first time I've ever seen an internet person describe their script and I actually think to myself wow that actually has A LOT of potential.

It would be read Risk Over Reward and would have a catchy title and look good on a poster while also alluding to a deeper meaning within.*Drive* was about a stuntman, sort of...Tarantino's Death Proof.

But doesn't that mean the brain is dealing with some damage and they can only hope it heals now?  I know nothing about it but brain damage is bad. People are also put into comas if they have very painful injuries, like severe burns. Yeah, people don't seem to realize there is a pretty big difference. Still shitty either way.Michael Schumacher and Jules Bianchi were both in induced comas. Just because it's induced doesn't mean anything either bad nor good. This is how I find out there is a new Resident Evil coming out.This saddens me. I hope she pulls through alright.Oh my God, that's awful."

Underworld 5 is coming out next october.IIRC they have been progressively more and more profitable. No point in stopping as long as they make money. This is the 6th and supposedly last one, hence the title. There's Resident Evil, Resident Evil: Apocalypse, Resident Evil: Extinction, Resident Evil: Afterlife, and Resident Evil: Retribution(came out in 2012). Retribution left it on a cliffhanger, so they kind of needed to do at least one more.I wish they kept going to the original 7 or keep going. >hence the title"
"Just like *Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter* was absolutely the last one...The only truly *bad* one is Afterlife. Though the CGI in Extinction is bloody awful.As a resident evil fan, I can confidently say they are all awful, because all of them feature Alicethey are all bad, don't kid yourself. this series could have been amazing. considering the love for the walking dead, the blew a great chance at something amazing As much as I'm tired of reboots, this franchise is really needs one. With better actors and characters who looks more like their originals and not like some cheap cosplayers for some local videogames convention."
"I mean, [this is Leon](http://images.wikia.com/residentevil/images/c/c5/Resident_Evil_Retribution_-_Copy.jpg)? [Claire and Chris](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111119495/3248603-chris_redfield_movie.jpg)? Seriosly?! I liked Jill and Carlos from the second movie, but after that it was a complete miscast. Like they didn't even try.I actually like Chris. Claire could have been a bit daintier looking, but I didn't mind her too much either."
"They butchered Leon though... I love RE but thinking about how they destroyed my favorite character makes me cringe.... Chris doesn't actually look bad, but yeah.  The worst part about Leon is they made him into a little bitch who was completely hung up on Ada.  Which, yeah, there was something in RE2 and 4, but not to the point where he was pretty much useless. because they don't try. its more contract obligation at this point ... Leon was in this series...? I... really don't remember him.He was in the 5th one. I loved the 5th one so much it is my favorite one. I use the theme music for my ringtoneAlright, come on now, Claire and Chris don't look half badThe only truly *good* one is the first"
"....but God dammit if I don't keep watching the hell out of them! They're super fun. Even if I'm just waiting for the inevitable reboot that makes them make sense to the games. Yeah the first one is awesome. Apocalypse was good, and after that they're ok. Afterlife is honestly boring though. Afterlife was alright. The one where they're in the desert is the bad one. look at me using my powers to control fire. oh no, im not using my powers to save my friendsIt's too bad about Extinction's CG. It had one of the better concepts of all of them. Even if they were robbed completely from Day of the Dead. Also, I like the setting. That's funny because I've watched all of them, and Extinction is the only one I don't really remember...Is that the one where no powers Alice uses her powers anyway?  Cause fuck that one. I liked Afterlife mainly because we got Chris Refield and evil Wesker, but yeah Extinction's CGI wasn't the best. I love how in Retribution they're just like, Fuck it. Let's bring everybody back to life/introduce everybody from the games. I think if the new one is more like Retribution than the previous ones it'll be good. Only thing I didn't like is they essentially copy and pasted the fight scene between Wesker and chris from resident evil 5(the game) into the movie and even had the executioner from the same gameas long as they dont shoe horn in Sheva and Rebbeca and kill them off, it'll be find my me. actually i dont even care. this just isn't resident evil. this is just something for the director's wife to do.Yeah. It pissed me off that they killed Leon off screen at the beginning of Apocalypse so it was nice to see him alive in the last one, even if it was odd.I totally missed this. When did he die off screen?Jill is suspended at the beginning of Apocalypse because a fuck up she makes gets Leon killed."
"yeah..Wow really? Out of all the movies (minus the newest one and CG ones) that was my favourite because it had to the most to do with RE...I never realized Leon is dead in it...now I'm sadWhat happens to the footage of on-set accidents? Is it kept as evidence or destroyed out of good taste?Taken as evidence. It is never destroyed. And in some cases, the moment of injury has been used in the movie (a famous case of a Chuck Norris movie where a stuntman was nearly killed when a piece of an exploding door flew into his head... and was left in the movie).you can see the video of the two kids and the main actor getting killed in the twilight movie."
"Edit: I mean in a clip, not the actual movie. You mean the two kids and the lead actor of the scene... they SHOULD have used stunt people for that scene but didn't. And it's not in the movie so... No shit it isn't used, I'm just saying you can view the footage online. Twilight Zone movie.*There's been several instances of footage of someone dying in a stunt has made it into the final film.  I want to say XXX and Transformers 4 did but I'm not *entirely* positive.  Some people might think it's in poor taste but I imagine some stunt-people feel that it would be a dishonor to their work to not show what they died for.  The movie [Shark!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark!_(film) featured a promo in which the stunt man was attacked a killed by a shark during production.Such a great and respectful career that goes unnoticed many times. They should seriously recieve much more recognition than they currently do.A lot of comments here that are just very poor taste. Can we not make every single little thing a really bad attempt at a joke for once?But it's how humans cope with le misery amirite fellow redditors? /sDamn :("
"Motorcycle crash with no gear is always no bueno. Whenever I see motorcycle scenes in movies I get scared for the stuntpeople."
"Godspeed.For the lazy: Her name is Olivia Jackson, and she was in Dredd, Gaurdians of the Galaxy, Age of Ultron and Fury Road."
"I wish stunt people got more recognition. I remember there was a post a few weeks back of stars with their stunt people, and none of the stunt people's names were listed. Thats a really bad ass set of films to be a part of Serious question: do stunt doubles get paid well and (more of the American side) do they get great health benefits? So sad to hear this. I remember reading that she met her husband on the set of mad max, can't imagine what he is going through right now. Because of the scene she wasn't wearing a helmet??"
"In this era of CGI there is no excuse for that shortcut any longer. Because matrix 3"
"Cgi may be good, but it can only go so far.In fact they can go far further that. Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL6hp8BKB24)  to understand how far cgi has come. I have seen the error in my ways sir"
"Touchesame, I was blown away by how much it's used now. you're using a movie from a dozen years ago as the example of CGI capability?I don't agree."
"In this day and age all equipment should be tested properly to not fail."
"She was riding in a straight like and a camera boom 'malfunctioned'>In this day and age all equipment should be tested properly to not fail."
"They are, but catastrophic failures happen eventually. Murphy's Law etc."
"Just look at that airplane that had its engine blown recently: it was tested properly, but some unimaginably rare set of circumstances caused it to explode.> In this day and age all equipment should be tested properly to not fail."
"That'd be nice, but there's always something you can fail to account for.It seems they should fund & use that new inflatable helmet design. I can't remember how it looks, but it goes around the neck & inflates over your head when you crash."
"Ah, [found it](https://youtu.be/oSOhZQU4rZ8?t=51). It is much bigger than i remember, but it should be a lot easier to hide with CGI than an actual helmet & can possible blend in with the right outfit.TL;DR:"
"> There is a metal arm, which carries the camera along. But it malfunctioned and didn't lift up. It was totally out of her control. She had no chance.Massive respect to her and everyone in her field. Hoping she comes out okay.My thoughts are with this awesome lady and her husbandToo young. Hope she survives. Stuntmen and stuntwomen are really underappreciated.  They take the biggest risks, but get none of the credit.  It really sucks.Thats horrible :(  Hope she pulls through!I really feel for her husband, who rushed to join her as soon as he heard.   Terrible accident.  Terrible.That's sucks that she got hurt. Feels to her family. But hey.....RE6 is finally happening. Those movies are a guilty pleasure for me.I like them as well except the last one that was a bit crazy for me but il watch the next one just because I've seen the others I thought the point of a stunt person was because it could cost millions if a famous actor broke a wrist or sprained an ankle so its just risk mitigation. They use stuntmen to reduce the risk for everyone (stuntmen are trained, actors not so much) and so they don't have to reshoot an entire movie if an actor is injured to the point of being unable to do their job.That, and then there's the fact that the actors may not actually be physically able to or brave enough to do whatever stunt it is.unless you're tom cruise Or Jackie Chan (Who was a stuntman first).Imagine dying for such a shit film.[deleted]Soo...she should be fine? I hope so.Not guaranteed, induced coma's are not reliable."
"See Michael Schumacher and Jules Bianchi from recent memory who were both kept in induced comas for extended periods."
"Schumacher is **severely** handicapped physically and mentally after coming out of his and Jules died."
"Scary..."
"Hope she pulls through.An induced coma doesn't make it any less severe.  It sounds like she had severe brain trauma and they induced a coma to prevent active seizures from the massive swelling.  There is no telling yet what kind of lasting effects she might have.[deleted]It is no different from a coma. It is a coma. That's why it has the word coma in it.> It is no different from a coma."
"Yes it is. An induced coma is a temporary coma done using barbiturate drugs and is not a natural state. It is done to protect the brain and/or for major neural surgery. It's a type of coma. It's like saying a bass guitar is not a guitar just because it's different from an electric guitar.> It is no different from a coma."
"But it is. The process is completely different. Here is a quote from wikipedia;"
"> Typically, a distinction is made in the medical community between a coma and a medically induced coma, the former is generally understood to be a result of circumstances beyond the control of the medical community, while the latter is generally understood to be a means by which medical professionals may allow a patient's injuries to heal in a controlled environment.Still think it's like referring to a guitar and a bass. Yeah, when someone says guitar they usually mean electric but that doesn't mean a bass isn't a guitar.> Nice clickbait title."
"That's what's disagreeable. This is a very serious injury, and semantics aren't separating any truth from the title. This title isn't clickbait. You're not wrong, you just come off as a dick saying shit like that. A clickbait article would be: You'll never believe what Star Wars cast member is in a coma!This is one of the unfortunate realities of practical effects. I, like just about everyone else on this subreddit, always push for practical effects over CGI, but I seem to forget that a person's life is likely on the line during some of these stunts. I hope she is able to recover in time to see Episode 7 on opening day.Damn.This kind of injury usually doesn't lead to good things... damn.wait wasnt there also a large accident (collapsing ramp or so) on the last Resident Evil movie? With a large number of people injured I believe.Genuine question: Who'll be liable for her death? I'll go with the jib operator."
"I guess that is one risk of the anti-CGI trend - more realism = more stunt persons risking their lives for a movie.Prediction: This will be the last RE movie. *Coming to theaters next Summer:* **Resident Evil: The NEW Chapter**Her [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3960276/) for anyone looking or wondering.We should send like a giant /r/movies get well soon card. We love Mad Max: Fury Road enough. I got confused by the article picture. It makes it seem like Olivia Jackson is the stunt double for Charlize Theron (Furiosa) in Fury Road but according to my research, she was actually the stunt double for Rosie Huntington-Whiteley who plays one of Immortan Joe's wives."
"DAE get a little fucked up from the picture too?One of my buddies dad is a stunt double and these people are seriously badass. Very under-appreciated. Hoping she pulls through and has a good recovery :(That sucks... [Some gave all...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydWhRObVxrM) **FTA:** *There is a metal arm, which carries the camera along. But it malfunctioned and didn't lift up. It was totally out of her control. She had no chance.*"
"Trying to picture the scene/layout. What was happening with the camera arm that she couldn't avoid it or fall to the ground? Anyone?Damn, hope she gets better. Stunt doubles always take the fall and no one notices."
"Best wishes to her.The unsung heroes of film. I hope she pulls through okay.That stinks. But adventure is adventurous for a reasonDidn't a bunch of people get hurt on the set of the last resident evil movie as well?[Not the first time something's gone wrong on a Resident Evil set.](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/resident-evil-5-platform-collapse-246632)and?????damn, this puts a big damper on the resident evil movie..Something similar happened on the set of resident evil retribution. 16 people were sent to the hospital"
"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1855325/trivia?item=tr2197053Wait... Is this the same stuntwoman who doubled for Theron and met her husband on Mad Max, who doubled for Hardy?Nope.final chapterDoes she have a metal horn stuck in her head that grows after doing evil things?wait wait wait. theyre making another resident evil movie? do people still watch this abomination?For a Resident Evil movie aswell thats awfull ..Why don't CGI departments just focus on making rag doll CGI humans so much more realistic.resident evil has a history of injuries on set Damn and in such a shit movieOh god another shitty RE movie. Yay."
"Still hopefully she ends up pulling through. Damn.Cue the angry we should only be able to use cgi! Stunt people's lives matter! Story I don't know what's more sad, an innocent person in a coma or the fact that a new resident evil movie is coming out.Of all the movies to get highly injured in (and possibly die), she does it for THOSE turds?Resident Evil movies put me in a coma too."
"(Hoping she does fine. Levity to combat gravity. =) )Sending her the best of wishes and hoping she pulls through. Stunt people are amazing in what they can do!omg..... they can find a way to plug Star Wars in everything!"
"jesus christWonder if they can apply for insurance due to an injury and get shit ton of money like how athletes canSo, we only care because she's in the next *Star Wars*?That's what I'm getting out of this. I mean, it's good we care, people don't tend to care about stuntpeople, but it seems strange that the Star Wars connection is made explicit. Not really. I don't think anyone cares about the star wars part. It is simply to explain who she is. I hope she wakes up ok."
"Side note: Why the fuck are they making another Resident Evil movie? The Guardian's headline for this read: *Star Wars Stuntwoman in Coma After Film Set Crash.*"
"Nothing incorrect about that, but it's misleading as hell.Well it is resident evil, so I'm almost certain that it is not actually the final chapter.[deleted]Posts are upvoted on the grounds they deserve to be seen.Another Resident Evil movie? I'm pretty sure that is the sign of Anti-Christ coming.Fuck, I think this is the couple who met on the set of fury roadDanny Trejo, one of the most bad ass actors in Hollywood, thinks actors who do their own stunts are foolish and has a lot of respect for his stunt man."
"http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/04/11/bad-ass-danny-trejo-actors-who-do-their-own-stunts-are-idiots/ Man, that really sucks to risk your life for a Resident Evil movie...Her name is Roberta paulsonThe Resident Evil movies have been putting people in coma's for years, you ever try to sit through the whole thing?They are still making Resident Evil movies?They're still making resident evils?Wasnt a very dangerous stunt ,yes, beside the high speed and no Helmet or whatsoever its pretty much saveI think they're talking relative to the other insane shit she presumably has pulled off in other stunts. It maybe wasn't *that* dangerous in the context of stunt work. Or at least wouldn't have been, had that arm not malfunctioned.It absolutely sucks to hear this. There seems to be a lot of accidents occurring with these Resident Evil movies. There was the huge set collapse when they were filming *Retribution* a few years back, and now this. Something is certainly overlooked somewhere during production. I'm sure the insurance company is looking into it at this point.TIL there is a new resident evil. Hopefully this won't be her final chapter.I bet she didn't have a med-pac with herResident Evil: Final DestinationHope she recovers, though its not really a surprise. Don't see many news stories of electricians getting electrocuted> It wasn't a very dangerous stunt, a source told The Sun."
"Clearly it's very dangerous because she's now in a coma.Someone can go into a coma from a scene where 2 actors are sitting down talking in a room if something goes wrong. I guess you could say its her final chapter. So it's her final chapter Hasn't the Resident Evil series done enough damage?  At least it was the final chapterWhat a terrible thing to happen. I wish her well and hopefully she recovers."
"Nobody deserves to die making a resident evil movie...She met her fiance/husband? on the Fury Road set.  He was a stuntman as well.  Remember reading an article about it on here right after the movie came out.  Different stunt woman. What a shit movie franchise to die for In all fairness, her job regardless of the quality of the movie is always badass.  No matter how crappy the movie I'm sure it's a pleasure for her to do crazy stunts I'm sure being in the movie business must have something to do with it, there's other ways to get paid doing dangerous physical activity What, like hooking in a bad neighbourhood?Like by being a sky diving  instructor, or a stunt pilot More danger, less pay iircMaybe it was the only way to get out of being in that movie.Damnit Resident Evil, after games you're ruining peoples lives now?It's a shame, I hope she makes it through this, shouldn't she be protected regardless of how simple the shot might be?"
"...And how on earth did they get enough money to make another crappy Resident Evil movie, who gave another greenlight to this awful franchise?They last one was awful, but I enjoyed the rest of them.  The new one is the conclusion, so there probably won't be any more after that. I liked the first one, I know the second tried sticking to the story, but then it went and strayed off the games storyline...I didn't bother watching Resident Evil 3: Mad Max goes to Vegas, or any others after that.They may be shitty movies but they make money so they keep making them.Terrible to hear, but I think we can all agree that this being The Final Chapter is great news.Really? Another Resident Evil!? That's such a shitty movie to possibly die in the process of making.I'm just excited to find out that there's a new Resident Evil coming out.yeah, that happens to people who do dangerous thingsBy that logic you will live literally forever.Hope she makes it so she can see the mooooovieThats so sad I remember reading about how she met her husband while filming Mad Max. :( And the Resident Evil film franchise claims another innocent life.Holy Fuck Yes!!!! A new resident evil movie!Just one of the millions of reasons why they should STOP making Resident Evil moviesI think this is a sign that they need to stop making Resident Evil movies. This is the universe telling you STOP, guys.Guess you could say that was... [Her last chapter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YMPAH67f4o)"
"#IamgoingtohellforthisThis is just terrible. I can't believe they are making another resident evil movie. Hoping for a speedy recovery, wasn't she the one that met her husband during the Mad Max Fury Road movie?Am I supposed to feel twice as bad for her because it happened in the set of a Resident Evil movie? Because I feel twice as bad for her because of that."
"What does a person see or feel while in a comaWait they are making another resident evil movie ?The Resident Evil films are absolutely terrible for this.  They cut through a bunch of extras and ended about three stunt performer careers during their time shooting in Toronto.  They just pay their fines and move on.  Absolutely no regard for their well-being and it doesn't help our union is utter shit as well.The worst part is you know RE's gonna be a shit movie.Would this really have been posted if she wasn't associated with Star Wars?Prayers...It wasn't a very dangerous stuntWell, that's another reason to hate these look at my wife, she's still crazy hot right? pleas. I mean,  movies.Well I guess that's her *Final* *Chapter*"
"^^^^^I ^^^^^am ^^^^^not ^^^^^a ^^^^^good ^^^^^person.Shame she had to meet her demise on such a shit film.Well, she made a choice to be in an awful movie like that, what goes around comes around. You are a miserable piece of shit. Go fuck yourself, you cunt. I don't actually feel that way fyi, I just like to make horrible jokes about horrible things happeningJokes are meant to be funny, fuckwit. You're just an asshole. Downvote this /r/shitpost through the Earth's core, folksSo you failed at your job, and now are receiving more publicity than from failed than a doing your job successfully? Nice workLearn to string a sentence together, you fucking shitstain. The world does not cater to losers.   Nature selectionAsshole. Only so many chiefs allowed, we need more monkeys like ulol ripA woman in a coma and you use that time to promote 2 movies... I hate this world sometimes.is this the woman that got married to a stunt guy in fury road while filming?Nope that was a different stunt woman.I'm starting to think that stunt people should have co-billing with the actors that they performed the stunts for, they need to start getting more recognition for the risks they take."
"Edit: I guess people don't like the idea of people getting better recognition for their work, say some lines, yeah get credit. Risk your life? No fucking way man.Just another reason those shitty movies should stop.Of all the movies to stake your life on and potentially lose it...  it had to be this one.At least one person is going to believe that movie title. [deleted]We all know they'll never stop making Resident Evil movies but at least to this actress this will be the last. They're making another resident evil, ugh, they're just getting ridiculous. Despite the low budget and cheesy effects I liked the first one, and the next two were ok, but after that it's like they were trying to the movies look like live action videogame cut scenes.(and not from the good games either)Can we start a gofuckme funding aid so they can stop making these stupid movies?"
"We get it director! You are married to the star!Lots of people love these movies you pretentious twit. They aren't cinematic masterpieces, but they're enjoyable, entertaining movies for fans of the franchise. I was a RE fan before you even heard of what it was!!"
"First time played it on Saturn, then PSX, then it got fucked into a movie!It wasn't a very dangerous stunt. But shes in a coma... What a bummer, i remember reading how she met her husband on the set of Mad Max.Induced comaThat's better? Just really felt they were downplaying the severity of what happened. It is better. Induced comas are controlled by doctors. They can still be dangerous but the doctors can wake her up when they think shes strong enough.You're thinking of Dayna Grant, this is not her.A Resident Evil movie?"
"Not worth it. Residents evil needs to stop making movies they getting worse and worseThe Final Chapter...thank god.Resident evil is *finally* ending? Depends on how much money it pulls in.  A single stuntwoman's not going to stop it if it makes money.yeah she met her husband on the set of Mad Max: Fury Road. he was Tom Hardy's Stunt man."
"This is sadShe'll be back....but a little different.I would have felt bad for her if she hadn't been in the new Star Wars abortion. I would ask why they're bothering with that awful franchise again, even though it's clearly done, but then I remembered that most retards are Star Wars fans. Now I used to volunteer with the mentally disabled and Star Wars was their favorite movie because the simplistic story and flashing lights were appealing to them, but I just didn't realize so many Americans were suffering with mental disability. Nobody cares what you think. You're a goddam jackoff. Star Wars is played out. The new movie might be entertaining, but Lucas hammered in the death nail when he sold everything to Disney.Is there a name for what's wrong with you?"

">In the 70's even adult movies were still shot on film. Quite a number of them had a story, a budget and some even had good actors. But not this one. There is no story to tell: we just see one sex scene after the other. The budget must have been low, for there are no remarkable locations or good effects. The acting is deplorable, even for adult movie standards."
">The movie starts off with an 'incest scene'. Father Zebedy Colt (how unattractive you want your porn actor to be) fools around with his daughter. She is played by Jean Jennings. They did a good job casting her for the part, for she really does look like a teenager. But not a very exciting one and she probably is one of the worst actresses in adult movie history. Father regularly sings Oh My Darling. Probably meant to be funny, but in this case just lack of any good ideas. The following scenes are just as depressive."
">This movie belongs to the worst made in the Golden Era of porn: the 70's. You will get more aroused by watching the light of the hard disk on your computer for 65 minutes. And it doesn't matter whether the computer is turned on or not. I rate this , well ehhhhh, thing, a 1 out of 10."
">You will get more aroused by watching the light of the hard disk on your computer for 65 minutes."
"Challenge accepted.Sounds great!Would people actually go and watch these movies, like they were normal movies in the 70s?"
"Or was it just accepted as somewhat normal behavior to beat off during the movie?"
"I can't imagine going to that movie and trying to watch it beginning to end like a normal movie being an enjoyable experience. Back then the spank bank was in your head. If you didn't have some 8mm films and a projector or some magazines back home you had to just *remember* that shit later on.Sears catalog.That's a reality too cruel to even imagine. As a kid I was always perusing the movie page to see what was playing so I could hound my parents to go see movies. I remember porn movies being advertised in the papers then. I also remember a lot of them played in regular theaters just rated R instead.  I was particularly upset when they went to see Alice in Wonderland: An adult musical comedy and didn't take me along.

They did a good job casting her for the part, for she really does look like a teenager. But not a very exciting one and she probably is one of the worst actresses in adult movie history. Father regularly sings Oh My Darling. Probably meant to be funny, but in this case just lack of any good ideas. The following scenes are just as depressive.*"
"*This movie belongs to the worst made in the Golden Era of porn: the 70's. You will get more aroused by watching the light of the hard disk on your computer for 65 minutes. And it doesn't matter whether the computer is turned on or not. I rate this , well ehhhhh, thing, a 1 out of 10.*"

"So basically; better than the Twilight saga?Your Dad was from Milwaukee, hey?"
"The 41 Twin drive-in was AMAZING...tore it down and turned it into the headquarters of an insurance company...Fucking assholes.We used to live really close to there, I was so upset when they tore that down. I saw Saturday Night Fever at the 41 Twin.  So many memories there and at the Silverlight (My sister used to work at the Silverlight...saw Star Wars there like 40 times that summer)Wisco represent!Wisconsin, checking inI was in Milwaukee for work once, very cool city. I drove up the shore and wow, such a nice quality of living, everyone was so shiny and happy."
"edit: and the lake was amazing beautiful.I drive past where the Victory drive in was (or, at least, where my dad tells me it was) every day.  Now it's basically an overgrown field.  One of my friends grew up in the subdivision right next to it -- he used to paintball there.Then there's an ad mentioning the Starlite drive-in. I would always go past there as a kid (never went in). Now it's a grocery store...but it was turned down well before the conversion."
"I'm not old enough to know any of those theaters, but I recognized the mention of Brookfield Square and Mill Road. I'm in another suburb not far from there.YEP good ol' Northwestern Mutual! You could always get 2 for 1 movies and in the hot summer nights it was fun!I didn't notice until i saw The Downer listed... then i went back and had my oh cool moment.If my hazy 20+ years ago memory serves, my parents took 6 year old me to see Jurassic Park and some other movie I didn't care about at that drive in.  It was seriously the dopest shit ever.The thing that bothered me the most about it...it went literally from something that was a slice of what America WAS to the banal reality of what America IS."
"America used to be kind of adventurous, kind of fun. We had our problems...like drive-ins do, where the reception kind of sucked, and it wasn't in great stereo, but you got to have a little bit of fun on the weekend, and the kids could stay in their pajamas."
"Now, it's insurance claims and 'can we afford the gas money?' and 'oh the mosquitos' and we're all so up our own asses about how worried we are about how tomorrow's going to end up, because everything's so much more expensive, families can have that one BIG adventure per year...Disney or Six Flags or whatever...that they can't have that little weekly adventure anymore."
"Just bums me out sometimes.Tore down a drive-in, put up an insurance shop... ooh wa WA WA waChrist, right in the feels. My grandmother took me to see Star Wars at the Brookfield Square mall cinema like three or four times, I was about 8-years-old. Also, I was allowed to see Orca in theaters but not Jaws. Go figure."
"I saw both around the time I was 11. To this day I do not think about Killer Whales when I swim in the lake, but I still keep my eye out for Sharks.I recognized those theater names too. Reading through those, I was like I'm sure lots of places have a Northridge and Southrodge... And Good Hope isn't too off of a name... Hmm... Bluemound, that is starting to get suspicious... Downer? Yep. That's home!Noticed the milwaukee landmarks immediately also, very cool! Now there's only a couple decent theaters to catch a flick :(I've never seen it referred to as Monty Python's Jabberwocky.  I doubt they would have approved of that billing.Well, it worked. I might not have Googled it and didn't even realize Terry Gilliam had a first film named Jabberwocky, despite loving Brazil, Twelve Monkeys, etc."
"The Wikipedia article says it was advertised as Monty Python's despite Gilliam's protests. That had to be frustrating.I was just thinking that. Only three of the Pythons were actually involved.Monty Python is multiple people? How old are you?27 and I never really got into Monty Python, nor his American friend National Lampoon for that matter. He's like Voltron.Technically three were. Isn't that what he said?Yeah, but this guy got technical.I do remember being excited about it coming out, after Holy Grail blew my young mind. But then a friend saw it and said it had about 1 1/2 funny bits.Wait... Are we still talking about *Sharon*?No, that's Jabbercocky.Beware the Jabbercock, my son!"
"The rod that spreads apart the hatch!"
"Beware the rub-tug girl, and shun"
"Her frumious Bandersnatch!Imdb lists it as an alternate title .... in west germany.You felt the need to blur out 35 year - old theater phone numbers? No, OP didn't. All of the theaters are in Milwaukee, and I'm pretty sure only one or two of them still exist.'cause I was gonna call and get tickets for Friday Night.I was going to call to ask about that movie called Sharon. It actually makes sense because somebody still uses those phone numbers, even if it's not the 1977 movie theater. You give a phone number out to 8 million redditors and some of them are going to give it a call. OP is looking out.They probably have extensions by now. Yeh. What gives? Even in '77 these numbers would have been freely available?"
"Edit: maybe they would have been recycled by now? Might have been a smart move....Maybe he doesn't want people to know what state/city his dad lives in? Of course a quick google search on any one of those theatres quickly reveals the answer. Doesn't look like many of them still exist, which is kinda sad."
"My neighbourhood cinema is still rocking right at the bottom of my street. Took the kids to see Minions in the same theatre my mom took me to see Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom 30 years ago. Also charming to reminisce my mom taking a 6 year old to see a movie where a dude gets his heart ripped out and shown to him, as was the style at the time. Ever tie an onion to your belt?Gimme five bees for a quarter! >Took the kids to see Minions"
"Why would you do that to yourself? Parents do all kinds of stuff for their kids. That was the least of the sacrifices I make for them. I know, I was just making a half-assed joke."
"But thanks for remind me of one of the many reasons why I never want any kids. I'm in my late 20s and so far I've miraculously managed to avoid having them. Unfortunately I can't say the same for my brother, who is a worse versiom of me and thus has no business being a father. Yea I would have opted for vasectomy and possibly castration vs. having kids when I was your age. Aw, I'm so jealous! All my childhood theatres are gone, and even one of the ones where I had my first movie date with my husband."
"It's funny you mention about taking a 6 year old to Indiana Jones - my husband and I were discussing the difference between 1980s PG and PG now in reference to Goonies not too long ago.[west allis, wisconsin.](http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/2927)"
"[brookfield, wisconsin](http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/6656)."
"etc. Wisconsin.Those were theaters in the Milwaukee area. I recognized one of them which I worked at in High School. Most that I recognized are since closed.I'd like to imagine Eric, Hyde & Kelso hanging out in front of these theatersImagine if 1977 answered when you called themSome of them were left behind to wrap things upSweet reference broWe just saw an opportunity to buy the domain name after everyone committed suicideSounds like a Stephen King story.It actually was."
"Sorry, Right number."
"He wrote the short story that was developed into a script for the show, Tale From the Darkside. Sounds like a Twilight Zone episode.and asked for their newspaper back1995 called, it wants its 'certain year called and it wants its blank back' formula back.YEA?!?!  Well I had sex with your WIFE! Why even try, Jerry?Then you'd have to call October 21st 2015 and ask Old Biff for the Time Machine.TIL Orcas hunt across time. This really scares meThe ancient Romans called him Orca Orcinus, Latin for the Bringer of Death.Memento MorcaAnd land is no obstacleOf course not. They've constructed a series of breathing apparatuses made with kelp. They'll be able to trap certain amounts of oxygen. It's not gonna be days at a time. An hour? Hour forty-five? No problem. That gives them enough time to figure out where you live, go back to the sea, get some more oxygen, and stalk you. You just lost at your own game. You're outgunned and out-manned.Thanks for the fuck shack"
"-Dirty Mike and the boysIn the movie The Deep there is a prop underwater photography strobe light (red housing) that starts flashing repeatedly during a dramatic scene.  I helped make that prop when I worked at Subsea Products in La Jolla, Ca.That's really awesome. Are you still making props?No.  The company actually made underwater photography strobe lights, as a business, and was approached to make one fully functional photography strobe and the 'disco' stand-inversion for the movie.  I just helped with the assembly and functional testing.  The red colored cast-epoxy housings was a non-standard color the studio requested."
"So long, long ago.The Deep was an awesome movie. I remember seeing it in a theater with some girl I only dated a couple of times."
"I definitely remember the movie more than i remember the girl.That's very cool! Make anything for other movies?No.  My 15 minutes.Props on your work! fuckin cheekyhttp://imgur.com/lUBqdzfhttp://i.imgur.com/41m6ggt.jpgMan I love this shit, thanks for posting.I would heartily follow a sub based solely on old cinema adsI've got a few I could post!Ah, this brings back memories.  Going through the paper to find a movie to go to over the weekend.  Its funny how information just exploded in the last 20 years with the internet.  Now if someone in a movie twists an ankle you hear about it that night.  Back then, i just remembered being mad finding out from kids at school that Gremlins 2 opened and I didn't even know about it.  Seriously mom and dad, you have like 1 job.  And that shit was out of the theaters for like 2 weeks.  And it wasn't like it is now, now stuff comes out and 6 months later its on DVD, shit would come out, leave the theaters and then take like 2 years to come out on VHS.  And we liked it!!!I remember calling the theatre for showtimes into high school."
"You'd call and wait for the recording to list all the films, their descriptions, and the showtimes (could take several minutes). However, our local theatre only had one phone line, so most of the time you were waiting to catch the machine between callers. You'd dial every 5 seconds or so, then hang up at the busy signal."
"If you were competing with several others, you might be dialing for 20 minutes or more."
"Once I could dive, I'd just meet few friends at the theatre and we'd pick what we wanted to see based on what was showing when we arrived.I don't remember looking in the newspaper, but I remember having to call the movie theatre to find out the times for movies, and having to listen to EVERY SINGLE MOVIE until you got to the one you wanted."
"Life was inconvenient then. /s>And we liked it"
"Would you like it now?[Reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbU4Cb4A4-o)I thought the same! Now the thought of looking at movie times from newspapers seems just ridiculous, almost Victorian. Oh marvelous! The paper here says there are living pictures in the city!"
"That also made me think how pirating films was distributing physical shitty blurry VHS copies within your IRL friends. For some reason it was always their big brother who go them and every pirated horror movie was rumored to be banned in 943 countries."
"It's kind of sad the movie The Ring came out so late. It would have been much more effective if it would have been made ten years earlier or something.Kind of off topic, but related to the pirating.  I remember very early on the internet, one of the early issues of piracy was sites that had guitar tableture.  Music companies were suing a website because they would allow people to post their interpretations of guitar fingering for songs.  I want to say it was OLGA online guitar archive, or something like that.I was born in the 70's and remember my parents taking me to see Star Wars, but I don't think they ever took me to see Empire Strikes Back.  Now, if you don't see a movie at the theater,  its out on dvd or on demand in a few months.   Back then,  i think it might have been years until some movies made it to television.   I was young,  so I'm just going on what I remember. And had to turn to the newspaper for the TV listings as well (unless you had TV Guide I suppose).  But since there were less than 100 channels, the listings didn't take up that much space.  But you could never know which episode of the show you wanted to watch was going to be played, and you had to plan your other events around something you wanted to watch, unless you wanted to deal with the hassle of the VCR."
"Then for a few years between the now standard interactive channel guides and DVRs, you had the scrolling TV guide listing channel... that you always managed to switch to just as the channel you wanted to know about had scrolled past, meaning you had to wait for it to come back around again.  And of course, it only showed what was currently playing and the next two (3?) hours."
"All that of course, after walking two miles uphill in waist deep snow just to get to the TV, and if there was nothing on TV that interested you, well, by God you still watched *something* and you liked it.It also brings bad terrible memories of trying to call to get movie times and getting a busy signal or having to wait through the whole"
"Thanks for calling Mann Cinema 6! Located conveniently off of El Camino Real and Highway 78 in Oceanside! Did I ever tell you about my childhood? I know you wanted to hear times and prices, but here's some other bullshit you don't care about!"
"[Why don't you just tell me the name of the movie you selected](https://youtu.be/qM79_itR0Nc?t=23)You have selected... Regicide.... if you know the name of the king or queen being murdered, press 1I still can't get over the name Albert R. Broccoli.Came here just to see how many up votes Mr. Broccoli  had. Vile weedOn one of the posters one actor's name was Ed Flanders.He also went by the nickname Cubby.they had something to do with breeding what we call broccoli nowI think the word for the vegetable comes from a family name.His nickname was Cubby. No, I'm not making this up.I would hope anyone that visits /r/movies has heard of Cubby Broccoli and Eon Productions. They're still making the Bond series, albeit with Cubby's daughter these days.cubbySince his death, his daughter has been producing the Bond films."
"Barbara Broccoli.I thought her name was Heada?That's Hedley.According to his [New York Times obituary](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/29/arts/albert-broccoli-film-producer-dies-at-87.html), his uncle was in the vegetable business and brought the first broccoli seeds to America."
"That was a story he spread himself.upvoted on the off chance this was a pun.Spreadable broccoli? Get on it now!A lot of people don't like that name, but it's actually really good for them.Says Mister Rawcookiedough.Sean Connery would curse you for saying this, but 100% agree afterwards.You son of a bitch! Coffee just shot out of my nose!I call broccoli the Devil's Toothbrush.Just be glad Broccoli doesn't come out with spaghetti westerns, that would be a bad combination.  Instead it's Broccoli with all the cheese and corn of Roger Moore Bond flicks. (tbh, I like Moore's flicks, The Spy Who Loved Me is one of my favorites...because nobody does it better)Too much.They might like it with some pasta and Alfredo sauce"
"edit: umm... I mean AlbertoWell, as it's Roger Moore as Bond, it already comes served with a thick layer of cheeseJudging from the original Bond short stories I've read, Roger Moore's portrayal is actually pretty accurate.Roger took a totally different approach to Bond. People who don't think bond should ever be played for laughs, often hate his approach."
"But I have to admit, I actually found his deadpan humor pretty funny.Pasta by Alfredo or Alfredo's Pasta Cafe?"
"Didn't Dana Carvey do an SNL skit about chopping this guy up?There's a lady I know"

A great hockey comedy with Paul Newman in it.Might be one of the best sports comedy movies of all time.  Definitely in the top 10.We're making it look mean!The Spy Who Loved Me is one of the better James Bond films."
"Plus, [the theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at7xLnfubFY) is one of the better Bond openings.My personal favorite Bond girl from any of the movies is Stromberg's henchwoman [Naomi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GtuwgkM3w4). What a handsome craft.When they played that song as part of the MTV Movie Awards Lifetime Achievement Award montage for Chewbacca, I got a little misty-eyed.Saw it the other day, it's full-on cheese, but yeah, probably the best Moore Bond movie. Great opening ski scene, though my kids were laughing at the obvious green screen.Green screen my eye! That's old fashioned rear projection! (and it was always obvious, mostly)[Best example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrktxWUgcyA) of rear projection driving scene.I didn't realize that existed. Certainly isn't convincing. The stunt itself was spectacular, though.Funny part is that it was convincing enough for audiences (like me) at the time."
"Some day kids will be laughing at today's movies, even those with the best CGI.Yeah, I don't remember being jarred by any of that when I was younger, or by the obvious matte work in Star Wars that looks so obvious now. It works OK for still backgrounds. You see it a lot for driving in old Hollywood movies (Hitchcock films are choked with it), and even then when it's a machine moving, it still doesn't quite work. Just one of those theatrical conventions that you learn to put up with and absorb the storytelling elements without thinking it looks real.I'm a sucker for On Her Majesty's Secret Service.  Had a huge markout moment when I heard the cues in the SPECTRE trailer.  Between mrs. peel, Louis Armstrong, OHMSS and how real that movie felt... One of the best.I went on *dates* to see some of these in theaters. I'm a full fledged geezer.One of my favourite movies, A Bridge too Far!"
"Why the heck did they list lesser knowns on the advert? Seriously, that film has Sean Connery, Anthony Hopkins, Michael Caine, James Caan, Robert Redford, Lawrence Olivier, Gene Hackman etc."
"And they put Hardy Kruger, Liv Ullmann and Maximillian Schell top of the bill? That movie had just about every cool lead actor of the 60s through the 80s in it. Love it. I like how Four years in production and preparation used to be a selling point.We worked hard on this please see it!it took 12 yearsI don't know how american cinemas work, but what does Passes Not Honored mean in the context of those films?Theaters give out free passes to see films, but sometimes will restrict when you can use the pass."
"They give out passes in the hopes you buy expensive popcorn. They don't want your free pass when they know the seat could be filled by a paying customer.See any movie except the ones everyone wants to see!Also, the studios will restrict the theaters' use of passes for movies that they hope will have big box office numbers.  They don't want a huge turnout on opening weekend with reduced box office totals.  So has anyone seen The Deep and can you please let me know if anything is worth the terror?It quite good, based on Peter Benchley's book (same guy who wrote Jaws)."
"Into the Blue is it's spiritual remake.I saw it many years ago. Wasn't bad. Jacqueline Bisset in a wet T-shirt is worth a look. Jacqueline Bisset in a wet T-shirt"
"This is the only thing I remember about that movie."

I was trying to figure out what that part meant.Ogie Ogilthorpe!First movie I ever watched on cable (I think it was on Showtime)."

Those guys are retards! They brought their fucking toys with them!"
"I believe this was one of Paul Newman's favourite movies.I think anyone walking out of Smokey & The Bandit saying it was 'jaunty fun' would have gotten their ass beat.Wow. I've seen Orca. It's a half rate JAWS ripoff. Sooo bad.I can somewhat recall one scene where he kills someone by repeatedly beating him against the ice with his tail.The only animal who kills for revenge!"
"Until Jaws 4...The producer on that was Dino de Laurentiis, grandfather of TV's Giada, and he also did a lot of other movies you may have heard of like the Conan series, Blue Velvet, Dune, Red Dragon, and Army of Darkness.I didn't realize jaws sparked so many rip offs. I've never seen orca or the deep but they both lol inspired by jawsI believe The Deep is your better bet, if only for [Jacqueline Bissett and her white T-shirt.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbc3wAB8lEM)The Deep isn't really like Jaws at all other than it takes place mostly in the ocean and has the guy that played Quint (Robert Shaw) in it. It's about a couple that finds a ship wreck with treasure and drugs while scuba diving and some bad guys want it too. It's a really good movie with a great cast actually.That sounds a lot like that movie with Paul Walker...Well considering Paul Walker was probably about 3 or 4 when The Deep came out, I'd say it's the other way around.I know, it was a joke more than anything :)"
"The movie I was thinking of was Into the Blue. Paul Walker and Jessica Alba go scuba diving and find cocaine in a downed airplane. Their buddy takes some of it and the drug cartel comes after them to get it back.Nick Nolte was in it, in his prime. For the record there is a pretty hairy scene with a shark in it. So were Jacqueline Bisset's boobies.Damn straight. Upvoted.The Moray Eel was the star, scary animal of The Deep, but it wasn't the antagonist like Jaws was.Killer Whalenado doesn't quite have the same ring to it.I know that technically Jaws is a 'better' movie from an academic standpoint, but I'd rather watch Orca any day of the week. I mean violently depressed Orca murder-suicides whole village is a pretty sweet plot for a movie.I'd love to see a reboot that takes place in SeaWorld.Have you seen Blackfish?Yes. That was riveting stuff.Hey, that Orca deserved revenge after what Dumbledore did to his wife and unborn baby.But it was so much fun in an awful-some sort of way.  Just like SciFi movies.  They are awful, but they are an awesome way to just let your brain go to mushI like how the ad says the only animal that kills for revenge. I guess people didn't count back then. Humans were classified as animals from 1983 onwardMilwaukee, WI?Most definitely!Yay for MilwaukayI have an old newspaper from 1989 with some interesting ads in it. I should try to find it. I swear to god that Christopher Walken's McBain came out in 1989, but according to every source I've come across (aside from the paper), it came out in 1991.

'Southtown 2' miss the pit :(The Mill Road Triplex....was upgraded to a 4 plex around '80 then a 6 plex in the mid 80's.  Saw so many movies there.  Closed like a year, year and a half ago."
"So sad that so many theaters in town have gone the way of the dodo. Mayfair and a couple on the far south side are the only multi-screens left in town proper i believe.  Since i live near where the Mill Road Multiplex and Northtown Multiplex used to be, i end up taking my kids to Mequon these days.Someone not having done something with Cinema 1 & 2 (later The Grand) is, for me, the biggest crime. I get that it probably wouldn't sustain a movie theater these days, but it seems it wouldn't be hard to do *something* with it. From what I understand, it's like a time capsule in there, like they closed up for the night one night and just never came back.> it's like a time capsule in there, like they closed up for the night one night and just never came back."

I'm old enough to remember most of those ads, but more importantly that was the year that cemented me as a lifelong Star Wars fan.  I'm looking forward to being 5 years old again this December.I have a very distinct memory of seeing Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo in the theaters when it came out!  Granted I was only 8, but still.  Fuck I'm old....I had a TV recording of Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo on VHS as a kid. I may have watched it 1000 times. However, I haven't watched it for at least 20 years now. I'm afraid I'll rewatch and it'll be awfulI just saw it like a month ago.  It's not horrible, I enjoyed it from a nostalgia standpoint.Fuck Benji!"
"Went to see Star Wars for a second time and they showed that crap by mistake."
"So fuck Benji!"
"Yes I still remember!!!Couldn't you walk out? Or is that just what your parents told you?Ah, i grew up with these movies,  this bring back good memories Jesus, what did they do to Roger Moore's face?"
"He looks like Val Kilmar with something stuck in his ass.Awesome! I saw 3 of those movies in the theater in 1977!  Star Wars, Bad News Bears and Herbie! PG? Bad News Bears would be rated X for being insensitive today.  Ah, back in the day when you could write a whole movie around a sweet car.Of course Jabberwocky was not a Monty Python film but a Terry Gilliam film that just happened to star Michael Palin. I remember Gilliam not being happy with the way the studio chose to advertise it.The spy who loved me, one of the best bond films.Rated X hell yeah hahahah!!!The Island of Dr. moreau poster is so cool.

"grumpy old man who doesn't like this newfanglednessNone of the kids on this board are listening to you. They are too busy taking selfies. Also in the olden days of newspapers, you got photostat art of the movie promo, and then you had to cut it up and rearrange it to make it fit whatever rectangular ad size that the theater paid for. You'd use hot wax to lay downthe pieces on the art board which was then photographed and turned into a printing press plate. You'd then save the ad so you could use it the next day. Those grids of movies were continually reused. When movies changed, you'd peel off the old movie and replace it with new art, over and over again until the wax cruft built up too much and you were forced to start clean. Look at the ads in these clippings closely, you'll see all sorts of misalignments and built-up gunk.TILGod, this.

It would get rough if we kept the movie too long, though, because we didn't have a copier in house so we'd run out of the proper size."
"The worst was when the damn title art didn't stuff before the deadline. The newspaper would just plug in genetic fonts and it looked awful."
"I also remember the placement of theatre logos in the co-op ads was always political. The theater placing the ad always took the far left slot, then they'd stick their nearest competition in the worst spot they could find. Usually we'd have five locations in the ad, so that would be the fourth one over. ...and each one of these ads probably had all of this shit done in about six minutes.At school we did newspaper paste-up like this. Wasn't uncommon for a story to be printed with a big white space where the photo fell off.Yeah. Working with your hands. Like god intended. Kids these days don't know they're born.Do kids these days use mind-control to create things? Or do they still use their hands?Yeah, the use that Mindcraft thing, I hear. What's wrong with playing with rocks? Rocks were good enough for me.Damn right a rock. And a stick too if we were lucky.You sound like you welcome change with open arms.Yup. We were on the tail end of traditional publishing and DTP when we were doing our underground newspaper, so we did what we could on computers, but laid everything out by hand."
"Even if I knew where the old SyQuests were, I still couldn't reproduce the layouts...sometimes we'd do a 2nd run of the paper and the layout would look really different because we'd have stuff move around every so slightly and we could only afford so many copies per print run.Hah, I had a 'zine. Remember those? The only reason my friend and I started it was because we got our hands on a surplus mimeograph machine from a school. Eventually we upgraded to a Xerox."
"We didn't even have anything to write, we just decided we had to do it once we got the means to. We sold utter garbage for fifty cents a copy that nowadays wouldn't even qualify for a MySpace page and all our friends thought it was awesome. We were keeping everyone up to date on what was going on in the scene. Those were the days.I've seen every one of those movies the same year they came out, and even fapped to a few of them.You fapped to the guy shitting out the window in Jabberwocky didn't you?/r/oldschoolcoolI can't tell where that bond chick's knobs startThat's Barbara Bach. She was awesome back in the day. Also in one of my favorite movies, Force 10 from Navarone. It stars Harrison Ford among many others.Also the hottest Beatle wife.That is actually really cool. I'm sure that Star Wars one could be worth quite a bit to the right collector[deleted]And then hosed the fetus off the deck into the ocean.Bronson and Coburn in Hard Times? Cool have to check it out!We didn't have Flixster back then.  It's the only way we knew what was playing without waiting for the stupid and slow automated message that was busy 90% of the time.Awesome!I like how the horror films are rated as PG."
"Nanny state be damned.The Island of Dr Moreau, or Altered Beast, the movie.When it had Held Over in the ad, you just know it had to be good!Cool! That's a good find. Some collectors would pay a lot for these kinds of things. Gene Shalit's quote on Smokey and the Bandit is the most 70's thing ever.So many twins and triplexes, now only two or three screens is crazy small.I love how the Monty Python advert needs no description or introduction. These are fantastic!  I miss these kinds of movies ads."
"I was going to say that ive seen all those films but one, but the curiosity got the better of me and thanks to cornalsanderscult now ive seen them all..ugh man, there was no such thing as landscaping back thenThought the most interesting one was for 'The Spy Who Loved Me' saying it was 'Held over for the 4th week'. Now movies stay in theatres for months especially big names like Bond, Jurassic Park etc. That's why movies are making so much more at the box office now I think but could be wrong.thanks for blurring out the numbers - redditors can't be trustedI saw Star Wars at a drive-in. It was magical.Me too. It's the first movie I remember seeing as a kid. I'd really like to get some of these as posters... Does this exist as a poster genre? Anybody got an idea as how to make that a thing?I wonder if I (45) am the only one that saw Star Wars when it came out at a drive in..Nope. 46 here, I saw it at the Hi-way 39 on Beach Blvd in Garden Grove when it came out. There's a fucking Walmart there now. Geeze, I forgot that we saw Smokey and the Bandit at the drive-in, and the lead in movie was a Benji movie.Held Over. Wow. That was a thing I'd forgotten about.I saw Star Wars at the Mill Road Triplex in 1978.  Even a full year later (I'm often late to the party), there were still lines for each showing.  I've been to many of the theaters in those ads.  Yes, including the Parkway."
"Thanks for the memories.I should do the Star Wars one in Legos...That needs to be framed!A Sinbad movie and Norman... is That You is an odd double feature. https://youtu.be/ogwJVph5z9EI remember those days.  Opening the paper, seeing ads like that and trying to figure out what you want to see.  Now I just take my phone, fire up Google or Fandango and can find the movies & order the tickets within a few minutes.I see they had already caught onto the no passes thing.roger moore............Man, I never realized how many theaters Milwaukee used to have. If anyone wants to see week two and three clippings if Star Wars IV, here you go. http://m.imgur.com/a/qaNzLI remember the days of having to get a newspaper to see what movies were playing and the times they started.  Apps like Flixster on my phone are just ridiculously handy for this type of thing.  Whoa I never knew there was a second Bad News Bears. Is it any good? Holy shit. I had completely forgot that this is how I used to look for movies. Thanks for the nostalgia OP.This is an incredible step back in time. I was 17. I remember seeing some of these in the theater. Everything is so different, now. From the copy/paste artwork done by hand to the 7-digit phone numbers, the computer chip has completely changed so many industries. This was the only way to see what movies were playing. Even the TV ads back then said the generic at a theater near you. You had to get a paper. Summer of 77 was the best. I was about to turn 17,had bought my 69 GTO Judge from working part time at the supermarket bagging groceries for the past year and must have saw Smokey and the Bandit and Star Wars at least ten times each that summer. Star Wars stayed running in one theater or another for over a year. It was that big. I saw all those films except the x rated one. On a related note, I think Barbara Bach is the most beautiful Bond girl. If I had been a teenager in '77, I would've had her poster on my wall for sure.The summer of 1977 was the summer of the [Farrah Fawcett poster](http://www.bellazon.com/main/uploads/monthly_01_2015/post-89835-0-14764500-1421237820.jpg).Holy crap! Sharon was the first porn I ever saw. Ah, memories of bad incestral lines: Does Momma do it like this Daddy? Child, the only thing that woman puts in her mouth is corn bread.I have a confession."
"I absolutely love Python, and have never heard of Jabberwocky."
"[Just watched a clip.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8apNuRgWFWo) [Gotta go buy it now.](http://www.amazon.com/Jabberwocky-Deborah-Fallender/dp/B00005OKQK/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1442422601&sr=8-2&keywords=jabberwocky+python)"
"Milwaukee!!Is your dad the Zodiac?Sad how the times have changed. 1977 - MacArthur revered. Today - Would be portrayed as an evil, brutal, warmonger. Oh probably a racist and homophobic too.Sad?I'll never understand this line of thinking.  The earliest view people have of a major public figure is usually wrong.  There's simply not enough known information about a person at the time, especially pre-Internet and TV, to make an accurate judgment.  So you get heroes like MacArthur.  Then, as classified documents and detailed biographies are completed as the years pass, you get a better picture of the person.  So that would explain the change in how we view people like MacArthur. Knowledge isn't a bad thing.I guess passes have just never been acceptedYou should have heard the radio ads for The Exorcist!"
"Wasn't expecting Milwaukee to pop up here!"
"Also, I miss the Downer something fierce. Ever since I moved away, I miss them and the Oriental for films if normally not see :( Please tell me those are both still operating...They're both alive and well. (I was just at the Oriental last night.)Good year for classic movies and classic dudes to be born into the world.I remember as a kid going right to the movie section of the newspaper to see those glorious full page advertisements for them.  You always kinda knew what movies were new because of the full page ads."
"tl;dr:  Am old.I genuinely miss the movie promo art style of the 70s. It's very nostalgic for me. I remember wandering the aisles of the movie rental places, looking at the artwork and wondering what the movies were about. I remember being afraid to go down the horror aisle. I definitely remember the cover for The Deep and finding the blackness of the water to be scary.Herbie! <3Hello fellow MilwaukeeanI immediately started smelling mothballs for some reason....trippy!Good old Jamie Gillis RIP. The enema bandit himself. This is really cool to look over. TIL Richard Pryor looks like Fred Armisen.Why did blur out the theaters?Albert R. Broccoli is the perfect name for, well, just about anything. Imma have to google that guy. If someone today would have the brain to advertise their movie like that it would be a hit.Ah, the 70s. Where PG meant a couple of tits and a swear word.I'm pretty sure I saw Star Wars at Spring Mall!The Benji movies were my favorite as a kid.Did your dad grow up in SE wisconsin? I was 12 in 1977 and remember most of these coming out. I used to LOVE movie ads in the paper as a kid. Them along with comics and baseball scores. I loved how they would keep track of how long shows were in theater and get super pumped anytime a new animation or sci-fi flick was coming. Most of these are from Wisconsin. I actually saw Star Wars in Spring Mall, Brookfield Square, West Town, and South Town...God do I miss Spring Mall...There was a Aladdin's castle right next to the movie house. You would go see a movie and hit the arcade. Fun times, fun times man...."
"edit:wordMilwaukee?Are you in Wisconsin!?Milwaukee! None of these theatres are still there though.I am surprised no one has tried to do a retro-drivin in theater, charge $10 a car, would be great.Those are still around. I used to live about 5 miles from one. I moved and now live about 2 miles from a drive-in. This one doesn't do the carload thing though. I believe it's $5 for adults and $3 for kids.Passes not honored?Interestingly low-tech, homemade looking ads.  Jabberwocky wasn't a Monty Python film, for example."
"And also interesting that a UA theatre was showing X-Rated fare.Wait, Does this mean people used to go to movie theaters to see Porn and pay for it???Greetings fellow Wisconsinite. I saw Smokey and the Bandit at the Starlite Drive In when I was a kid. Thanks for the memory.. :)Orca had a cute logo.What does passes not honored mean?I'd love a more modern movie based on MacArthur, that shows him in a less positive light.What's with all the sequels and remakes and adaptations? Man, Hollywood just doesn't have any original ideas at all lately ....Wow, such a great time for movies. I haven't seen Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo.Thank you for this!"
"My dad used to buy me the newspaper every Sunday because I liked to look at the movie ads (the local paper most weeks, the New York Times if I was especially good.)  I learned how to tell if a movie was doing well or badly based on the size of the ad (and if it was in color!)"
"This was the early-to-mid-90s.  Is there a subreddit just for movie ads?  /r/AdPorn that Star Wars ad is greatI miss the pure awesomeness of those times.  Save them! Frame them!There's not 1977 of them, just 13!Wow.   Small world.  Most of those theaters are gone, but I recognize a lot of the names.  A lot of them are before my time, but I recall my parents mentioning them."
"I remember going to the 41 Twin Outdoor with my family when I was younger.  It's a shame the only drive in around here now is like 45 minutes west.Jamie Gillis....  The consummate cocksman.Rabid! On the last one, amazing and cheesy porn horror film."
"Marilyn Chambers!!! Ah, I remember the raging teen boner I had well. It was weird...Wait, they advertised it as Monty Python's Jabberwocky?DopeWhat do they mean by passes not honored?You're in Milwaukee!  Those are from the Journal - i recognize the theaters."
"My sister used to work at the consession stand at the Starlight Drive In - i must have seen Star Wars 30-40 times that summer.Those are awesome! Thanks for sharing :)Whoo hoo! SlapshotIn the summer of 1977 my sister and her friend took me to see a new movie called Star Wars. It was the 1st and only time that I have been to a movie that got a standing ovation in the theatre.Milwaukee journal sentinel?Jaunty Fun!TIL that Fred Armisen was in Greased Lightning. On the 'The Spy who loved me ad, Roger Moore looks like a Ken doll.This just made me feel old, remembering that you had to look in the newspaper to see what movies were playing :(Man, I remember checking the newspaper for movie show times every weekend as a kid. Aside from Sunday comics, it was the one thing I enjoyed about the newspaper. And then just after high school Movie Phone became a thing, so even that went away.Jabberwocky was not a monty python movie (though it was directed by a python). Seems like the ad agency was taking some creative liberties in an attempt to put butts in seats.Back before PG13."
"All of these are either G/PG or X. Weird there were no R movies, particularly given the subject matter of some of these. Whilst viewing these I could smell old newspaper.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SynesthesiaHoly shit, was that Archers likewise in that second photo? HahahaI saw Star Wars at the Spring Mall on 76th St. Wow... thanks for this great memory!"
"Smokey&The Bandit. Jaunty FunIf I could go back in time...What is a Newspaper?God... I used to LOVE these movie ads in newspapers. I'd cut out my favorite ones all through the 80's and early 90's. Of course, those have long since been thrown away. I wish I still had them. Bottom image - Slap Shot - Best film there.Fans of Boogie Nights will recall that Eddie Adams became Dirk Diggler late in 1977..."
"I was born yesterday in 1977 and this made me feel even older. Thanks OP.What is passes not honored and suspended.THE DEEP - Great movie!The puck will drop for the NHL season in less than three weeks now!"
"Time to re-watch *Slap Shot* !!!"
"Fabulous film!Hey, Fatty! I've got a movie for ya: A Fridge Too Far! I like how passes for *A Bridge to Far* have been 'suspended.'"
"*wink*"
"All those ads came from the Milwaukee Journal or Milwaukee Sentinel ---- Almost all of those theaters listed are now closed ---- The Parkway was famous for showing X rated movies such as the classic; Behind the Green Door."
"They probably wish they saved the Beyond for the next Bond film. Why don't you just tell me the name of the movie you've"
"selected.Old newspapers sure emphasized movie ads.It's all there was back then, except for MovieFone in some markets.Saw Bronson in HARD TIMES in the drive-in.  Kick ass movie!Old newspapers sure are going slowly...1977 was a pretty good year.Wow, I actually enjoyed checking these posters/ads out.Thanks for sharing this. Brought back lots of great memories  [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/XHfBfZ7.jpg) made me chuckle!"
"This is some neat stuff.  I find it amazing all these movies (Star Wars, The Spy Who Loved Me, Bad News Bears (bt), Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo & Smoky and The Bandit) all came out arround the same time.  I guess that dates me."
"How cool, I remember those adverts and that summer. Except for the ad for 'Sharon', I don't think it had a screening in Utah..... if it did the ad would have been much smaller. lolPasses not honored -- in today's theaters, it means that you purchased a special pack of tickets (i think AMC has packs of like 10 gold and silver tickets where it's like purchasing a ticket at matinee pricing that you can use at night showings but you buy them in bulk)."
"Because of regulations with the film companies, for the first two weeks of showing (sometimes longer) the tickets can only be sold at the usual prices, since it costs more to rent the film and theaters can charge more. Usually there are stipulations on the back of these tickets, like no 3d movies."
"Theaters also hand out passes to people in theaters that have issues, like the lights were on the entire time, film stopped halfway through and then restarted after 10 minutes, film got tangled in the projector and film couldn't be shown, etc. Those passes could be used for certain films too."
"I assume this is similar. Theaters had specials on bulk tickets or there were special passes given out so the customer got to see the film at a discounted or free ticket price.Today I hit a new low when I mistook a young Richard Prior for Gilbert Godfrey  in *Greased Lightening*.You are not alone.Man, I love seeing these! They remind me of when I was a kid and helped my dad assemble the newspaper ads for our drive-in.  The distributors sent us pressbooks that contained the artwork and taglines in different sizes and versions. I would cut them out and my dad would paste or tape them onto a sheet of paper on which he had handwritten copy (like Starts Friday!). These would get folded into thirds, put into envelopes and hand-delivered to the local newspapers. I really liked doing it.  We'd get press kits for all different movies, even ones we weren't showing.  I think I still have some kicking around.  Maybe even a Star Wars one, assuming my asshole older brother didn't sell it along with the 300+ posters we'd acquired over the years.These are great.  I had to go through three summers ('75-'77) worth of microfiche for work a couple of months ago and I saw some of these.  It was really bizarre seeing ads for the original Star Wars and news about Elvis's death and stuff like that in the paper.I bet most of these theaters no longer exist.Which is why I'm curious why OP bothered to blur their phone numbers.In the 70s and today, passes are never honored.Fuck you, cinemas for not honouring my pass to Star Wars!!That batch had mostly PG movies. I wonder how difficult / relevant R rated movies were back then.  I would have thought the Pryor movie would have been R, but I've not seen it.The original Bad News Bears was awesome.Nothing was bigger than Smokey and the Bandit. Burt Reynolds was the man!HERBIE-DERBY!What did you blur on some of those images? Why? Probably the phone numbers. Those are all defunct theaters.Way cool!OH MY GOD, THAT'S FUCKING GREAT... RICHARD PRYOR, BURT LANCASTER, GREGORY PECK, BURT REYNOLDS... ALL ON THE SAME PAPER!"
"I THINK I LOVE YOUR DAD, GIVE HIM MY THANKS FOR ACTUALLY HAVING SAVED A PIECE OF MOVIE HISTORY:)If you're shouting about this, you'll pass out if you look at ANY of the packing material in my attic.  JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE MY VOICE WAS HEARD OVER THE HUNDREDS OF EVERYONE ELSE'S ;)Anyone else notice how many of these movies were rated PG and just how few nowadays get that rating? The MPAA just blows me away with how poorly it has aged as a grading system. I know this was before the advent of PG-13 but IMO it has just muddied the whole thing.Holy crap, that is the wrong way to market Jabberwocky. I know they needed to play up the Monty Python angle, but that's begging for moviegoers to misunderstand what they're in for. The good old days, when you went to a movie theater to watch porn.Back when every movie was PGthis is awesome i was born in '77 so i'm saving these ... curious, why you  blocked some of the places out? It was the phone numbers, which may belong to different people now. I figured why not?The Deep looks terrifyingSmokey and the Bandit was the first movie I saw, at the drive-inSome of those are probably worth some money to collectors. Most excellent content, thank you, sir. So my question is:  was it a matter of not having as many films trying to thrust their way into your conscience or that the films were more memorable back then?  At this moment, w/o doing any searches, I could not tell you one film in theaters right now, but I remember when those were in theaters (I remember the poster for Orca scared the hell out of me)."
"Well, except for Sharon... that's the first time I've seen anything for that.Same boat.  I think it's partly our age, too.  We're just not as tapped in to pop culture as we were back thenThat's far less than 1,977 ads.Holy crap, John Travolta must be old.Ha ha I can't believe you seriously felt the need to censor phone numbers from 1977 for theaters in Milwaukee and not all of them are even standing anymore haHard to believe but I guess the MPAA was even more of a sham then than it is now. All those movies were rated PG except the porno!You felt the need to blur out 35 year - old theater phone numbers? Is it still 2012?No wonder Star Wars did so well. It was competing with Herbie and Jabberwocky.That looks about right in the last picture, one decent movie, maybe two other so-so movies, and a bunch of crap.No Annie Hall? It only beat Star Wars for best picture that year.PG? Bad News Bears would be rated X for being insensitive today.  Before pg ratings. They're pretty cool. Weird. The very first two photos prominently show PG rating graphics."

"OP is a Kubrick fan. I believe your name could also be the title of a Kubrik film. Only bundles of sticks arE not Kubrick fans.OP is also an Anderson fan. Both are very good things.And a Terrence Malick fan......and a Ron Fricke fan......and a Tarkovsky fan.....to name the ones I noticed.And only ONE Barry Lyndon photo...are there any in this sub who aren't? ProbablyI thought A Clockwork Orange is entirely overrated and was a bunch of shock value garbage used to make a somewhat banal point and housed in an overly pretentious and entirely too long piece of cinematic mediocrity."
"Everything else is fantastic though.In that case it's not about the message I think. It's how it's done.Well, it's based on a book that was written in a weekend by a starving author who went against his norm and wrote a book for pure shock value knowing it would sell.Depends on your definition of fan. I think some of his films are vastly overrated and think think he has made one or two bonafide masterpieces. I don't consider myself a fan.[deleted]gr8 b8 m8, no h8You're probably right about not being a fan as two of those films were directed by Hitch ;)hahaha perfect!!I know you might be joking but I'm still childishly angry insideWhich is over-rated?Ahh man, don't make me do this on r/movies! :P"
"I think The Shining and Eyes Wide Shut are both masterpieces and I find Barry Lyndon to be very good when I'm in the right mood."
"But I find Strangelove, 2001 and Full Metal Jacket to all be merely good films and I feel a strong opposition when people declare them to be brilliant pieces of art. I think Lolita, Spartacus and particularly A Clockwork Orange are actively bad. I mean, I would love to explain why I think this about all the films but it would take a long, long time. My point was merely that it's alright to not be a fan of Kubrick and still love movies! :)what kubrick and trumbull did wasn't just magical; it was genius.  it took almost a decade (star wars 77') for any other filmmaker to catch up, and even lucus humbles himself when star wars is compared to 2001.  has the visual prowess of 2001 been diluted over the last 45+ years? almost a half-century later and it's still influencing filmmakers."
"for a moment: forget the plot, forget the acting, forget the score.  the technological and visual achievements alone make 2001: A Space Odyssey a masterpiece and most certainly a work of art."
"I think most people consider Barry Lyndon one of his weaker films (drawn out and dull in parts). It's interesting that the two you like most are his 1st and 3rd last films. 1st last film is a weird way to phrase that. I guess you could use antepenultimate and final films but no one uses that word anyway. Shit, I do now.His filmography is so varied that it doesn't surprise me how much people's favourites differ when it comes to Kubrick. I also think sometimes people are so awed by his vision that they misrepresent or actively ignore his flaws. If we're talking being a fan of a director, I'd assume you'd like almost everything they have done and be able to talk about them in detail. If course.I'm just a bit shocked about A Clockwork.  To date my favorite filmMy criticisms of Clockwork Orange aren't wholly original, they've all been said before. I find it to be a rather vapid, simple work that seems to think it's aiming high and that really irritates me. It's also a very cold, soulless film and I have zero connection or sympathy with any characters in the film or with the world that they inhabit. Usually this wouldn't bother me so much but it feels like Kubrick expects us to care about what happens to his characters without earning it in the slightest. Almost like reading a thesis statement rather than watching a film at times."
"But each to their own, of course. One of my favourite films is *The Monster Squad* and you could pick faults with that all night long if you wanted to, baby.Hey, man. Art is subjective. Until you join a community.I respect your opinion, but that physically hurt to read :PAre you not?Even more of a David Lynch fan.OP is also a Wong Kar Wai fan.  FTWNot OP's fault the majority of Kubrick's films are gorgeous And amazing. Thanks to Kubrick and OP, now my phone really [shines!](http://imgur.com/a/A919Q)I work at a phone store and often have to show customers my phone. I'm using these wallpapers.[Someone's gonna have to go back and get a shit load of dimes!](http://i.imgur.com/ZDxkNJq.png)PricelessIt's actually about 10c.Well, it's a lot of money when you add up 10C/ each for all those rustlers, cut throats, murderers, bounty hunters, desperados, mugs, pugs, thugs, nitwits, halfwits, dimwits, vipers, snipers, con men, Indian agents, Mexican bandits, muggers, buggerers, bushwhackers, hornswogglers, horse thieves, bull dykes, train robbers, bank robbers, ass-kickers, shit-kickers and Methodists.What about the ones that like rape, murder, arson, and rape?You said rape twice. We'll work up a Number 6 on 'em.There are way too many movies that could have been great if it weren't for shitty cinematography. These are great.So true, I would also say that awesome cinematography can make up for shitty acting/writing. I think a lot of horror films fall into this category (for me at least).as someone always looking to learn more, thanks for posting the cinematographer.  love that you included Hot Rod. it's a great example of a decent film that was made even better with good cinematography.There was a class, I belive at UCLA film on the Saving Power of the Cinematographer or something like that.Excited to see The Assassination of Jesse James on here, as that movie is beautiful. I wish the train scene had been made into one, though.This was filmed where I am from at Fort Edmonton! Angelina and Brad just casually hung out all around the city, I saw them from afar at West Ed! I got much too excited recognizing Edmonton in your pics! Great film, but it is so strange how so many people really hate it... I can't understand why anyone couldn't like it.People find it very boring. Which I can see. But if you understand what's going on, it's a very tense film throughout.I guess it is the same as why I hated Avatar. Boring as hell...Roger Deakins is amazing at what he does. I remember before I discovered him I had this seemingly random list of movies I thought had beautiful cinematography. After looking at his imdb page I realized I was just a huge fan of his. The same thing for me. One day I looked up who shot the movies I liked the look of the most. Deakins was the DP on 1/2 of my top 10 list. Worked at a independent movie theater when that came out, and it was awful to see it get so little traction in theaters.. Such a beautiful movie, and just about no one ever showed up for it's times."
"I didn't realize just *how bad* it did in theaters.. [30 million budget and only ~4 million domestic gross](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=jessejames.htm).. 15 million in foreign, but that doesn't even cover the budget.. Let alone the marketing budget (which I'm sure wasn't too high, but still at least 10 million).It's very easily one of my top 5 favorite movies. The soundtrack, the acting, the cinematography, the historical accuracy. Everything. Everything about that movie floors me. I understand the pace is too slow for some people, but I just become entranced when I watch it.I don't get how some friends of mine don't like it. It is probably in my top 5 favorite films. It is insanely gorgeous. The soundtrack can bring me to tears. Nick Cave & Warren Ellis are musical geniuses.[this](http://www.filmcaptures.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Assassination_of_Jesse_James_16.jpg)?That's a great one. Anything from that scene would be great. The train rounding the corner, the light illuminating the masked bandits, the train plow hitting the camera. Anything. Roger Deakins used an interesting lighting rig to get those night shots of the train. Read more about it here: http://www.theasc.com/ac_magazine/October2007/QAWithDeakins/page1.phpVery cool. Thank you for sharing.OP!!!!!! Ive been dedicating a few hours here and there to do exactly what youve done here. I just converted allll my thousands of dvds and blurays into mkv files, and can easily spend all day picking out the most perfect stills."
"Imma upload all the ones Ive done so far, to show you."
"We have quite a few of nearly the exact same stills from  Bergman, Lang, Kubrick, etc etc. Youre obviously a Criterion man.Seriously, Im torn between the joy seeing someone do exactly what i was about to do, and rage that you stole my thunder...http://imgur.com/a/fx4GWSHOW ME SOME LOVE OPNice stills. Do yourself a favour, complete the list and post it in a few days. I'm sure you will get a good reception. Make sure to include films that OP didn't!"
"Also, did you really reply to yourself 3 times?? :)Lool sorry, it was a attempt at not getting buried in the comments. Ill more likely finish my list in a few months, soooo many i need to add. Ive been picking them out here and there for a few months, with a vague plan to share them on reddit, and i panicked when i woke up to this thread haha. OP has some of the exact same frames as me, like the carriage ride at the beginning of The Magician, and the planetary alignment that opens the wormhole in 2001.I'm pretty sure replying to yourself that many times is going to accomplish the exact opposite. Just a friendly tip.[deleted]I had forgotten all about Night of the Hunter, which I watched over 10 years ago, until I saw this! You brought the creeps right back. I can hear the Shepherd singing. Fuck!Really great stuff. Love that you have The Seventh Seal. Top 10 movies for me without a doubt. Once Upon a Time in the West is also amazing, but really doesn't get the recognition that say, an Eastwood film does.I love you.Yessss, love you too op. Ill let you know when im finished my collection in a few months, should have at least 378 stills.Hmm...a Crystal Skull picture, eh?"
"It's a bold strategy, Cotton.Let's see if it pays off.Currently at +3620. I think it paid off."
"(Regardless of how you feel about the movie, it is a pretty sick shot!)I know I'm not the only one who's thinking it, but a movie obviously can have amazing cinematography and still be a shit pile of a film. Please post a zip file or something. imgur is no good for 379 images. If you make an imgur account, you can click 'download' on the right.  But  since this is a large album, it will ask to email you a link to a zip file.  Otherwise it will let you download stuff immediately.Imgur is giving an error when you try that with this album.put s. infront of imgur, so try this http://s.imgur.com/a/aoi3T then click download"
"Edit: I never got the zip file email so i used Internet Download managers grabber tool and got all the photo's apparently i have 729 though so i'm not sure if it got extra's or duplicates."
"https://mega.co.nz/#!wcRUDJKC!Z9xPBa2ubGgZzs3DlcnKIDKFzu7Kmis7YtVG8jhMeDYThanks! Tagged as BrilliantRarMaker thanks!Many thanks for compiling these.How is this comment so far down in this thread?!?!?"
"Thank you!A while ago a certain type of wallpapers started to appear on my desktop, I thought that they were paintings...."
"( www.google.com/search?q=makoto+shinkai+wallpapers&source=lnms&tbm=isch )"
"But one day I realised they are all anime movie caps. And that actually started all my interest in anime!"
"Ah Makoto Shinkai! He does great animation, similar to Hayao MiyazakiI've never seen a Makoto Shinkai film,  but I'd like to now...Anyone know which this is from? http://wallpoper.com/images/00/36/17/50/makoto-shinkai_00361750.jpg5cm per second: http://myanimelist.net/anime/1689/5_Centimeters_per_Second/This movie is often called 5 wallpapers per second due to how beautiful the scenery is.Make sure you dow....obtain the movie in 1080p! Anything inferior would be crime against beauty. All his other movies are also eye candy.Hell, he even made a 2 minute commercial that is awesome: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4QeeP8bI3c Good lord."
"Now I have to say, usually the language barrier kills it for me. Should I just watch it with subtitles in anyway?Just a heads up it's a pretty emotional movie.The Garden of Words was really good too.These are great! Thanks!Yeah, 5 centimeters per second is a stunning beauty. Days of Heaven is visually stunning. One of the most unappreciated movies out there at least in public sense. It's a shame that most of my friends will complain how it's slow and not appreciate the cinematography of it.> Days of Heaven'' is above all one of the most beautiful films ever made. - Roger EbertA Field in England is massively under appreciated. That and Berberian Sound Studio are definitely two of the most interesting British films in recent yearsI remember seeing the trailer and thinking I want to watch this. No one I know will want to watch it with me."
"I'd highly recommend me and my partner watched it when they released it live across a number of platforms.What the fuck is it even about! Either it just went over my head (which is probably what happened) or it's just a steaming pile of horse shit. Someone please tell me what it meant.I can only hope that Ben Wheatley continues to do awesome work with Laurie Rose.High Rise is coming next year. Awww yeah.Nice to see some Bergman, Antonioni and Godard.I'm having trouble downloading the archive from imgur. Does anybody have a link for it elsewhere?I'm having the same problem.wow I really love these.. Is there any way you could make a download link that contains the names? I'd love to use these but would still like too be able to keep track of what picture I'm actually using. Imgur filenames are useless for dumps like thesePlus imgur requires an email for ones this big =(  Unless if somebody knows a way to bypass that?[removed]That's what happens when I try too =(  Or it accepts it but I never get an email with the dl link.Does [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4OuUq_7CyLGbzh5SWdmRDlmZEE/view) work? I tried it once before but people complained that it didn't work. It would be nice if it worked.OP deliver please!I need all of these in hi-res and in a zip file. For my XBMC. Stat.Don't think it's gonna happen, the source  doesn't have any hi-res files unfortunately.*Testament of Dr. Mabuse* is one of the best films I've ever seen. [deleted]and The Matrix and Studio Ghibli filmsHowl's Moving Castle is in the album.[I run a similar site, Here ya go.](http://stillsfrmfilms.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/blade-runner/)Is there a link to download all the pics at once ?[deleted]http://www.mailinator.com/inbox.jsp?to=379desktopmoviestills"
"I made an email address at mailinator. Imgur still hasn't emailed it with the images, but it's there. Keep mailinator in mind for other times you might want a temporary email address. It's pretty awesome.[deleted]Hmm.. I was expecting that, too, but it did go through. Incidentally, that inbox has yet to receive the images. So something did go wrong :(Could someone post the file that imgur sends to your email? It's taking forever :-(~~Add /zip to the end of the url!~~"
"~~https://www.imgur.com/gallery/aoi3T/zip~~"
"Looks like they got rid of that, working on an alternative!this would be wonderfully appreciated!I use this:"
"http://ronfitzgerald.com/imgdl"
"Doesn't need any info or installation. It's awesome.Go to gallery page. Click Download on right side. I would link it but it uses javascript.I keep getting an Oops, something went wrong.Having the same problem as well when i enter my e-mail address."
"you have to log-inWhat are the resolutions on this set? Are they mostly 1080p?Try this link, posted above but no upvotes"
"http://s.imgur.com/a/aoi3T1920x864"
"Not even close to 1080 unfortunately.Most of them are from a blu-ray source, Blancanieves is the only DVD. A few of them might be from a movie I downloaded, which was set at 720p (Helter Skelter is one of them I believe).Great! This will add to my  collection then.Just to be nitpicky OP, but I've seen Sympathy For Lady Vengeance (great movie, btw) and I don't remember that scene being B&W. My memory could be hazy though, but I believe that should have been colour!"
"Also, great to see a few Korean films on the list. I'm a huge fan of Choi Min Sik (Old Boy, I Saw The Devil, and Sympathy for Lady Vengeance)./u/mimurph1 you should check out The Fountain. The movie is full of amazing visuals that would make great backgrounds wow these are fantastic, thanks... raided them."
"respect for Three ColorsMissing some Cohen brothers....some of the best shots I've seen are from no country for old men and fargoAgreed. No Country was a great movie and had some amazing scenes."
"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (US Version) had brilliant cinematography too. Love or hate the film, it was beautiful to watch.From looking at this list I am quite surprised that you didn't include Suspiria and little to no Fellini. [My personal fav](http://i.imgur.com/LmQNVCo.png) :)Every shot in Barry Lyndon is like a painting. Kubrick was a genius.It's actually quite haunting how close the cinematography in some of those scenes look like a victorian painting come to life. His understanding of lighting is very impressive.no Blade Runner? that movie has so much scenes that are so visually goodLove the Monolith looking up at the Sun and MoonNice, thank you.Looked through the whole set and snagged a few for my own background. Thanks! I'm glad to see a bunch of my favourite Foreign films in the list.Good stuff. Perfect amount of stills by the way. 380 would have been a bit much but 379 perfect.This also acts as a very good list of movies people need to see. Also, all these movies are worth watching.Do you have any from movies that I have seen?"
"Maybe I should just watch better movies...I have some stills from the director's cut of Mannequin 2 (On the Move) that I can upload.Well I've definitely heard of that! Yeah.... Upload them. Totally my favorite movie."
"That one part is so good. You know which part I mean.http://exclaim.ca/images/up-mannequin.jpgAgreed. I feel as if I have seen so many movies -- way more than the average person -- and yet I probably haven't seen even half of OP's list.Do yourself a favour, go through the list and pick 20 films that grab your attention (more than others) ... then find a way to watch those films. I've seen quite a few on the list and it's always great fun (to me) to find movies I haven't heard of/seen and watch them. I've got about 10-15 films from this list I plan to watch."
"Also read through the comments in this thread, there's some amazing films being mentioned that weren't on the list. Blade Runner is an obvious one (a few people have mentioned it)."
"Happy watching!Damn, I'm on my phone now, but if these are good enough quality for Wallpapers, I love you.These are all absolutely outstanding shots!"
"Now someone just needs to write a script that grabs a random picture from *filmcaptures.com* according to my top rated IMDb movies and sets them as my wallpapers.An excellent, eclectic, imaginative, gorgeous collection."
"I know it's alphabetical, but any set that starts with 2001 and Apocalypse Now and can still include History of the World, Part 1 has captured my attention."
"Bravo!DUDE *Blancanieves* is such a good movieAs soon as I saw All about lily chou chou I knew I'd find Hana and Alice in there. That movie is amazingly beautiful to watchThanks for putting some Inland Empire in there. Super underrated movieI haven't seen the majority of these films."
"There goes my free time.The one for Her was a good choice. Surprised to not see anything from Ran.Has anyone collected these into a single source to downloaded love to add these to my own collection highres backgrounds. No Godfather?"
"But thank you anyway."
":)You must have a lot of monitorsI love the Rushmore one. Mostly because that stadium is right down the street from where I live.That lawnmower scene in Sinister still gives me chillsThis is great. I did a search for some of my favorites, one of which being The Royal Tenenbaums. Interesting choice...I feel if I used it as the background on my work computer I might be asked a few concerned questions.Very cool collection!"
"Do you have a link to a .zip of all them? :DI would love to download these, but Imgur won't let me :(Surprised by the choice of Pulp Fiction cap.  I was expecting the cliche say what again. Well done OPThe Batman Begins one had me on my back.Commenting to save for when I get home. These are awesome. Thanks for putting them together.Surprised The Great Gatsby wasn't the night sky shot from Gatsby's background story. Loving all the Kubrick and Lynch. Good taste OP.would love to see co-workers expression when they walk by your desk and see the Werewolf Women of the SS shot proudly displayed on your screen...Nice pictures, but how were they taken? There's so much HDCP crap in the way that as far as I can see you pretty much have to rip a blu-ray just to take a screenshot.You're the manYou have quite the collection! My personal favorites are the 2001 stills you posted. I used two stills from the movie for a custom skin for my Surface 2: http://imgur.com/a/UTDjcI had an All About Lily Chou-Chou still as my background for a while.  Incredible movie, and beautifully shot, I wish it got more love.Anyone got an HD still if Godzilla blowing blue fire into that other monsters mouth from the new movie? Surprised The Fall and There Will Be Blood were not on hereThese are really awesome! I'm especially loving the two from *In the Mood For Love*. Thanks!How often do you change your background...I have a folder of about 2,000 images that sets a new background every three minutes.How do you do this?Easier to show this [link](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/create-a-desktop-background-slide-show) than to type out.Thanks, didn't realize windows would do this ha!It's a wonderful feature. I do the exact same thing he does. Be careful doing this with some [images](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--kXCpeYnX--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/yuirae9xnearsuh2qzh7.jpg). Well I have a new prank to do on my fellow whovians computers.Photobucket is dumb, but there's an [entire album of Weeping Angel-themed wallpapers](http://s1141.photobucket.com/user/snakew2001/library/Doctor%20Who%20-%20Weeping%20Angels?sort=3&page=1) for you to choose from! Well, if you consider five images to be an entire album. It's probably even more fun if you include all five. How do I do this?"
"Does Windows let you do this or do you have to download an app?Is there anyway you can share that folder with your fellow redittors? Great pics, by the wayOh, coolPlot twist: I will use this as a source of Movies To See.Maybe it's just because I'm on mobile - but it would seem like you posted screenshots from the DVDs not BD as well as in a resolution lower than 1080p.  If so - then what's the point? Otherwise , I'll just have to look when I get home Only surprise was not seeing any stills from *The Secret Life of Walter Mitty*, since that had amazing cinematography in the same style as some of these images. Otherwise, love the collection. Oh how embarrassing. I have seen a mere 11 of those films."
"I should watch more films. Pretty tantalizing collection. Personally would add some Lebowski, Watchmen and Tron, but great lot.This is a stunning collection! Thanks for sharing.Wow these are awesome ,Thanks!wow. these are really excellent.That is excessive.  How do you even get them to all fit at the same time?A 512 K pixel monitor - approximately 18 feet from corner to corner.Thanks OP! Great pictures. Is there any way I can download them in one file?"
"What an awesome collection! I was a bit surprised not to see some stills from Troy though!Comment to save Is there any way to get my desktop background to cycle through these on it's own? Like a screensaver...?Mac or PC? PC, Windows Vista. I found a program called WallPaper Master but I was curious if there was a setting already on Vista that would do this?Not sure about Vista, a quick google search would would probably tell you though.  I know on windows 7, however, you simply right click the background and click personalize.  From there the options are pretty self explanatory!I think you can point the screen saver at a folder and click random.  Not 100% sure.  You can on OS X I'll try that. Thank you.There is an option in windows (I believe it existed in Vista..) that tells Windows to change your desktop background every x minutes. It uses your My Pictures folder.I find your lack of Hugo disturbing. Otherwise that was an awesome album! Very good choices, I like you. Lots of movies people should add to their watchlist.Wow the Finding Nemo Jellyfish are beautiful. I was searching for movie stills to print on canvas to decorate my house. I'll definitely use some of these, thanks.Yup. Keeper. Good on you OPAmazingawsome!I did not enjoy 2046, but these stills make me want to give it another shot.Mine used to be the final scene from Heat. It's an amazing shot. You could use any still from the fall and have yourself a wallpaper.Upvotes for apocalypse now.Some amazng images. Will add some of those as my desktop for sure. Not super stoked about using the swastika though. Might not go down well at work.It's too bad none of these will work as phone backgrounds The Deer Hunter still is an interesting one. I love it, because it is a great film, and it is a great shot. But there is always that part of me that hates those hunting scenes because they were clearly not shot in Pennsylvania as the story suggests. But what a brilliant shot.Great pictures, well organized, and a great taste in film, too! Thanks OP!When I clicked this I thought Wouldn't it be great if he had that shot from Faust. But that'll never happen. But it did!  OP is fantastic!Slowly browsed to D and was shocked not to see Drive, so I rushed all the way to O to check OP had included Only God Forgives... Well done OPI'm going to be that guy. Can someone run a script and crop these to 16:9?Upvoting and saving. Thanks!Thank you very much for sharing. I'll need to snag a bunch of these, as well as check out some of these films I really should've seen by now.Upvoted simply because of the variety of movies. Sad to see that The Conformist isn't up there though.Calvary was beautifully shot. I don't know if it's the right way to describe it, but often they filmed these beautiful, wide open, Irish landscapes. It gave it something menacing."
"But OP, the shot you choose was great too. All that white in an almost empty room...very related to the character Brendan Gleeson plays.I loved this post and have been wanting to gather some stills for myself.  Take a look at Beasts of the Southern Wild for some amazing stills.  That film sticks out to me even though I only saw it once and that was two years ago.I love you.I just came harder than I ever have before in my life.I'm kind of put off by the fact that there's nothing from Hero and like 90% of the movie is just stuff people thought would be cool desktop backgrounds with Jet Li doing wire-fu in front of it. [Frinstance](http://www.wallcoo.net/movie/hero/m01/1HERO_WP1024_018.jpg)sweet! will download when I get home!Love the TV inclusions as well.I would add some stills from Memento and The Fountain, myself. This gallery is goddamn gorgeous though, definitely using some of these. Thanks, OP! this is a post I cannot loadYou're a boss dude. this is a post i cannot loadThank you.So glad to see *I Saw the Devil*. I loved some of the shots in that movie. Also, those two Kill Bill ones are great, as well as the Inglorious Basterds.It's funny to see Firefox crashing every time it gets to 2.4 GB of RAM viewing this page. Not so funny when I'm trying to download everything :(Ida is great. Agata Trzebuchowska's silent moments in the film are captivating. It'd would be great if some could separate the films into separate albums."
"Great post, thanx.No love for Star Trek?"
"I mean The Motion Picture, The Wrath Of Khan, Undiscovered Country, Generations, First Contact, Nemesis and the two new films are wonderfully shot."
"I mean I think [this](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20060705184552/startrek/images/c/c8/Nexus.jpg) (in  a higher res) would be a wonderful addition (from Generations) Thank you so much for this! I've been waiting for a post like this!Must watch many movies now.I love that Clockwork Orange shot, even made a [papercut from it once.](http://i.imgur.com/xNzzCDY.jpg)Never knew stills alone could make me so interested in a movie. It's a beautiful collection OP! You have an eye for picking those moments. Give [Utopia](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-07/11/utopia-channel-4/viewgallery/336688) a try.Absolutely love these! Keep it up! I love updating my movie desktop background folder.Hoping that someone would pls make a list of these movie titles!I've never hit 'save' so fast.some of these are creepy"
"Really surprised there's none from The Fall (2006), that would fit right in with these.nice collection!Thanks! I have lots of new movies to check out :)my internet connection sayis: nopeGreat post! Thank you!I was waiting for fight club but it wasn't there :(Honestly this is a fantastic collection of imagery, just going through them I realised I have so many films I know of that I still need to see, but also some I've not heard of before. Thank you and great work on putting in captions for the film titles. AKA: movies with great cinematography Does anybody have a high-def of Binary Sunset from A New Hope?The amount of movies on this list that I don't recognize makes me feel bad about myself.OP has an excellent taste in moviesGreat work, thanks a lot !great work, thanks a lot !he Elm Street Wall scene is awesome, some of the 2001 stills are beautiful, but what takes the cake for me: ALIEN!"
"Great stills, name of movies, good quality, I agree with everyone who said we need more posters of your kind :)RIP mobile bandwidth capI love the choices of Japanese titles, but I'm sure that there's more Pale Flower to be had. OP, are you holding out on us?Wow! So many of these will be added to my wallpaper collection!Hey hey, look at OP and his fancy cinemascope monitor."
":PNice to see Calvary on here.Now i'm curious about that Wuthering Heights movie.So I'm not ashamed to admit I'm a bit of a luddite when it comes to cinema."
"Could someone explain to me the difference between a director, a director of photography and a cinematographer? Like, are they completely different jobs? Excellent post, thank you.Why did I even try to load this on my phone...these are all really nice but... all the jaw-droppingly incredible images in Baraka and you chose just that one? SMHAs someone with a 21:9 monitor, thanks!What a great collection, thanks!Are these BluRay screenshots?Really Awesome collection OP.  You could also get some sweet stills from the The Fall (2006)Very cool!!! I'm suprised there is no Amazing Spider-man 2 pics. (The intro, top of the bridge in the afternoon scene) How long did it take to get all these?For the Calvary one, would you not use the bit just a second or so before the one you used? The shot where he is fixing his collar and it says 'Sunday' across the wall?Incredible work, thanks very much for posting this! I've made off with a few dozen."
"Are you a film student? Perhaps specializing in Far East cinema? These will be perfect for my Mac Mini attached to my TV. THANK YOU.Very surprised to see Excision up on that list.Does anyone have an HQ version of that Another Earth desktop?I hate to be that guy but do you happen to have a photo dump to download all?I love to add these to my own collection highres backgrounds.Awesome collection with great credit posts too.  10/10 will definitely come back!I like that you have a really wide variety of movies here (and I like most of the ones I've seen). Excluding the most widely viewed and well-known ones, which would you recommend as your favorites?Wait, Fight Club didn't make the cut?By the way, that film captures site seems prone to crashing. It died on me twice.Cool idea.I was hoping to see some Melancholia stills. I know reddit has a dislike of Lars Von Trier but it was a beautiful movie with lots of great imagery.The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is one of the most underrated films ever in my opinion. It's unbelievably good. This is wonderful!"
"Wow OP must be rich.  I only have one computer.Throw some Inception in there bro!Thanks OP! It's now my background slideshow!...These are awesome, but I sure wish more of them were 1920x1080!"
"If anyone uses a 1920x1080 dual monitor display, these are the Studio Ghibli wallpapers that I rotate every 5 minutes: http://imgur.com/a/wlrbRReally nice collection! You should see Lars von Trier's *Melancholia*, it has some really nice shots, especially towards the end Prometheus is a succession of desktop wallpaper.that site film captures is not working for me. is that happening to anyone else?Every time I see that earaserhead guy I just think how great John C. Riley would be for a remake lol.Wonderful diversity of films you've got there.Something tells me you'd appreciate the film Take Shelter.Thank you!My internet connection's reaction when I asked it to load the imgur page: http://imageshack.vayagif.com/img538/237/tXRWHP.gif"
"I have been looking for a good shot of 'Revolver', the endscene in the neon-blue room. I'd be eternelly gratefull to anyone who happens to have a shot like this."
"Beautiful album, got myself some wallpapers out of it too![Stalker (1979)](http://imgur.com/vQtng8Y)Me as a good wallpaper enthusiast I have to say this is the best post on reddit in a LONG time"
"good job guy!Thank you so much for this post! Many of those films look really interesting. I was especially drawn towards *Hana and Alice*, *Faust* and *Ida* :)Surprised not to see more Roger Deakins, Wally Pfister, and Jeff Cronenweth!"
"I feel like especially the latter two have styles that lend themselves particularly well to wallpapers, but I guess I'm free to make my own album to show that."
"Plus, Skyfall. Freaking *Barry Lyndon*, man. Though flawed on some levels that flick was so well shot and stunning--*STUNNING I SAY!*"
"[TIL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Lyndon#Cinematography) to film the interior shots without electrical lighting, Kubrick got NASA used Carl Zeiss [lenses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_Planar_50mm_f/0.7) with a freaking 0.7 f-stop, the lowest used for a movie in forever-ever.Anyone able to make a list of cinematographers?No Yimou Zhang movies? He is without a doubt one of the premier cinematographic directors around.[r/filmmakers](http://www.reddit.com/r/filmmakers) would likely appreciate this too!"
"Awesome collection. Real nice collection. Thanks for sharing!There are so many better captures from Lawrence of Arabia. Those shots of the desert are spectacular and offer so much negative space for icons. Oh no! I didn't see any Takeshi Kitano!"
"Amazing collection btw. I'm going to steal some of these screencaps. Found a lot of films I haven't seen yet and reminded me to do so.Hey OP! You'll enjoy some stills from the movie The Fall. Look it up! :) Fantastic cinematography.You are the bestdude, impeccable.Commenting to save for laterSome of these are fantastic!Bookmarked. Fantastic job. Thanks!Thank you so much:)I should watch many of these movies that I haven't seen, but glad you posted some stills from The New World.  Not enough people have seen that film and it is incredible. Thank you /r/mimurph1! If I had the money for gold I would buy you some round about now.Thanks for the great collection. There are so many films I want to see.[Orfeu Negro](http://heliotricity.com/images/orfeu_negro/orfeu_negro%20450x322.jpg)Wonderful Op! Thankyou very much!AwesomeGood post.Felt bad upvoting from 3790 .This is great!  A lot of these I haven't seen before so thanks for helping me with a movie list."
"You should check out Valhalla Rising sometime, I think there would be a lot of shots in that you might like.i would give you 100.000 upvotes if I could.YES. OP, you rule. These are gorgeous!That first shot of 2001......I screen-capped that EXACT same frame and had it as my desktop background for a long time, because for me it holds the key to the entire film. I'm curious, do you see something there too?They're all very beautiful stills, but I'm confused at the kind of person who'd have a torture scene as their desktop.Downloading all the 2001 stills since there aren't any Interstellar stills of the black hole...yetKubrick was such a genius Personally, i think when albums get so large they become unwieldy and fatiguing. This would have been better divided up into 4 or 5 posts submitted over a couple of weeks."
"But that's my opinion.damn good stills op1. You have a good eye."
"2. How frickin' often do you change your desktop background?!Saved for laterNeeds more *Barry Lyndon*.Bittersweet Life and Battle Royale are both really good. I'm only partway through the list but I wanted to say that before I forget and leave work without commenting.3790 points and 379 comments while I'm ritning this, so weird.Thank you for reminding me of many good movies, and showing me many more i hadn't seen. I highly appreciate that :) Great stills!I would use some of these backgrounds, but the only film I've seen on this list is Psycho. I don't want someone questioning my wall paper choice and judging me for not having seen the movie, even though nobody will ever see my home PC desktop background. Very surprised not to see the girl in the red coat on this listMy CO before but I could read 200 :D"
"I opened this on my phone. I will be sending you the bill OP ;) Would be great if I didn't have a square monitor. :("
"Thanks anyway OP, I'll stick with blue."
"Solid blue. MmmmmmVery nice! I chuckled at the thought of arranging my desktop's icons around those lounging guys in the Barry Lyndon image!Amelie would have some gorgeous ones!  Wish I knew how to do this with my fave movies :)Great collection, but I must say, you like some violent backgrounds.Wow, that's only 6 away from 1 photo per day! Awesome! You would appreciate the very final shot of FuryThese are awesome! I loved the Mel Brooks. History of the World Pt. 1 is severely underrated. I now have a new background!Wow thanks for the new background ! U da man You know, if I was walking by and noticed that your background was a picture of a disembodied head, I would probably continue walking, somewhat faster than I was before.Where da titties at?Mmm look into [Road to Perdition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZphC0_XpDp4) my favorite scene was the shootout  in the rain.  The whole movie is eye candy.The stills from Into The Wild are so perfect, thanks OP Saving this for later. You have Eva in here, that makes me happy.Commenting to saveit's nice to see some love for a field in england in there. if any of you are reading this and haven't seen it, please check it out.Holy cow, so many obscure movies.Thank You.I know this may be the wrong place to ask but is anyone else having problems downloading the album?Some of these stills are blurry. I just don't get it.couldn't you find 400? you're killing me over hereThank you good Sir/Ma'am i have used over 70 of these! The bundle download won't send me the pictures. :("
"Can anybody help me out?RIP BrowserMan, i'd forgotten how beautiful 2001: A Space Odyssey was.Great post. Oh yeah..."
"Batman Begins"
"Cinematographer: Wally Pfister"
"Just sayin*saved*These are great!!!"
"Fantastick work Op, keep up the good work!!my favorite is from The Royal Tennembaums. I love the DegeerlingLimited too. Two other Germanfilms to add would be Run Lola Run and The Princess and The Warrior. Both starring Franka Potente coincidentally. At first I thought you were using the stills to tell a story, kind of like a flip book, where the pics had a plot with a beginning middle and end. Then I thought that is a really good idea. So thanks for giving me the idea for my next project. whoa guys, click the middle mouse button(scroll wheel) and automatically scroll at a moderate speed and stare at the center of the images as they pass. i thought it was neat.Saving for laterNoiceIncredible, fantastic post, OP.I love looking through these photos, but is there a way that you can post a link to a zip file with all of them?why do i have to enter my email to download this album on imgur?"
"Wow. That's the essence of cinema. Aesthetically pleasing moving images. Plot, characters, dialog, direction, message are all garnishBookmarkedYou should check out *Valhalla Rising* by Nicolas Winding Refn (director of Drive) and cinematographer Morten Soborg."
"Amazing still shots and seriously every still could serve as a background :DNicely done. This compilation would make a great photography book.How many times do you change your background OP!?Movies, thanksFantastic but sad to see no stills from 'Dark City'.  It must have taken you a hell of a time to upload those all..I've only gotten through half of the pictures, and just had to comment and say that so far, these are great!http://i.imgur.com/Zl3Uutx.jpg"
"Pink Floyd: The Wall"
"Love all your stills! And thanks for the new lost of movies to see!"
"I highly recommend Confessions to those who haven't seen it. Commenting to save for when I get homeGreat compilation, FB cover photos for a whole year! Only thing lacking was more Grand Budapest Hotel stills!!needs more lord of the rings! Thanks will be usingHiI'm going to have to say the third shot in of Dullea traversing the capsule with Stanley's breathing accompanying the movement may very well by my favorite scene out of all the movies I've ever seen.I just watched The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, such a well filmed, beautiful movie. Cinematography is amazing. Im surprised you didn't put up anything from that movie OP. Also, i went thru and tried to add as many of these i could on my list to watch on Netflix. Thanks OP, your the hero we need! One scene I'd like to add to this collection is [this scene in Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince](http://imgur.com/Geh7qm2)"
"Edit: [This scene too](http://imgur.com/3ScEmdT)Other than the scary lack of diversity, good job on the sources and titles.Some gorgeous stills, though I recognize less than half of the movies. Would be great if there were a complete list of the films these are from. I also use movie stills for my desktop background. Was not disappointed to find some overlap with what we use."
"Since you also seem to like Malick, may I suggest To the Wonder? There are some magical sights in that thing.Thanks for the great stills, I'm currently using the Nightmare on Elm street one.I wish my phone could load more than 10.  :(Are any of these images NSFW?"
"I want to set them up as desktop wallpapers, but don't want to spoil myself by checking all of them.Does anybody know how to convert a large amount of files from .png to .jpg for free?"
"About 2/3 of these are in a format that doesn't work with this program I have...Somehow i knew Melancholia was going to be on that list. Fucking brilliant movie. You forgot one of the most visually appealing films of all time. Stalker by Tarkovsky, but I presume the lack of a high definition version is the reason for its absence. I just made Hal my desktop. Frozen.... Really? Ugh. I'm sad that the resolution is so low, otherwise I would immediately use those.Do you if imgur reduces quality on every image, despite the size? They seem fine when viewing on my desktop, but I noticed after uploading more than a few looked less than satisfactory. I thought the image limit prior to compression for a pro account was 5 MB, most of the images started out at 1 to 4 MB. Oh well, I had fun gathering these anyway.seems that even from filmcaptures the quality isnt that high for me. it would be nice if you can choose different resolutions as well but i realize that's asking too much as they're movie stills and not a wallpaper websiteCan u upload the folder elsewhere?I like how True Detective is so good that it doesn't matter that its not a movie. Rust is the man.HOLY SHIT THATS A LOT OF STILLSMight want to be careful with that Werewolf Women of the SS one. Out of context you just look like a Nazi. @oneperfectshot on twitter? Barry Lyndon shot looks like a painting. Totally think this awesome. Comment for future use.I am particularly fond of [this image](http://imgur.com/JMAfVH1.jpg) from StalkerNice selections.  ON A SIDE NOTE, **Babel** was a pretentious bore.  I did not enjoy that movie at all.  I understood the message within the first 20 minutes.  Why did it have to keep punishing us with what is basically the same story retold with different characters for the next 2 hrs?  It's like watching the worst **Three's Company** episodes back to back on loop, you know, the ones where everyone misunderstood what someone else was saying and everything could have been solved it they just sat down and explained everything.  It was like watching someone masturbate repeatedly while he/she told us how important orgasms are to him/her.  I got it the first time, pal."
"edited for clarityOP never claimed any of these movies are good or bad, they're just showing off great cinematography. The quality of the film itself is irrelevant.I'm not saying the OP said that they were good or bad.  This is an entirely separate thought I am bringing up. Your use of the word 'but' suggests otherwise. If you'd left that out what you're saying now would make sense, but still, the rant seemed a little out of nowhere. I'm not a fan of Babel but there's 379 stills from a couple hundred movies, seems bizarre to just start ranting about one of those movies. Why not focus on a movie you enjoyed more?**That's** how strongly i feel about Babel.  Thanks for the heads up, I suppose."
"140 up-close photos of ship and vehicle models constructed by ILM for the Original Star Wars Trilogy (1977-1983)I know they did what is called kit bashing where they built these using parts from other off-the-shelf plastic models such as cars, tanks, navy ships, etc. but no matter how much I study these close-ups I can never see any part that I recognize. Truly amazing.Awesome, even better than starting from scratch!I think they should do this for Episode 7.Want some craziness?  The Y-Wing's engine fronts, those semi ovoid spheres?  Those are plastic eggs like you can get at easter.They did it for the props, too. The grill on Han's ANH [blaster](http://i527.photobucket.com/albums/cc352/Lichtbote/Props/Blaster/MGC-ANH-Hero/GreedoKiller019.jpg) is a cylinder half from a Hawker Tomtit model plane kit, as are the antenna like details on the top of the barrel right behind the flash hider. That cylinder part was used on many SW props, including Greedo's blaster, Imperial officer blasters (Merr-Sonn Power 5) Leia's ANH and ROTJ blaster, and the vibro axes used by the Gamorrean guards in Jabba's palace. And that's just one part from one kit.know what the crazy thing is? for some of these models fans have tracked down and cataloged every single piece and what full model they come from. it's insane.There are a whole bunch of panzer tank exhausts all over the Millennium Falcon.You're right! And i actually enjoy trying to spot the few that i can catch. It makes the whole movie feel like it was made by real people instead of just an algorithm in a big render farm.i didn't realize that. that is incredibly freaking coolIt's like Lego's on crack. This is the most impressive thing I've ever seen; especially when you consider the intricate details of everything and the fact it's straight from their own imagination. When I sat back and actually *thought* about it, it's something you just don't see anymore. Now I know why my dad always loved building things so much. You have to be incredibly impressed with yourself after something like that and the imagination it involved."
"That's friggin' amazing.I'd want to see my work blown up too. Seriously, I think that would be really cool. There's a T-34 turret in this series which appears to be somewhere on the Rebel frigate model.. also a couple of submarine conning towers. In other pictures I've run into I could see a ton of tank bits on the X-wing and Y-wing fighters... the Y-wing incorporates most of a Tiger's engine cover into its rear fuselage iirc.There's maybe a couple of V8 engine heads stuck either side, right at the front of the Millennium Falcon. There's also a few outlet ports tacked along the top of it"
"edit [here's](http://i.imgur.com/5ldhVZF.jpg) what I mean."
"The block is not attached, we're looking from underneath the heads. You can see what looks like exhaust ports and the ribbed castings to support attachment of the cam covers. This is not the same engine, the one I found an image of is a Ford DFV (i think!), it's just for referenceYou can see that looks like transmissions on the side of the falcon too.What's great about this method is that it utilizes shapes that come from the real world, which means they are realistic-looking and recognizable on a subconscious level.  We may not be able to identify them, but some part of our brain says, Yeah, I'm familiar with these shapes.  This makes sense.  This is real.Adam Savage/Tested did a video about kitbashing, he even mentions a few popular kits."
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKRG6amACEEGreat video, thank you for sharing!It also has a great anecdote about a memorable Blade Runner scene, in case people were wondering if it was worth the bother."
"Edit: watching this reminds me of my years reading SFX. I wonder if that magazine still exists. I have quit that industry for so long I'm utterly out of touch. Watched the vid (thanks for posting). At some point as he was describing how he hand-carved the nose of the y-wing, I realized that it's not harder to make models, today, it's actually easier - but it is a different skillset."
"He said I hand carved this nose piece or something. I though well, maybe I could make one, but I'd have to use a 3D printer..."
"So that's it in a nutshell.  But what's interesting about that, is that it's the CG skillset, because CG can be made reality now, much easier than it used to be - this really is something new in the last 20 years (since he was making models for a living)."
"I guess the good takeaway from this isn't that models have died for practical effects (at least, died the way Adam made them) but that models can be made easier/faster/better by employing 3D models, etc. -- this may actually give more/better life to practical effects... I'm hoping, anyway."
"**edit** interesting - i'm still watching and he said that he was given 3D models of the matrix piece, and then he extrapolated them and built each piece to assemble. He did it his old way! (though, I have to imagine they use 3D printers today -- this was still slightly before the 3D printer revolution).I think there is something to be said for creativity through limitations. Those models were built by guys picking up random bits of repurposed plastic details and just seeing what fit well and looked cool. Can you imagine creating that kind of detail from scratch? No happy accidents where you couldn't find the right shape and tried something else only to realize it looked better that way. I actually came here to mention that it's interesting how many pieces you can identify when you have this up-close view. A few examples:"
"* The Shield Generators on the Star Destroyer are radar domes, probably from a model city or train set. Maybe a scale navy ship."
"* The tips on the Millennium Falcon (the tips of the U split at the front) are capped with engine block pieces."
"* The backs of the laser cannons on the Snow Speeder seem to be off the front of a WW2 era propeller plane (think the front but without the propeller attached, not sure about this one though)"
"* The surface of the Super Star Destroyer (the city part) seems to use ship decks and tank pieces as a base. Probably leftovers whose detail parts were salvaged for other models."
"* Like the rear tower on the Nebulon B Frigate, which seems to be a T-34 tank turret."
"* The top front of the Nebulon B Frigate is the tower off a Submarine. (The smaller tower right at the front of the narrow bit, the rest of the Sub may be in there too)"
"* The feet on the AT-ST are tank turrets. Probably from a Tank Destroyer."
"There's more that I couldn't identify or weren't sure about. :)Tank turrets and submarine bodies are used heavily if you look closely. I see an obvious tank turret on the frigate.  My guess would be from a M41 Walker Bulldog kit.You're right, I noticed [this one](http://i.imgur.com/OYHUEAR.jpg) which I believe is from the Medical Frigate really looks like the top of a submarine.It's an older model, but it checks out.You can't see it in these photos, but many of the things sticking out of the medical frigate are ship hulls.Looks like brake rotors on bottom middle.  kinda cool.Sides of an engine block on the TIE fighter closeup of the inside solar wing.That picture also looks to have a similar section of submarine below it as well."
"[This picture](http://i.imgur.com/ma0lvMP.jpg) shows a turret from a M46 Patton tank.  I see what may be half a fuel tank below it and what I think is a machine gun mount on a tank.The bottom right section of that photo looks like a assistant gunner turret on a the front of a tank as well; how fucking cool.Image 23 i can see an automobile transmission and also a sherman tank wheelmountIt makes you wonder how many total kits they had that contributed to all the models they made and how many more are/were sitting in bins in ILM.I'm wondering what kind of records and cataloging they have. Do they keep detailed notes so they can rebuild if one gets broken?In either an episode of Mythbusters or in one of the Tested.com podcasts, Adam Savage who used to work at ILM said there is a room completely filled with a staggering amount of bins and boxes of model kits.i can picture the Tamiya sales rep for Marin County in his mansion sleeping on a pile of cash and naked womenThese are amazing! The detail is freakin' crazy. Thanks for sharing! What would that MF model be worth in a collection?And I thought the Lego sets were neat.Can you imagine these??? I bet these were so much fun to build These just make me want to watch the originals again.  I'll go break out the VHS someone make popcorn.Hell yeah! I'll have to go across town for popcorn... totally worth it.Especially amazing is all the jpeg artifacts they built into the models.For the most part yes, but that one ship was just a hunk of junk!it's out of this worldWhat an amazing time to have been alive and in the world of movie making.It's.... [FALCON CRAZY!](http://imgur.com/BjqzoPs)Piggybacking off of this, I do have a question: while these look amazing and incredibly detailed, they still look like handmade models in the pics.  What kind of effects were used to give them more of that realistic look in the films? I have a feeling lighting, camera movement, and post-coloring all played a role in giving it the push it needed to increase the realism. I'd love to know for sure as well though, because I agree with you. There is still something missing in the pics.I'm wondering if there's even more than that; like the type of film used, maybe certain lenses, etc.serious question, how does the cockpit in the millenium falcon make any goddamn sense? you cant see half of what is going on on the other side of the shipI really think it's just the [rule of cool](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool) in action. The artist who designed it thought it would look good over there, so it's over there, with no consideration for whether or not that would be practical."
"Rather like the Death Star's lack of railings on walkways (or the number of massive, indoor caverns in the first place). Or AT-ATs. Or manually piloted ships in a universe with sentient robots. And so forth. A lot of *Star Wars* doesn't *really* make any sense.Touche, well saidRule of Cool"

"*I am a bot. [Here is my sub](http://reddit.com/r/autotrope)*No wonder Luke called it a piece of junk.I would imagine that in space, flying has very little to do with what you can see with your eyes and more with what your sensors show. For the rest I am sure it is like driving any big vehicle, you get used to it. For a freighter that was never supposed to engage in combat, you really only need to see forward for docking. Sensors all around would give proximity for the saucer side of the ship."
"In combat it's impractical, but one is ideally still always flying in a fairly straight line and having the gunners do the work."
"Lando is a super-ace to be able to fly it inside the second Death Star.Really puts the maneuvering during the asteroid scene in ESB and the death star run in ROTJ into perspective."
"Lol! I never thought of that, until now. It makes no sense honestly. The same way that tank drivers can drive despite being incapable of seeing anything on the other side of the tank.  There are digital aids to make up for the lack of sight."
"That space between the prongs is for loading cargo, presumably there's some sort of camera system in the middle to aid in docking to load said cargo, so it's not an unreasonable assumption that there's other visual aids in the cockpit.it's interesting to think that the range of their 'technology' in the falcon was limited to the effects of the 1980s. It will be interesting to see how they update the existing technology Hopefully not the same way they updated Star Trek.  while the Applestore in Space look works for that universe, it's not so much for Star Wars.Totally agree, Star Wars always felt a bit less refined in terms of how it approached its future technology. I wonder how it would translate into modern aesthetics for cinema.>a little less refined"
"Probably because it's a long time ago...With ships that big, you don't rely on visuals much anyway. The same goes for bigger aircraft in real life. I mean, of course you do use visuals, but in bad visual conditions (heavy fog, rain, etc.) it's necessary for pilots to rely completely on sensors to tell their speed, altitude, bearing, etc...I'd imagine the same goes for the Falcon.In any ship you pilot, there's going to be a whole lot of ship between you and a large portion of the sky. X-wing? Can't see below you. Tie Fighter? Can't see behind you. Falcon? Can't see to the left. So logically, there are sensors that detect where a ship or small moon is relative to your location."
"By the way, that's no small moon.I thik it was meant to be piloted by 2 or more people... It does not make sense. But it still looks wickedI looked on wookiepedia hoping I might find an  answer, but I didn't so I'm going to just say it has fuck tons of sensors to assist with flight. I did find this which I thought was interesting:"
">Like the rest of the YT series, it featured a saucer-shaped hull with external cockpit. The YT-1300 came in three different configurations: a port-mounted cockpit, a starboard-mounted cockpit, and a centrally mounted cockpit (the latter of which became standard in the YT-1930 design).So basically Lando bought (won? stole?) the crappy version of a ship for cheap."
"One more possible explanation:  You don't see an enemy ship until it's very close to you, and on such a small ship, sensors won't be able to detect where the pilots are.  So most shoot toward the center of the ship which (in a real bind) might help the pilot / flight instruments from getting damaged.  While certainly not practical, it does allow some view to the left the way it's situated. I imagine sensors would be used pretty heavily in advanced space flight. There are also the gun turrets which have a pretty big FOV."
"I imagine the rationale would have been aesthetic design. This ship was designed as a civilian freighter, not a military vessel.If I remember correctly, the cargo bay door is on the starboard side of the ship with the cockpit. With this design you can see where you're docking much more easily."
"EDIT: You'd think that the Star Wars-obsessed son of a naval officer would know which side of the *Falcon* the cockpit's on. The cockpit is on the starboard, but I'll assume you mean they are on the same side, to facilitate docking.I remember the Falcon was flyable in one of the Rougue Squadron games and cockpit view was near impossible. You would always be bashing into everything.Folks manage to blow up the death star in [X Wing Alliance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP_hBH7cH4M)!"
"edit: Death Star IIHoly crap, this mission took me probably 20 tries, before I realized there was a bug that was preventing me from finishing it. Patched it and awesomeness was had.It took a lot of tries, but I managed to complete the Death Star II mission in the cockpit view of the Falcon.Pics or it didn't happenYou're very welcome. Even though miniatures and models are still a part of movie-making today, you just don't see this kind of work done anymore.Now let's not forget doing this with CGI also takes some effort. At least 4 mouse-clicks for this amount of detail. Maybe even 10."
"/sRight-click, Add kibble... 75%. That's to much."
"Ctrl-Z, right-click, Add kibble... 65%. Break time!Greeble all the things.Ahh another 'practical effects' circlejerk begins.Yup."
"But I can always tell it's CGI and it's always shitty."
"You ******. You can see it's because it's crappy. The countless times you saw good CGI you didn't even notice there were VFX.I'd begrudgingly agree. I remember watching Cast Away with the commentary on, and I was shocked by how much CGI was used in the film that you'd never have known wasn't real."
"That said, they bungled the whale visits Chuck on the raft scene when the whale goes back under water and the water doesn't displace or move at all. It's like they just faded the whale out and called it good.The goblin king in the hobbit is fantastic work, but is still far from convincing. There is a lot of CGI we don't notice, but the practical effects circlejerk isn't unfounded. Use the tools best suited for the job. Plenty of movies still use miniatures here and there, often in tandem with CG. Some examples off the top of my head: Batman Begins used models for the rooftop segment of the Batmobile chase scene([1](http://i155.photobucket.com/albums/s319/propceeper/dTb.jpg),[2](http://i155.photobucket.com/albums/s319/propceeper/dTb2.jpg)), and the 2009 Star Trek used ~1:2 scale for some of the larger sets, with the children in costume standing in for the characters. I hate CGI... everything is Who Framed Roger Rabbit now. Not often enough at the least. At times the results are better than CGI> ...you just don't see this kind of work done anymore."
"Actually you do."
"You might want to try Resin Illuminati, or RPF. I am an active member of both forums. Bet 3D printing will make this shit crazyImagine how easy it would be to make a squadron of X-Wing fighters if they used 3D printers! Too bad they didn't exist back then.With how much detail and work they had to put into making not only the original models, but all the copies they inevitably needed and keeping the models from breaking, I can kind of understand why CGI is so heavily preferred now. It's still a lot of work in its own right, but it can't possibly rival the intensity of this."
"Extremely thankful for all the dedication they put into this project. I think there may be a lot more man hours put into a blockbuster using CGI now than there ever was in the Star Wars ep4 days. Take a look at the credits at the end of a film now and compare it to one from the 70s. There is a reason films are so expensive. Plus, viewer expectations are so much higher!What happened to those pieces? Are they in a museum or some rich guy's private collection?Last time I saw that amount of detail was the LoTR behind the scenes documentary. Something tangible is always better, imo. I so wanted that to be my career. Stupid CGI. R.I.P. conventional models that look amazing and complete a sense of reality.This is quite possibly my least favorite circlejerk on reddit."
"CG visual effects have been equal or superior to traditional methods for well over a decade for most applications."
"What people complain about is BAD CGI. The majority of the CGI used in modern movies will go completely unnoticed because it is virtually indistinguishable from reality at this point.Agreed. I don't understand why some people act like minatures were the greatest thing and CGI is all bad. In fact, in creating CGI, you'd likely end up creating a virtual model with a similar end result, but it's much easier to undo mistakes, duplicate parts, etc."
"The models that CGI uses don't have the texture restriction that regular models have (where we can only add paint details to a certain level before we need a bigger model)."
"I like how you can see the parts that they glued on from model car kits. Like all the shock absorbers around the Doppler radars. And the transmission casing (I think from an old Ferrari) on the side of the MF. The original *Star Wars* was shot under a tight schedule and budget, and Lucas *et al* were forced to improvise a lot. To make the star destroyer, they bought lots of snap-tite military model kits (smallish, beginner-level model kits sold for $2-5 at the time), dumped out all the parts, and sorted them into bulk bins. The basic ship forms were made out of plywood, and all the parts got stuck on. Even in some of the images here, you can see some of the original numbers moulded into the plastic."
"Flashing from those and more advanced kits used was not wasted, either. [Flashing](http://www.scalemodelguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Sprues.jpg) (also called sprue) is all the bits of plastic that aren't part of the model, but hold it all together before you start. (It allows entire model kits to be moulded all at once, as one piece of plastic, for efficient mass production.) Flashing is mostly sticks and slim little panels, which find endless use in original modelling. (You already paid for it, so why not use it? Need antennas? Here's half a dozen, all ready to go.)"
"There's some subtle humour in here, too. It's not hard to spot the submarine on one of the models here, though it would have been all but invisible in the film. The second Death Star included things like tiny lawn furniture."
"This approach to makeshift modelling was lampooned brilliantly in *Team America: World Police,* where damn near *everything* in the sets is a found object, if you look closely enough."
"The Nebulon-B model is just great. Are those a Panzer IV turret and a submarine sail?"
"She always was my favourite SW ship.Those are the shield generators on the Star Destroyer.There's some decent evidence that, at time of filming, they were intended to be radar/scopes/etc. But thanks to some merchandise in between ESB & ROTJ....shield generators.I think what fed that, was in ROTJ, the Executor's dome gets shot up by and A-Wing, and it immediately cuts to the bridge crew saying their bridge deflector shield is down.Oh I should have remembered sooner: [Star Wars Technical Commentaries](http://www.theforce.net/swtc/towers.html#globes)Oh yeah?  I never knew that.  It's pretty cool how the whole universe took on a life of its own and evolved.Unfortunately I can't remember where to find the evidence...It doesn't really matter."
"Either you're right, and it's a cool fact, or you're wrong, and it's what we thought before. You made our days a bit more interesting either way. Even better: Remembering: https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2jzplg/140_upclose_photos_of_ship_and_vehicle_models/clgrr5cSorry if you know this already: it is called kit bashing.  Basically going out and buying loads of plastic model kits and using them to detail up new models quickly. Pretty much any movie  miniature from the 60's to now has used this technique to add free detail and complexity. Film miniatures are awesome art!"
"Edit: Oops, I see there is a detailed discussion on this further down the page.Aw, thanks, I couldn't remember the term. I've watched some of the [Tested](https://www.youtube.com/user/testedcom) interviews with Adam Savage where he explained some of his process at ILM and other projects."
"It's probably a career path I would have gone down if I knew about it at the time.How about the kv-1 tank turret?  :)The same happened with a lot of props. The DL-44 has Revell model engine parts.Nice eye on the Ferrari, I couldn't put my finger on the makeAccording to Kevin Smith, Episode 7 is going back to physical mockups and models rather than relying solely on CGI."
"**Edit**: It seems I was wrong about just how much CGI was used in the prequels. I found a thread on theforce.net that proves (with lots and lots of pictures) just how much was done with practical models and sets. Most of the physical shots had CGI work done to them (in fact, according to Wikipedia, only one shot in TPM had no digital alteration) which may account for why people seem to believe that all of the effects, backgrounds, and ships were CGI."
"Thread here: http://boards.theforce.net/threads/the-official-the-phantom-menace-models-and-miniatures-thread.31831106/Not that you'll be able to see anything other than lens flairs...Low-effort shitpost.Wasn't the secret to the timeless nature of Jurassic Park that it only had some 4 minutes of CG animation?  I approve, if this is true.How will people be able to tell the difference?Many people feel, myself included, that the CGI-heavy prequels lacked a depth and richness that is there with physical sets and physical models. When Episode 7 is released, I suspect you'll be able to see and feel a difference. Considering physical sets and models were heavily used in for example Episode I, not so much.jarjar ruined any sort of realness that physical sets tried to convey. also the parts in the desert was really cool.http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20130730-special-effects-get-physical-agai"
"**Edit** - Your insistence that there were a lot of models used in PM prompted me to do some research and I came across this thread which really opened my eyes to the amount of physical work done in that movie. Perhaps the overlay of digital effects with practical backgrounds and models is what caused myself, as well as many others, to assume nothing (or very little) was actually created in the physical realm."
"http://boards.theforce.net/threads/the-official-the-phantom-menace-models-and-miniatures-thread.31831106/Agreed. CGI is icing to the cake. It can make cool lasers and hyperspace effects but physical objects just look better with models because they are real. How do you know? You've probably seen hundreds of CGI models of things you didn't realize were CGI.I dunno, the last Star Trek looked pretty damned amazing with the flybys of the Enterprise where you could look deep into the windows and see crew members walking around inside.There are several shots in all Series since TNG where they accomplish this with models.I suppose that makes sense, to me the two techniques should compliment each other, just just replace one another.How do you make a physical Jar Jar?I don't know this Jar Jar of which you speak. He does not exist in my world.I wish the Jedi that helped you erase that memory could come and do the same for me.There's a new Star Trek movie?I've gotta say though, the space battles in Revenge of the Sith were fucking sweet.Can I be honest here? I literally don't remember a single bit of any of them. However sweet, they apparently weren't very sticky for me. But watching the original assault on the Death Star still gives me chills even now, and I can remember most of it, including whole sequences and much of the dialogue. The original *told a story*. The later ones were just a lot of shit moving around real fast."
"I can see them using physical props for the full-size ships, but I'll honestly be surprised if they go with miniatures over CGI for space battles. CGI is just way more practical and flexible for those situations. In the end the technology is irrelevant. It all depends on the dramaturgy and staging. It just feels  like CGI often leads movie makers astray, and makes them create big useless battles that are totally pointless and boring."
"Let's take for example the battles of episode IV and VI against those of I and the huge one in the beginning of III - the old battles were clearly more meaningful and better staged. The new ones felt so unnatural and set up (especially in episode 1 where a clueless anakin kid wrecks everything...) or just without purpose (episode 3 - nothing interesting about that battle).I call this the DS9 Effect.  There was little CGI in the previous Treks and most episodes involved single ships doing combat or the crew using their guile to avoid it because model making was expensive.  By the end of DS9, making a fleet of CGI ships was cheap and every episode was Defiant vs Every Dominion ship/Every Klingon Ship, etc...[deleted]Yeah, there was a video posted on here a while back about some Stalingrad movie and everyone said it was 'realistic CGI'. One of the scenes was a bunch of guys running up a hill to attack a *currently burning fuel depot*. I pointed out that the heat alone would've made it impossible to approach, their skin would be burning and their uniforms combusting."
"I think CGI has ruined both filmmakers and audiences for different reasons.Point of order! I saw that CGI post for the movie Stalingrad as well, awhile back, and expected it would be a bad, bad film. But it's currently running on my cable (Starz) so I watched it. And actually... it was for me a wonderful film. It's in russian (and german) with english subtitles. The CGI special effects are indeed way over the top in the scene you mentioned and in other subsequent scenes--in fact, all the action, the hand-to-hand fighting in general is very stylized and extreme. But the film itself was surprisingly good. The story was solid, human, interesting and well written. The characters were well drawn and believable. You cared about them, even the german officer. The casting was great. And the acting was excellent. I would say the direction must have been quite good because everyone was believable and real. It offers an interesting Russian view of a horrific WWll battle seldom bothered about in the U.S., based on historic fact--[Pavlov's House](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavlov%27s_House)--where a platoon of russian soldiers and some civilians held out against the germans in a single apartment block in the besieged city for two months. I might even be willing to guess that the ridiculous charge through the flaming fuel dump could be based on some modicum of historical truth? The film at times has the feel of a Golden Age Hollywood classic. There's a scene towards the end where the light from outside plays upon one character's face as she is speaking that is so poignant and beautiful."
"Romanticized? Yes. Baroque in its CGI excess? Yes. And yet a very unexpectedly satisfying historical war film, if I may say. I know it's popular to shit on the prequels but Phantom Menace utilized physical models pretty extensively, but many still believe it was purely CGI. Regardless, there's something to be said that even with practical effects, the prequels managed to feel like they were all made in front of a green screen."
"Well the original models were made to look used and worn-out.  There's an old interview where Lucas said he wanted the universe to feel lived-in.  Then in the prequels everything looks new and shiny.  And even though it's perfectly possible to make worn-out looking ships using CGI or shiny physical models, maybe people associate the shiny, new look with CGI?>  maybe people associate the shiny, new look with CGI?"
"I'm trying to think - I don't remember any beauty shots of ships in the prequels. What I mean is, a long slow shot where a big ship flies by and it's in focus and you really see it."
"The opening shot of Ep. IV is a good example of what I mean. The blockade runner and then the Star Destroyer fly by and the camera is fixed and you really get a good view of the ship."
"I don't remember seeing any of those in the prequel. Maybe I'm wrong, but what I remember of the capital ships is far away shots, and then super-fast, very short close ups. They're doing those shots in part just because they can - a similar shot in pre-CGI days was nigh impossible (the famous RotJ shots are famous in part for the monumental difficulty of creating them) but I'm wondering if they've over done it and lost something in the process.IIRC the term he used was a used future. He complained that everything in sci-fi movies up to that point was shiny and new.If I remember right, they made physical models for a lot of stuff in the prequels, but most of the models were only made so that they could be put into computers easierI don't think the models would fit inside the computer. They had to find a different solution I'm sure.The files are *in* the computer?What is this? A Death Star for ants??but why male modelsAre you serious? I just told youSomething I never really understood is: it's pretty obvious these are models, but when you see them in the movie, they look majestic and very real. What makes them visually different? Camera depth?Your brain does most of the work. Cinematographers are experts in the image language of the brain, and use simple visual cues to instruct your brain what to see and how to interpret it. The biggest secret to their craft is that your brain sees and interprets the world in three dimensions, but film is a two-dimensional medium."
"Here, I'll give you an [example](http://www.badastronomy.com/pix/hoagland/crater_original.jpg) that's amazing both for its simplicity and how hard it is to see it in the way that you *know* is right. You know intuitively that that is a crater, and that craters are concave. But your brain understands what it sees based on experience, and you live on a world where nearly all light comes from above the level of your eyes, so that almost all shadows cast by light are *below* the illuminated object. Based on that experience, your brain *insists* that the shadows here *must* mean this object is *convex* rather than concave -- a bump rather than a hole. [Here](http://www.badastronomy.com/pix/hoagland/crater_flipped.jpg)'s the same exact image, 'right side up'. *Now* your brain sees it as it 'should' be (and really is), as a concave structure."
"In the case of the models you're talking about, cinematographers use a variety of lighting and camera tricks to supply clues to your visual cortex about size, dimension, speed, and so on, that will reliably trigger the same kind of presumptive conclusions by your brain. You 'see' a huge ship, even though you *know* it's a small model. This works because the visual processing part of our brain is a lot more fundamental than the reasoning parts of our brain, such that it mostly ignores what we 'know' and try to tell it that contradicts what it's sure it sees. It takes lots of experience or discipline to overcome that, and filmgoers *want* to be fooled."
"Depth of field (clear focal depth) is one of those gimmicks, and is also the trick behind all the 'tilt/shift' images you see online. In real life, miniatures have a shallower depth of field, and that will be obvious to your eye. A clever photographer changes the depth of field in the miniature shot to mimic what it would be at full size, and your brain is usually fooled by that, at least long enough to give you the intended feel. (The cheaper digital version of that fake-miniature trick is to blur the rational 'foreground' and 'background' zones of the image, to mimic the blurry focus of a shallow depth of field, as you'd normally get while looking at things close up, such as small things.) If you reverse that, you can make small things look bigger than they are. Because film is two-dimensional, your eyes can't independently verify these clues, forcing your visual cortex to rely on experience instead."
"If you'll remember, I explained this whole tilt/shift thing to you a couple weeks ago.  It's not merely depth of field, but actually tilting the plane of focus relative to the plane of the camera back.  Sure, the effect is more prominent if you use a shallow depth of field, but simply using a wide open aperture doesn't give you the same effect."
"I thought you grokked that, because two days later you started haranguing someone else for making the same uninformed mistake."
"Sadly, tonight you've reverted to the pedestrian explanation."
">  If you reverse that, you can make small things look bigger than they are."
"Umm, no.  Different set of techniques entirely."
"If you are going to preach like an expert, please learn the material first.Woah. It works even just rotating your phone 180.Like a lot of the comments cover here. I think it needs the perfect mix to be just right - the motion needs to match the object - so if it is big, it needs to move just right and act like it has mass and _intertia_, it needs to have everything else around it support it's sense of scale (so that is why in the shop they really look like a model!), and lighting and camera position is extremely key. The camera needs to look like it is capturing something of the right scale..."
"Where a lot of older models really _do_ seem to show their age is their internal lighting. Models today have a lot more options open to them for lighting than ever before, compared to the very few back then (basically incandescent lamps, light pipes [coarse plastic fibre optics] and fluorescent lights). Often the lighting when not done well screams model! This is even before you hand off to your VFX team I guess."
"Please note, this is from the point of an enjoyer of movies, who is speaking from his ass...The magic of movie-making.There is a skill to painting something so your eye accepts it as real.  Also they are always in motion so you can't focus too long on any one part.  This helps.I bet the illusion would be partially lost if the models weren't in motion a lot of the time... I think this helps them feel more alive and you can much easily accept them as real, as you mentioned.Could just be the good cinematography coupled with the fact that your so into the movie, that you suspend reality and believe everything you see. It's pretty amazing to think that these models were real and working in our heads when watching the filmsLighting and over/undercranking also contribute to the sense of scale. Not to mention that nowadays, I expect every miniature shop will have a 3D printer."
"Most of the details on those seen here came from regular hobbyist plastic models."
"I'm going to need 130 boxes of Heller's <obscure battleship>, they have a great looking hatch.I love movie models like these. Probably my favorite of all time is the Nostromo from the movie Alien (1979). The thing was massive!"
"http://inverzija.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/12092014_01_alien.jpgYou can often judge the quality of a movie by the models they use.  Star wars is at the top, at the bottom is cheap movies where they just glue sprues to the side of a ship.You leave the Borg out of this!Back in the late 70s/80s there was a place in Buena Park, CA that had old movie cars, props, Rat Fink, Ed Roth hotrods, Robby The Robot, they also had the miniature set of the amusement park and ferris wheel from 1941, I was just a kid, but that thing fascinated me. I always wonder what happened to it."
"That's actually not the *Nostromo*, but the payload it is pulling. [This is a pic of the primary model](http://i192.photobucket.com/albums/z292/djrees_2007/Nos2-1.jpg) used for the *Nostromo* (separated from its payload). The thing is massive!"
"That is the refinery though, not the Nostromo."
"[This](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20131021191259/avp/images/e/ee/USCSS_Nostromo.png) is the Nostromo.Red Dwarf had a [pretty cool model](http://i.imgur.com/IJxZdRp.jpg). Unfortunately, they had to stop using it after it fell off a shelf.> Unfortunately, they had to stop using it after it fell off a shelf."

"My favorite is definitely [The Cygnus](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NXqRnSsc01M/TnusiacTGWI/AAAAAAAAEVU/5gUSaFjM-Nc/s640/BTSBlackHoleSm.jpg) from The Black HoleI love The Black Hole! Despite it being ludicrously silly like asteroids rolling through a ship or people breathing in space, its ship models were amazing! The Cygnus is definitely up there with the Nostromo as far as amazing designs.That engine startup sequence.This is one movie I'd actually love to see a remake on... but if they ever do I hope they leave alone the Cygnus and Maximilian. He was such the perfect villain, I remember being terrified of him as a kid in the movie theater."
"Sure, a big glass ship is probably far fetched, but it was just so... awesome.I also would love a remake and would also wish for them to leave the Cygnus and Max unchanged. Honestly, I recalled hearing that the director of Tron: Legacy was wanting to direct the remake. Haven't heard much since but in Tron: Legacy at the beginning of the movie, you see a Black Hole poster hanging in the kid's room. Clearly a nod towards that possibility. ;)Jesus! And in 2001 it doesn't look any more detailed than the Star Wars models.I'm going to politely disagreeEh, think about how many audiences have been awed by the Star Destroyer flyover in Star Wars vs the flyby in 2001, the Star Wars shot is closer to the model and has more impact.I'm not saying the models in Star Wars are not impressive, and I agree that a larger audience has seen the Star Destroyer flyover, but 2001 pre-dates it by nearly a decade and still looks (in my opinion) more believably real.A lot of the VFX crew on Star Wars had worked on 2001, so it's really down to the design of the ships themselves. 2001 is obviously based on Earth tech way more than SW. Probably why it looks more believably real to you.The Star Destroyer model in the original Star Wars was actually pretty small (EDIT: very very small, only 3 feet) for a shot that close and they were worried it wouldn't look good enough. They built a larger one (8.5 ft) for Empire and used it in an IMAX remake of the opening shot of Star Wars. (The IMAX footage was only a demo and is not used in any version of A New Hope.)"
"bad copy of IMAX version: http://youtu.be/I733E_EtD2MDidn't LOTR use similar models; very detailed and very big (for models)."
"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYUY3i9TamY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYUY3i9TamY)Also multiple versions of pretty much all of them.This makes me want to watch the movies again...it also makes me frustrated with the Hobbit.I think the biggest problem is the Hobbit's hyper use of colour grading. Sometimes I feel like the CG itself used in place of models would've looked fine, if it didn't always have a magic hour insane sunset blasting over it. Yeah wtf happened....I would have never had known so much thought went into those two giant sculptures on the riverwow that was amazingMy favorite Star Wars model detail will always be the hidden Playboy poster on the cockpit wall of the Tantive IV.Because I'd never heard of this, [I did the leg work for everyone.](http://www.therpf.com/attachments/f10/studio-scale-tantive-iv-swrunner-jpg-27077d1276046937)"
"Obviously NSFW I guessThe Playboy poster is cool, but holy shit a poster from the movie that the freaking space ship is in is fantastic. When does this happen in the movie?!"
"http://i.imgur.com/QYyF1ME.jpgIf your boss spot that, he knew it was there.Screw the kittens, this is the best album I have ever seen on the entire interwebs!Precision of language, please.> Screw the kittens"
"Lana, *PHRASING*.I just want to *play* with them all. I'm 39 years old, but I really wanna play with some freaking Star Wars toys right now.Fun fact: The images of the Death Star from Return of the Jedi were reversed on screen because George Lucas thought it looked better that way. If you[ look closely](http://i.imgur.com/s4zVh3e.jpg) you will notice the model is backwards from every shot in the film. i.e. the half finished part is on the left instead of the right.Do you have any idea what all those-ladder/hand rail looking pieces are that make up the unfinished part? They look like they could be part of some sort of model kit, but I have clue what...No idea but they could be anything and not from a model kit. Something tells me those [ladder pieces](http://i.imgur.com/WvvSnDZ.jpg) are actually a really delicate thin metal.I think it's amazing that they even bothered making a model for the second Death Star, considering how it was basically nothing more than a backdrop. They could have just made a matte painting, but no, they went the extra mile and made the model to make sure all the little details really come out.They probably originally intended to use it much more heavily than what made the final cut.Could you imagine fight scenes and all out battles competing for the various entry ways through the exposed tunnels and hallways?I never noticed before, but if you were sitting in the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon the view to the left would be obscured by the ship."
"Also, how did they get the detail on the outer skin of the ships? Not as bad as all the TIE fighter pilots, who have their views obscured by two wings and a very small cockpit window.Not really... if you look at it, the cockpit sits slightly above the plane of the ship. Sure, the lower left hand side of the ship obstructs some of your view... but it's not that bad when you think about driving your car. You sit in the mid-upper left hand side (right if you're European) and a good portion of the road and your surroundings are blocked from view to your right... but you are rarely ever paying attention to that area... unless you're parking or making an oddly close turn.Much of it comes from other models, things like battle ships, and airplane model kits.> how did they get the detail on the outer skin of the ships"
"A few things"
"Scribers, and sharp things and a flexible straight edge: Just make intentional looking marks for panel lines then..."
"A bottle of glue:... Well gallon sized bottles of glue"
"A huge parts bin: All the extra crap that they had from the other model kits they were tearing parts out of. A good example is the under side rear on the Aluminum Falcons skin which is made of numerous tank accessories like armor plates, skirts, and hatches."
"Top tier scenery painters. You can cover up an amazing array of globby hack ass shit stuck on something with a bad ass paint job."
"One of the major secrets to scratch building and kit bashing for fantasy is that you can get away with a ton of stuff simply because no one really knows what its supposed to be or really look like so it all fits and a huge dose of Well because I told you it looks like that, that's why. goes a long way[What the hell's an Aluminum Falcon?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F1d3QWsyk0)That's just...awesome.  I always assumed there was just this ridiculous amount of detailed clay modelling that would then get turned into plastic molds.  This makes me want to build my own stuff with my kid.Come visit the folks over at /r/minipainting, /r/modelmakers, /r/terrainbuilding, and any of the various tabletop game subs! (/r/warmachine, /r/warhammer as some examples, and there are tons more!)I believe the cockpit on the Falcon is raised up a bit so you should be able to see over the front of the ship. But think of a basic Tie Fighter! Completely obscured vision on the left and right. Not a great design. You are correct, the cockpit is higher than the nose of the ship."
"Source: I looked to my right, where my lego version of the Falcon is standing on the coffee table.You don't need to see all you need is [this!] (http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130311051338/starwars/images/b/bc/TIE_target_FF7.png)Well that's what targeting computers are for.  Presumably those TIE-fighter pilot helmets would have HUDs projected onto the inside of those insectoid lenses which let them have a full view of everything around them.Haha that's why they crash so much! All they see is straight!But they have that sweet vector-graphics targeting system!I feel like there's social commentary to be found in there.When will our politicians quit playing partisan games and step out of their tie fighters?Yah, like blinders on a race horse or something to that effect.CGI is wonderful and all, but man I'd love to see models make a comeback mixed in. CGI will never be as good as real models.  For some reason, suspension of disbelief is easier for me with shitty models than with fair CGI.  How about all the times you didn't relalize there were any CGI?Hasn't happened.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sZS8OVyVr4"
"yeah, you totally noticed all those if you watched the filmThis guyCgi can often be extremely subtle and change very tiny things. I guarantee there's been CGI you haven't noticed. For the new Star Wars movie they are building models. Just... 1:1 scale models.I think those are called sets :-PHoly shit. Those episode 7 models are epic.God bless 1987's Robocop. They just don't make films like that anymore. Such a shame.VFX producer here. Models are still used pretty frequently. We encourage directors to use models when they can because you see what you're getting right away, and it's already integrated. Most CG assets are created as a physical model first during the concept phase, because it's easier for a director to see a physical model before him and approve it, than it his for him to see a 2d concept or CG turntable. From there we use that model as a reference for the CG model. We can cyberscan it, cutting down on tons of CG modeling hours."
"When I started in VFX back at Digital Domain, they had their own model shop.Have you seen these?"
"[Episode 7 Millennium Falcon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWVdbOeNSsY)"
"[Episode 7 New X-Wing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWBGrkc360M)i kind of wodner if in reality, if we ever achieve space travel, that such ships will be incredibly simple."
"Seems like there are so many things that can go wrong with these desgins.Wait. Was that the Tumbler from Batman at the end?yeah, it was made as affectionate ribbing from JJ Abrams to Zack SnyderThe music also became 'The Dark Knight'-ishNot just Dark Knight-ish That's Hans Zimmer's score. Yeah, it was part of an ongoing social media joke between JJ Abrams and Zack Snyder, where they mashed up Batman and Star Wars. Yes. An Easter Egg.The thing I could never figure out about the Millennium Falcon is that the YT-1300 class ship is supposed to be a cargo ship. Yet it has very little space for cargo. [As a matter of fact, it has very little space for anything](http://i.imgur.com/K9qVdNz.jpg). Sure, you supposedly can reconfigure it somewhat and they have some models that were supposed to have bigger cargo bays... but even then, the entrances and airlocks are so small, you could barely fit any decent conventional cargo in those things."
"It'd be like starting up a moving company, but instead of buying a Semi-tractor trailer or a big box-truck, you buy a Ford Explorer and argue that the back seats fold down.[deleted]So, then, they would PUSH a giant container of some sort? Yeah, that would be easy.I think most of the circular area has cargo space, the cutaway is just showing you what's on top of the ceiling.Even if 70% of this ship were cargo area, its small cramped weird angled cargo area that's almost impossible to get to through the airlocks or that tiny little walk way. You can't even fit two guys side by side on the on ramp."
"Yet they send two Jedi in a ship that's the size of an ocean liner in episode 1.Han was a ricer. If you want to haul inexpensive freight then, yeah, you'd need huge capacity in order to make it worth your while but take a look at a [list of the most valuable substances on earth](http://www.businessinsider.com/most-valuable-substances-by-weight-2014-9?op=1). They are all very expensive but also very small/light. It wouldn't be a reach to assume that a smuggler would be hauling similar materials which wouldn't need much room yet be worth a great deal. One time I went to the sketchy part of town and found some guy with a Ford Explorer to find me safe passage to some chick's hometown that I'd never been to (I didn't know her but, like, I'd seen pictures and she was pretty smokin' hot.  Also later found out she was related, so kind of a boner-killer.)"
"His truck was a piece of junk (told him this to his face) and his dog called shotgun every time.  When he introduced himself as captain I should have known he was overselling it.If I understand correctly the ship was heavily modified over the years with a lot of added equipment. See this for some light reading:"
"http://www.galactic-voyage.com/Light%20Side-Transports-YT-1300%20Transport%20Millennium%20Falcon.htm"
"I'm guessing the added equipment took up a lot of what would have been cargo space when it was new.I've always wanted to see someone do a what if design representing what a factory fresh YT-1300 looks like.  I imagine that we are looking at a sort of Mad Max in space stripped down ship-- most of it's paneling removed, lost, or replaced, various bits jutting out of the surface planes like aftermarket manifolds and exhaust or removed hoods on cars."
"Similar to how the Y-Wings were given a cowl and the mythos describes the original trilogy ships to be de-armored for the sake of rapid maintenance and deployment."
"http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090310063841/starwars/images/d/d4/BTL-B_Y-wing_fighter.jpg"
"Two possibilities here:  (1) Either Han modified it so much and filled up all its cargo space with hardware that it no longer had room to haul anything big; or (2) it was intended as a cargo *escort* or *tow*, and would either provide defense for cargo fleets or had the ability to attach some sort of trailer containers for the actual cargo.  That would make the Falcon itself more like the cab of a tractor trailer than a container ship."
"In fact, looking at the [Wookieepedia entry for the YT-1300](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/YT-1300_light_freighter) confirms my suspicions.  Seems there was a lot of opportunity for customization and Han (as well as Lando, probably) made the most of that, sacrificing much of his cargo space for machinery that let him escape raids and make quick runs.  [There's even an illustration of one of them outfitted with extra cargo pods on the dorsal side](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130903003137/starwars/images/3/35/Yt1300_cargo_pods.png).So the forks on the front of the Millennium Falcon have tractor beams, the idea being they act like a trailer hitch to grab cargo containers in space and push them. So the Falcon is kinda like a tractor trailer, but we never see the trailer part.  Han Solo was a smuggler and you probably don't need a whole lot of room to store space coke.Yeah but the ship probably wasn't built custom just for him. OP claims that it was originally made as a legitimate cargo ship, which you'd think would require more space for cargo.Yeah I was always under the impression that he was never supposed to look like an actual cargo ship. Flying casual and all you wouldn't want to always have to pull over to the space weigh stations...  You mean spice.It didn't even feel like I just looked at a 140 photos.*What the hell is an Aluminium Falcon?*So I threw the Senate at him - *the whole senate!!**Now get your 7'2 asthmatic ass back here, or I'm going to tell everyone what a whiny bitch you were about Padamamay or Panda Bear or whatever the hell her name is!!!*"
"Bookmarked to check out the detail later. Thanks very much!Does anybody know how they went about with ship greeble? Was it custom made with a vacuum former or something or was it just randomized bits and boxes being generated onto plastic. I'd love to know where these are now.  It would a shame if they all got trashed..I was hoping to find the answer to this in these comments. Anyone know where all these models ended up?[Many of them](http://www.originalprop.com/blog/2014/01/30/exclusive-237-lostunpublished-historic-star-wars-and-indiana-jones-movie-prop-photos-from-the-lucasfim-archives-from-19961997/) are preserved at the [Lucasfilm Archives at Skywalker Ranch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ulc5nENgY), but I'm betting most of the larger ones were dismantled due to storage constraints.  It's possible they're still sitting in [crates](http://i.imgur.com/ILR6Rou.jpg) somewhere.Lucas digitally archived it.It just occured to me that all the toy models we had as kids, while dreaming of flying in *real* space ships, were as real as it only could get. Basically the whole original trilogy has been filmed with models like these.I love how raw the ships look. Pipes sticking out, plating overlapping, vents for stuff. They look like real machines. The teardrop sleek ships in the prequels were terribly designed as far as consistency goes. The woman in the picture next to the death star is currently one of our teachers at my school. Most of our class time with her involved us just asking her to tell stories about working on Star Wars and other projects. I was grateful we had that opportunity to learn from her :)To own one of these would be simply amazing... that said they really should be in a star wars exhibit.I saw some of these in person at the Air and Space museum in DC when they did their big Star Wars exibit in the 90s and again at the Ben Franklin Museum in Philly about four or five years ago when they did theirs. They are very neat to look at up close. The level of detail is crazy.If I had a 3d printer...Haha, my first thought was that too. I bet these guys wouldn't be impressed since their work is a lot more difficult. This is why models trump CGI for realism. Because they're REAL.It's difficult to walk with this throbbing erection"
"edit: *the greebling...huuuuunngnghgh*Right now, a team of people are working to make a full sized replica of this."
"Somebody is taking a tiny prop and a few sets and turning it into a full sized ship. That's awesome.Seriously, it looks like there's a Star Wars post making to the frontpage every single day. Are they preparing marketing for something coming up?I guess this isn't a revelation to anyone who builds models, but I find it amazing how crucial the chipped paint and burn marks and weathering are. They absolutely take these models from fake to real./r/practicaleffectsmasterraceTie Interceptors are the coolest looking ones.The model of Enterprise-D went for $576k at an auction. Just imagine how much the model of the Death Star, or the Executor, or the MF, Luke's X-wing or the original ISD that chased Leia's Corellian Corvette will be.Honestly this seals it for me that Star Wars isn't real. Damning evidence.I'm usually not someone to get all jazzed about details on models....but....DAYAM! FapFapFapFapFapFapFapit's crazy how much skinnier nerds were in the 70's? actual physical activity can do that.I have ALWAYS wondered what the unfinished floors of the new Death Star looked like close up. Thanks for taking the time to post all these nits is amazing how talented the people who work for ILM are at detailThanks a lot for sharing, do you have photos that are larger that you could share? I'm very interested in seeing more. I don't have any larger photos unfortunately. This collection is just 940x535, but hopefully the close-up shots will make up for that. no calamari cruisers then. poop.And then part of me is saying This shit would take forever to make, just build the real thing.I know the clear difference between wants and needs, and I NEED one of these. Someone should summon Skydart and see if her dad would do a little ama about these.I chatted with her about him doing one a few days ago, and then I heard a rumor from someone else that he's doing it today at 1pm. Looking for confirmation before I post about it though.Oh that's awesome , I had no idea. Thanks for the heads up!/r/starshipporn Just came.[Especially when all the big robot walking things in Hoth were done frame by frame by moving the legs a bit at a time](http://www.scifinow.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tippet-animates-at-at-1024x681.jpg)This is wonderful. I had seen brief glimpses of some of  these in a documentary, but that was even before dvr. The detail on these is enough for any modeling enthusiast to obsess over for weeks. Thank you, OP!Amazing stuff, I hope someday these are imported into a virtual environment so we can check them out with our Oculus Rifts. Maybe even with modeled interiors so we can shrink down and explore the insides too.  [I mean, I guess those are kinda impressive but..](http://i.imgur.com/GhFBRxh.gif)I just came.... here to say youve made my dayThe foot of the AT-ST really blew me way.I feel like the models were superior to CGI in some ways. The CGI always looks to perfect and clean. It's got this pristine presentation that just makes it look fake.Well, I won't be able to sleep anymore, why is the god damn B-WING side way with B-foils open, god damn it!horrible photos. bad composition. the guy didnt even use the rule of thirds.As someone who makes miniatures for a living, this made me tingly inside. Absolutely  beautiful detail, makes me jealous. I'd love to do this for free!As much as I appreciate the detail that goes into modern CGI, there is always a soft spot in my heart for those that create physical models.What's with the Hebrew letters on the speeder in image 105?Thanks OP, this is a truly amazing documentation! CGI has its advantages, but seeing these models (just like the amazing city set from Blade Runner) I can only hope for a revival of this craft. was ILM sold to Disney as well? Disney bought Lucasfilm Limited, which owns ILM outright. So in an indirect way, yes.Had no idea the speeder bike has reverse gear!The star destroyer dome spikes look like pieces from the game Battleship.  I'd buy that Nebulon-B if I couldWow the detail is incredible. I can't imagine putting something like these together.I think making these would be my dream job. Dat deathstar! These make me miss Star Wars so muchShould we expect anything like this in the new film? I know they're building big models but I haven't heard anything about small-model ultra-detail work like this.I wonder how much these would sell for. These are incredible... Even if you don't like the movies, one can't help to appreciate the art and talent that went into these... amazing... Thanks for sharing with us!**Number 11** - so easy, even a *caveman* can do itDrybrushing.  Drybrushing everywhere.dat greeble That was awesome! its amazing how detailed every piece is It's goddamn amazing. That Nebulon B and Super Star Destroyer god damn*drools*Who has all these models now?Why do I have an erection right now?Ah, the classic days of movie modeling building, when they used pieces of airplane and battleship kits to construct the sides of the star destroyer.I was always a fan as a kid.  And in 6th grade I had the chance to see a bunch of the props close up in person.  It amazed me how small everything really was.  Only because I didn't know any better. But I remember I only wanted to see the millennium falcon when I was there, and there in a big Glass case in the middle, there it was.  It fascinated Me, the amount of detail they put into it. Props to the people who made all of these.The Y-wing is my favorite starfighter.I'd like to see a photo series of where are they now. I can't imagine what these would go for in an auction. That thing is operational!You made my inner-geek cry with happiness. This is my fetish.The dude in 39 has to be a serial killer!It's funny how every time I see a picture of Lucas I get a feeling of seething disgust, followed by a reluctant infinite gratefulness.so how were these used in the film making process? Were all the exterior shots of these vehicles all models & the interior were sets/people? Where are these models now? Imagine their collector valueDo these things ever go up for sale? i wonder how much they are worth...Those little X-wing fighters makes me wonder why Luke couldn't lift one out of the swamp.http://i.imgur.com/TkmPXGl.jpg this one looks like an USB port.Man, this is such an amazing reference for modelling practice.I would give my firstborn up for that Millennium Falcon.I love the halogen bulb in the Super Star destroyerYears ago there was a traveling museum exhibition The Art of Star Wars.  Amazing to see the models upclose.  Oh, and there's a movie poster and mini-playboy centerfold in the Rebel Blockage Runner [cockpit1](http://www.hooverae.com/upload/files/290408/6670666.jpeg) [cockpit2](http://img300.imageshack.us/img300/4583/brposter1qw5.jpg) (mini-NSFW-ish)These are incredible!Those guys are really good at that.That's hotTIL Paul Mitchell worked at ILMI always wondered how Han was so good flying the Falcon through such tight spaces when the cockpit is offset like that.Felt overwhelmed by these.Fun Fact: all the random surface details that was so popular in 70's - early 80's syfi is called Greebleing or Greebles."
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GreebleOut of all the sci-fi flicks over the years, I feel like Star Wars still has the coolest ship design."
"If only they had 3D printing like we have todayMy dad worked at ILM for a short time during Empire Strikes Back, contracted to work on their phones via Mitel."
"Apparently the Executor was about 8 or 9 feet long and all the Star Destroyers had flashlights for their engines. The flashlights were turned on for filming and then painted over with the characteristic blue glow. He said the detail on it was absurd.I would like one those ships as an external hard drive.Anyone know if there is a book of Star Wars models? That makes me want to go out and get a plastic kit to put together... almost.also the [blade runner](http://www.geek.com/geek-cetera/how-the-blade-runner-opening-sequence-was-created-1284218/) models. it's hard to believe that grandiose opening scene is basically just some LEDs in models :)I do love the look of Y-Wings, they just look purely utilitarian.[No banana's!?](http://i.imgur.com/GXFTywu.jpg)"
"2/10."
"^^^but ^^^not ^^^really, ^^^this ^^^shit ^^^is ^^^amazingMan, this is just one of those art forms that kids today can't fully appreciate. I can't imagine the thousands of hours that went into creating these miniatures. And the detail! 30+ years later and I still get excited seeing these. Thanks for sharing OP!With the detail they put in those, you'd expect that they could actually fly.Death Star II looks incredible, my jaw dropped when I saw the close-up scaffolding.  You can tell they thought in detail about how a space station that size and shape would actually be built and constructed.I can't even imagine how much someone would pay for that Death Star. xDIt makes you realize that, these movie are as big as they are for a reason. They're damn well done movies!so this is what we are doing todayThese photos make the models look *even better* than they do in the movies. Awesome.Never realised how much General Grievous' ship looks like the Rebel cruisers (or larger ships, not sure of the correct term). Ah, the Millenium Falcon. Still as sexy as the first time I saw him.man, I would love that job. :)Where exactly did these photographs come from? Very interesting"
"You should post this @ r/SciFiModels They'd love it over there. Thanks for sharingDamn there's eagle parts everywhere :PGoddamn, X-Wings will never not be cool. Imagine having a job to build this sort of stuff. How lucky!!What, no A-Wings?Not including the full size mock-up does anyone know how big was the largest model of the Millennium Falcon?  For reference, the thing in the centre of the X-Wing on the 35th image, are the controls from the boiler of a model steam locomotive :DIt's an older model, sir, but it checks out.Never noticed before that Y-Wings have a gun mounted over the cockpit.what the hell is an 'aluminum falcon'?'The Death Star shots actually took my breath away.I think the success of star wars has to do with how awesome the art direction is.  The imperial space craft especially look badass. In most movies I hate the art direction and i can't enjoy it as muchGimme Would pay serious money for falcon or xwing!!Too bad they had to cut most of the B-Wing scenes. Was the raw footage of these scenes ever releases, so we could see what sweet B-Wing action we missed out on?I have a gallery of Star Wars models and props on my FB photography page from the Orlando Science Center. Check it out! https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.250262775161429.1073741831.171593799694994&type=1I'm 21 and didn't see any of the original trilogy until the last year or two. To be honest, I didn't like them that much, and I was never quite able to understand what made them so cool to so many people."
"When I see stuff like this, I realize why people like them so much. When this movie came out, there was probably nothing like it at all. It was brand new, and certain parts of it were extremely well done, like these ship designs for instance, and the score. This novelty and ingenuity made the movie an instant classic when it came out, understandably."
"I took all of this for granted. I'd had 20 years worth of modern space movies and excellent graphics, so when I finally got around to watching Star Wars, I was generally unimpressed. Most people my age who grew up with Star Wars didn't have that experience because it was all new to them, just like it was to people when it first came out."
"But even I have to say these models are pretty fucking awesome. I found a mistake..."
"In the second picture that shows the X and Y-wings, there are two Red Leader X-wings.All those hours of work. Only to be replaced with CGI in the rereleases.Thank you for sharing."
"Personally I always like these models over CGI, after a couple years CGI movies can look out date but physical models for some reason just hold up. I think this is just me.  I wonder what they did with them after filming, I wonder how much one would cost to buy these daysThis is why the Original Trilogy is important to have in it's Theatrical version. So much of this work is covered up with CGI in the special editions. These people's work deserves to be seen. Thanks for sharingSimply amazing.  So much detail, the Death Star 2 and Executor Star Destroyer must have taken a LONG time to finish.  All those intricate panels and markings.  Makes it truly look like it is a functional space ship/station.Seeing all those photos makes me wanna watch the OT right now!The pictures are cool and all, but seeing them in person was super awesome (STAR WARS: Where Science Meets Imagination exhibit).I recently read in one of the The Art of Star Wars books that Vader's star destroyer was wired with 250,000 individual lights. 250,000. A quarter of a million lights. So cool. These are amazing. Thanks for sharing. http://www.blogolect.comScale model porn straight up. I got really sad when I got towards the bottom and didn't see a Tie Interceptor and B-wing, then boom. Save the best for last.So many greebles, far too many for a mortal or group of mortals to have constructed.26 yr old me wants to go play with those in the backyardMaking the laser beam sounds right now....pew pew!Twin Ion Engine Fighters (TIE Fighters)"
"Do you think the name came first or the vehicle's bow tie shaped design."
"These models have exquisite detail and show incredible continuity as a whole in the Star Wars cannon.  None of these movies would be nearly as convincing and entertaining if it weren't for this craftsmanship. Saw star wars in the title and instant upvoted I can't believe this used to be a real job. I'm so jealous.It was half way through the set before I realized that I was hearing the imperial march theme in my head.As someone who builds scale models what impressed me the most was the weathering effects. You can tell which ships belong to the rebels vs the empire simply based on how grungy they look."
"Even a simple picture like this shows how much attention was put in to these scale models. Just look at the realistic texture and chipping"
"http://i.imgur.com/5F5XZMZ.jpg"
"a)texture was added for a metalic the details are ridiculously insaneAmazing.  Where are these models kept/displayed now?  They are priceless.Hopefully there won't be any hate or emotion in the models as the Marxist overlords would put the models in the Gulag http://igg.me/at/gulagbarashevo1983 -- We'll be done with this Super Star Destroyer in ... yeah, three months."
"2014 -- Ah shit, we need to move this engine. I'm going to print another copy. I'll be back after lunch.wounder how much these are worth now a daysSomehow, seeing the Millenium Falcon as a balsa wood frame makes me sad.  Like seeing a shot of Christopher Reeve in underpants wearing wires.To anyone wondering what those little bumps on sci-fi ships are called: they're referred to as [Greebles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeble)This is what I want to do with my life. Building models like these would be my dream job.So if I wanted to buy one of these, how impossible would that be?Thought I'd just look at a few. 140 photos later...http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GreebleNow we *finally* know what the other side of the Death Star II looks like.You guys probably won't believe this, but my uncles friends dad worked on these. When the movie was done the dad gave these to his son to play with when he was a kid. He beat them up and played with them pretty rough as he described to me. Later on when he grew up, he threw them away. He regrets it majorly. He grew up to create the game Gears of War, so I guess he didn't lose out that much.This is why 4, 5, and 6 are far better than 1, 2, and 3.   If you take that much time on the models and special effects, you're going to put as much effort into the story and charters.  1, 2, and 3 were beautiful c.g.i. effects, but had no depth beyond that. Wow! That's amazing!I'm not sure if anyone else has brought this up, but even without a reference I can generally tell when something is small and the camera is really close vs. something that's just really big.  It's very obvious with anything with water (the waves move wrong), but even still models just look small."
"I don't know what I'm seeing that clues me in and was wondering if anyone knows what it could be?  My first thought is that maybe it has to do with the depth of shadows.  The contrast between light and dark doesn't get as pronounced on something small as it would on something huge.  That's just a guess though.Could this level of detail be matched by 3D printers?My brain can't even handle what all these would be worth to a collector today."
"(And no, I'm not talking about Rick's offers down at his pawn shop.)I'd always sat there in awe whenever the Super Star Destroyer would come on screen, it's breathtaking. By far my favorite space ship in sc-fi.I've always like the Y-Wing. It's the A-10 of space; a tough, hard charging flying tank.I greatly wish that I could own these, and a nice house (or cave [or basement]) to display them inAmazing details thanks for posting. Surprised not to see any ATAT's thoughimperial walker?http://i.imgur.com/ma0lvMP.jpg"
"That looks like a T-34/85 model kit turret! So cool!FAPFAPFAPFAPIs that a modern tank turret (with the barrel modified) on top of the frigate?  Quick jam their comms, centre switch.  Which bloody centre switch?! Didn't realise the speeder bikes were so detailed.  Thanks for sharing, these are great pictures. Back when all models were grey and razors were needed for EVERY SINGLE PART.Yeah.  Beautiful.This is beautiful."
"Thank you."
"Edit: Picture 85 and 86 are simply fantastic. Like, I want them framed or have it in my wallet and just look at it from time to time when I feel depressed.Someone Help Please:"
"I learned a term many years ago to describe the type inordinate detail added to items like these to make them look more sci-fi."
"Stars Wars is one of the common areas of use for this word. Example is the amount of intricate detail on the battleships, often in reality what is shown would have no use in real life, but by adding this crazy amount of little details makes it look larger and more sci-fi."
"All I can remember was something like Gremmeling Grammaling  or something in that vein. Please, I have been trying to remember this term for years. It is an itch I must scratch!I think the word you're looking for is [Greeble](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeble)I love it, I love it, I love you!"
"I guess I should have read ALL of the posts as I see some others reference this term."
"But seriously I can't thank you enough. At least once a year, sometimes 2-4, I would think of this term and hate myself for not being able to remember what the word was. That tip of your tongue / brain itch was killing me!"
"Thank you for spending the time to respond. It is really appreciated.Hah i did it the hard way.. With legos..I used to feel accomplished when I glued together a Phantom (F4) model... jeez...These are fucking *great.*  I was always taken by the extremely intricate details of the models in the original trilogy.  Thanks for posting these.I can build those too... Out of LegosThe Executor... I could stare at that thing all day.I like the shots where the designers are holding the ships, I imagine them making sounds like pssssshyuuuuuuu  whoooooooshshhhhhshhshhIt's a crime there's not a single Slave 1 picture here :( Always was my favorite ship. Wonderful collection. Wish there was more A-Wing.I really enjoy making models so this was very interesting, thanks! MMmm, dem greebles. Amazing!! Hey theres a name for the repeating machinery patterns on ships, does anyone know the word I'm looking for? Its used to describe random patterns of pipes/engines/turrets/innards like the [sids of the imperial battlecruiser](http://i.imgur.com/8WKoyrl.jpg) and the [trench of the deathstar](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130117161338/starwars/images/b/bf/Meridian_trzench-ANH.png).Greebling.Wow!  Seeing these makes me feel like a little kid again.Now I want to be an epically bearded model builder from the seventies. Ever since i was little I always thought all those details showed very little engineering intelligence. So many large scale systems are housed external to the pressure vessel that you wouldn't be able to access half of the ship. and why bother even installing external panels if youre just going to weaken them with hundreds of pass-throughs and bulkhead fittings? On the stern of the cruiser there is turbomachinery embedded half in and half out of the bulkhead, including inlets that are half open to space. Do they think we're stupid?Impressive. Most ImpressiveMan, I wonder how much you'd get for that Millennium Falcon on ebay... Has any of the ship models ever been sold?I would pay the entire GDP of a small country for that Second Death Star.One question I had in the back of my mind for a while and never bothered to research: why do science fiction spacecraft have a staggered look? Like bits and bobs sticking out, especially for large spacecraft.i've always liked model building. my only problem is what to do when it's done? I don't really *care* for the final product. Don't really care that much to sit it on a shelf or show it off- i simply enjoy the process of building it. It becomes a considerably expensive piece of plastic junk by the end. I've never been able to work that out in my brain so i haven't touch any kits in years. I wish i could just *build* models and not feel guilty for having this expensive hunk of junk at the end."
"I've thought about doing some kit bashing and just making a massive starship or something where the build process never really ends. Just keep adding bits and parts and things to it. Sorta looks like Ray Charles hijacked the Falcon there..Did anyone else click on the 50th picture to get a close up and notice the dog face toward the bottom left? Or the darker colored image of a hungry dragon blowing fire to the upper right of what the cannon is built into?Link to image [#50](http://i.imgur.com/nffIBom.jpg)."

Pretty cool stuff.  I couldn't decide which one I wanted more, the Imp Star Destroyer, or the Millennium Falcon.  Both were so damned cool.Seeing the Millennium Falcon without all the detail work made me think What the hell's an aluminum falcon anyway?So much better than lame CG.Genius. All I can say is ... GeniusI remember seeing a movie about these models and the making of a lot of the original effects. Anyone here know which documentary it was?Take that shitty cgi of today. I wish models were more common these days.basically big boys' airfix - would have loved to do that.In the movie they could have done more justice to the Super Star Destroyer it looks more massive as a model than it did in the movie.Quick, jam their comlinks, center switch"
"Not at all obvious wtf the center switch is! Leia would be like all uhhhh, what? Which one? then crash into a tree while staring at the panel.Plot twist- Hannibal Lecter was the owner of the Falcon before Lando, who lost it to Han:"
"http://i.imgur.com/m7FJ3pV.jpgThis makes me miss the tie defender and old x-wing PC games of the 90's. They need to bring back the best space flight sim games ever made. [wat](http://imgur.com/Dzxhkqz)Its crazy when there is more detail in these models than some objects in CGI. Where's the batmobile easter eggThis is gold! Wonder how long it took them to do it back then compared to how long it would take now with 3d printers  Can someone explain the large, open area in the middle of the Falcon?  Wondered that since I was littleThis is why watching models over CG will always be more interesting. Even in older films, you can at least appreciate the effort that went in to the construction no matter how fake it looks. The same cannot be said for most CGI. And definitely not for most of the CG in the new prequels. Anyone have any close-ups of the TIE Fighter?I couldn't even look at these without going pew pew! VVVVRRRRRRNNN! in my head.Models look so much better than CGI. The movies that used models generally still look great. Compare that to Early CGI like episode 1. Who knew keeping it real would hold up better over time. Surprisingly enough, Episode 1 used a ton of models...even more than the original films, if I believe. It wasn't until AOTC that the CGI really took over.So awesome visually, but so many pipes, and gadgets and important looking stuff with no protective plate shielding over it.I wish it was still done this way.Ever notice how sci-fi done with practical effects holds up over time? Prequel Yoda is a joke.How much would these be worth?It's amazing to think that 3d printing can replace all the 1000s of man hours put into these models I wonder how much one of these prop costs.Back in the 90s' my Grandmother took me to the Moscone Center in SF. They had a HUGE exhibit of some of these models and tons of mannequins in actual costumes. My favorite things were Han Solo in carbonite and the Yoda puppet. RIP Grandma thanks for taking me tons of cool places. Looking at these brings me an incredible amount of joy. I am now inspired to hunt for more. Do you recommend any books that offer similar images? Thanks for posting.Looking at these, I can't help but think someone said at some point don't worry about aerodynamics in space. Also, forget about symmetry.This should go over to /r/StarshipPorn Simply amazing. One of the most interesting things, IMO, is the balance between detail and the illusion of detail. One of the things you can see is that they've added [greebles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeble) to the models. Greebles are also commonly used in CGI. Somewhat related to this is also [dithering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither).Cool, but why?You just gave all of /r/minecraft a creative boner.WHAT IS THIS? A STAR DESTROYER FOR ANTS???This is an amazing collection!  Thanks OP!  The care and detail blows my mind!Red leader standing by. Red 3 standing by.Great collection! Quite a few I have never seen before. I found the Blue leader paint job interesting as well as the wider fuselage on the (prototye ?) X-Wing."
"It's amazing how they turned tank, car, truck etc model kits and turned them into those incredible props."
"Thanks for sharing! Didn't think I would actually look at all 140 pictures. O.K. Maybe a stupid question but the two balls on top of the Empire Star Destroyers are radar installations or are they water towers not unlike the ones that dot any country landscape?These are astounding That is a lost art and it's a damned shame.Does anyone know if these models still exist?  And will they be in the Chicago museum once it opens?What was that a shot of between the speeder bike and the AT-ST? Does anyone know?this kid I went to school with, his dad was one of the special effects guys for these films occassionally I see his face in these photos and or in the credits of other films.what does it say in the yellow box on the side of the B-Wing (2nd to last photo)?B wing and the A wing my favoritesWhy cant they do this for the new movies.it would take me at least a year to build just one of those models.It's like looking at the world's coolest toy collection.This is a lost art....And what would one of these little gems cost?They get paid to more or less play with legos. I'm seriously jealous.epic. insaine detail. love itGuy in pic 11 is definitely making spaceship sounds. I've never understood the reasoning as to why a ship of the *Executor*'s size has such a small bridge. In comparison to the regular Star Destroyers, it's absolutely tiny.Am I the only one has the star wars them song playing in their head as they scroll yhrought theses pictures?Wow this is incredible!!all those little wires...Made my dad take me to the museum of science and industry when they had the special effects exhibit back in the day. I got to see some of these up close! They had the winnebago from space balls too.3d printing would have been amazingThe attention to detail exemplifies why I love Star Wars so much. They really believed in what they were doing. 140 images of why Star Wars is a lie.I was really hoping that the pictures would be of better quality.What is this? A DeathStar for ants?I absolutely would have loved blowing those up as a childCGI changed so much in the movie industry. How many model builders made the transition to computer modeling compared to the number that just left the industry I wonder. This is so remarkable to me. I think that the absurd level detailing on the technology for the original trilogy really sold it. I remember being in awe of the circuitry and compartments on the Star Destroyer on the opening shot of Star Wars, it really gave a sense of scale and made it believable that there are 10,000 people aboard this 3-foot long model. And this was when every individual component had to modeled by hand and couldn't be procedurally generated in 3D software. So cool.I swear every second day something Star Wars related is posted on this sub.Just goes to show the wealth of practical effort that went into the OT. Is this a complaint?  The modern film industry arguably owes more to Star Wars than any other major film.I feel like the actual building of physical models can generate those happy accidents people talk about in movies. Something falls into the right place, or something gets stuck to something else... it ends up creating a whole new, even more interesting thing."
"Does CGI even have these kinds of accidents? Can things be discovered in the rendering the same way they can with real world models?What star ship is that in pictures 65 - 69 (I think) the Twin red ball shaped ones? I can't recognise itI think it was from the cloud city.  Yep.  They were the ones shooting at / arguing with Han when he first tried to land at Cloud City in ESB.Even though I do 3D art I still love practical effects and think they look oodles better than CGI. Dewwwd.  Fuck CGI, moviemakers need to return to this lost art of superdetailed physical models.   The craftsmanship here is killer.  Even today, these old images still look so much more real to me and capture my imagination more than anything I've ever seen rendered from a computer. Wouldn't it be more reasonable just to ask for better movies, instead of blaming it on the way that they're made?So much better than CGI.I love the kit bashed models.  CGI just can't invoke the same feel as the physical models.These models are so beautiful....in so many ways that CGI can't....My only thought was: Looks better than CGI. How so? Good CGI lets the artists put much more detail in, and produce renderings at the proper scale.I hope those dudes learned how to use a computerThe Falcon engine array has turkey feathers! (seen on F-15 etc. engines) WowAnd that's why the old movies are better. The amount of work, detail and caring ...not just CGI like today. Don't get me wrong CGI has a place but used in combination..wow. Come on JJ Abrams do it right.I think it would be cool to 3d print badass future-craft for sci-fi films these days.   In a way, it's still computer assisted special effects, just not CGI.That has to be weird to be working on a model that size and then see it on the big screen as if it were the titanic. The attention to detail is astounding and the feeling of authenticity will never be captured imo with CGI. Have you seen Gravity? It's not on the same scale, but I think it would beg to differ.I wish special effects were still done this way.Such a lost art. Also shows me just how damned accurate toys are.I wouldn't say that it's a totally lost art. It's mostly digital now, but you would be surprised by the similarities in techniques.People obsess about the details of props of Star Wars because they can't deal with the complex story elements of a better property like Star Trek.Why do stories need to be complex?Sadly you probably couldn't even make one of these for the prequels because it's probably all CGI.[You sure about that?](http://boards.theforce.net/threads/practical-effects-in-the-prequels-sets-pictures-models-etc.50017310/)Shit those were the glory days for movies when shit was real in movies instead of ALL CG that shit gets aggravating after a while lol.Even though there are still plenty of practical effects?Thank god for 3D printersI pushed these to our networked display system at the front desk. Not because it's relevant to my job, but because it is freaking awesome.Much cooler than CGI.Sorry, CGI fans: There is NO substitute for creating tangible objects moving them around, shining real light on them, putting them into battle, and blowing them up. There has been some amazing viral marketing going on to hype up EPVII. Unreal. I wish movie studios still made their props this way. I think they look more real and CGI. Makes me sadder that CGI is used so much now, so much work went into these."
"Even sadder to think that a lot of these models might never be seen again.Chin up, Episode 7 is being made using some modelwork and full size ship sets instead of just CGI sets. They're returning to an older method of filmmaking because Disney fucking understands Star Wars is a nostalgia market."
"Disney does understand tradition to a point, and I kind of figured giving a recent J.J. Abrams video have a full on puppet walking in the background."
"Honestly I think the reason his Star Trek turned out like it did was because he wanted to make Star Wars.Wow talk about skilled artists and special effect engineers. Am I wrong that this is becoming a lost art form. I shed a few happy tears while looking through these. So many childhood memories.[Obligatory post](http://i.imgur.com/3hr03A4.jpg)Seeing these, I don't think anything in sci-fi films has surpassed these designs since.  The originality of the forms and attention to details are astounding.  All the more impressive that these are *real, physical objects*, like artifacts from an actual space-faring culture that in fact only existed in the minds of those who were creating these films."
"It's almost as if ***long ago in a galaxy far far away*** was a sort of truth, standing in for some profound racial memory of human myth and legend buried deep within our collective psyches and only uncovered bit by bit by the thousands of people who helped bring *Star Wars* into our own galaxy."
"These are field photos documenting the archaeology of imagination.mind blowing. The detail is endless. That much detail is a challenge to replicate in CGI, and push it through production and rendering in an effecient manner.> That much detail is a challenge to replicate in CGI, and push it through production and rendering in an effecient manner."
"Your point...?I would think the point is obvious, in that you cant get that much detail in CGI, in an actual production. Since there is a lot of discussion between the merits of CGI and models here. Sure something can be made to look like that in CGI with a lot of work. Would look great as a still. But to actually render the multitude of frames for use in a movie, with everything else that has to be rendered and managed at that detail would be a huge strain, and a challenge. Not completely cost effective yet, at the current time/budget restrained production schedules.That is totally wrong. Have you seen many recent Sci Fi movies? Look at Gravity or Avatar. They easily have more detail than these models.I didnt say it was impossible, just a challenge. Im sure that FrameStore And Weta would say the same thing about their work."
"I suppose my comments are more geared toward US VFX."
"Anyways I think one could still argue that these spaceships and vehicles have more detail than the Avatar Mech or the Gravity Space Station. Not to undermine their work, it looks great. Also keep in mind that those 2 movies vfx were possible mainly because of [Government tax subsidies](http://vfxsoldier.wordpress.com/2013/12/30/uk-vfx-financial-statements/). Going back to my cost effective statement. Hell, R&H went bankrupt and had to be sold while they were winning the Oscar for Life of Pi. Thats a whole other discussion though.[deleted]We've known about the possibility of internal refraction of light since the 1840's. The production of glass clad optical wire for transmission of light was done in 1954. The TV cameras NASA sent to the moon were fiberoptic. The technology was certainly new in 1977, which is why it looked so damn good.Please help me reach my dream :( Hoping for some love and support:"
"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/art-is-medicine-to-my-soul/x/8926927Aaaand that's why we have CGI.  Done in a quarter of the time and looks twice as good at high resolution.I love CGI but you have to admit that this is pretty cool."
"100 Ralph McQuarrie concept art images for the Original Star Wars TrilogyThe ones of the emperor's throne room with the lava remind me of how Gary Kurtz described the original plot of Return of the Jedi."
"Edit: [This](http://uk.ign.com/articles/2002/11/11/an-interview-with-gary-kurtz) is also a *great* interview for any fan of Kurtz, or his movies.How was it going to be different?The discussed ending of the film that Kurtz favored presented the rebel forces in tatters, Leia grappling with her new duties as queen and Luke walking off alone like Clint Eastwood in the spaghetti westerns, as Kurtz put it."
"Kurtz said that ending would have been a more emotionally nuanced finale to an epic adventure than the forest celebration of the Ewoks that essentially ended the trilogy with a teddy bear luau."
"From: http://www.avclub.com/article/gary-kurtz-outlines-original-darker-ewok-less-endi-44162I like it.  I thought the Ewok party was a little unsatisfying.  I'm just going to go ahead and say that all of that happened immediately AFTER the teddy bear luauThis is how it should have ended: http://i.giphy.com/OwkBmpgjxnAwU.gifI wish they developed the Ewoks better."
"Look at the art with them on the coast, more shots of the village, and the *giant fucking troll* attacking them."
"No wonder they build their villages so far up the trees."
"They're stupid teddy bears, yes, but there's a whole civilization of them.  The concept art actually makes them look interesting.>giant fucking troll"
"And on that day, the Ewoks received a grim reminder.The creature was featured in the Ewok Adventure made for TV movie.  I haven't watched it in decades and I'm not sure it will hold up but I loved it as a kid. The two Ewok films are still pretty good, but the special effects absolutely did not hold up well. Still, Noa and Charal (a Dathomiri Nightsister!) from The Battle For Endor are still awesome characters. If you have 90 minutes to spare, you can watch it here:"
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3OpUuCH8scWow, I would have had pretty mixed feelings about the Alliance replacing the Emperor with a queen.  It was The Alliance To Restore The Republic after all."
"But other than that, it sounds great.You could have this:"
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy"
"I always considered the Princess Leia to be have a ceremonial position in much the same way that the modern UK royal family is ceremonial (and that her authority in the Rebel Alliance resulted from her competence and ability). Nope, the Royal Family of Alderaan actually ruled Alderaan (She's princess of Alderaan, as Bail Organa's adopted daughter. Bail is Prince Consort, his wife was Queen.)How much of this lore came about *after* the decision was made to revise the story of RotJ, though? If things had gone differently, our canon would be different. Leia was considered a princess from the original draft. Remember, the original star wars is a classical hero saves the princess fantasy tale.  That seems sort of antithetical to a leader of an organization fighting to overthrow a totalitarian leader and bring back a republican form of government... it's things like these that make me hate the SW EU. Besides what theswerto said, keep in mind that Leia's mother Padme also ruled her planet (Naboo) as a monarch. > Besides what theswerto said, keep in mind that Leia's mother Padme also ruled her planet (Naboo) as a monarch"
"I don't know about Alderaan, but wasn't Naboo some sort of strange elected monarchy?Yepp. They elected a 14-year old girlThat's not EU, that's primary canon, explained in Lucas's notes and used in the shitty clone wars cartoon, and referenced in Star Wars Episode III."
"In Star Wars: The Old Republic it's shown to be pretty damn cutthroat when there isn't a clear heir to the throne, too. like when the united states 'overthrew' the king and installed a definitely-not-a-king president?Maybe that was the point. Here's the new boss, same as the old boss."
"Plus she was already a princess Leia.This is way too nuanced for Star Wars.  People are looking at this through adult eyes.  Yeah, that would have made a more interesting and realistic ending, but think about your 6 year old self watching this.  It wouldn't have worked.> Luke walking off alone like Clint Eastwood in the spaghetti westerns,"
"We might actually retroactively get this in Episode VII though.I'm amazed and elated at how many aspects of the linked concept art exist in the leaked concept art from The Force Awakens."
"~~[Spoilers](http://www.theforceawakensblog.com/?p=130)~~"

[deleted]Honestly, if I had watched that ending as a ten year old kid, I would have hated that movie. Ending the series on a happy note was the good move. I don't know - I think I love the upbeat tone of the original trilogy and think I might have preferred it over the emotionally nuanced finale This would have been the perfect ending to a perfect trilogy. It was at this point in time that George Lucas was losing his creativity as a film maker in favor of money.That sounds too depressing for the capper of a trilogy that doesn't take itself too seriously. There are lots of decisions that go into making a film and I'm not convinced this would have been a better movie - and even if it was, would it be a better choice as part of the Star Wars franchise? I don't care WHY they decided not to kill off Han Solo, for example, but I'm glad they didn't.> really big toy sales"
"And this right here is the #1 reason behind every decision since.Yeah george lucas is terrible story teller with a great idea for a story. Also seems to like money more than art.I don't understand why you can't do both: kill Solo *and* sell Solo toys?You know how they redid just about every scene of the originals with CGI now? Cut out the ewok party and do *this* instead. I don't care. Nothing is sacred anymore about this franchise so they might as well turn that ending into a better one.Me wonders if this will be more explored in the force awakens Me wonders whether the Star Trek reboot will be anything more than a generic space shooter with a few references to a 60s TV show thrown in.> Star Trek reboot"
"oh there's another one?"
"It seems as though that (from leaked plot details at least) The Force Awakens is going to be building off of that ending description.My inner 5 year old's heart breaks at the notion of Han being dead, but my adult brain is intrigued by this idea."
"It makes me so mad every time I hear about Lucas prostituting out ROTJ for more money. Claiming the reason George could've possibly disagreed with his idea is because he's some consumerist hack who only cares about pushing merchandise seems incredibly bitter - I for one just think his ending is worse on its own merit. I dunno...after reading that description, I think I like the version that was made. The only way I see an emotionally nuanced ending working was if Star Wars was an HBO series like Game of Thrones and geared more toward adults.While I wish so many silly little creatures were not introduced into the Star Wars universe just for the sake of creating toys, as a child in those days, I'm very happy they did not kill off almost everyone's favorite character: Han Solo. Perhaps his, and Harrison Ford's, immense popularity had something to do with the revisions."
"They could have killed Lando at least. :DMeh. I actually prefer the changed version. Not everything has to be sad. Let them be happy. There's enough sadness as it is in Star Wars.It fits in with the original intention of Star Wars so much better. What people love about it, and what George wanted it to be, was something that captured the feel of classic science fiction serials like Flash Gordon. While it wasn't *exactly* marketed towards children, the essence of such things is still there and very important to the feel of the franchise. (Well, not so much the prequels, but it's interesting to note that many complaints about them had to do with the un-classic-sci-fi-esque features, like the politics and et cetera.)"
"The people that say it's shallow because it is unrealistic are idiots. Something doesn't need to be baldly grim to have depth. It's been praised by Dr. Jonathan Young, for crying out loud! You know, the founding curator of the Joseph Campbell Archives...? *The* Joseph Campbell??"
"The truth is, a story doesn't have to end in the tragedy people are so enamored with nowadays for it to have truths worth seeing. We have plenty of fiction teaching us about how evil can triumph over good, the failure of the latter, and about the painful grey areas of life... Why not have a proper contrast to that? It's hard to analyze a shade of grey when you don't have some white and some black to reference. What meaning can a grim story have if nothing has shown us what the truly good are supposed to look like? Much as an uphill battle as it may be to try and emulate these examples, it's a battle that must be had, lest we lose sight of what is important."
"A look at the good is just as important as analyzing the bad. The harsher things in life are not the only things we need to understand. If anything, the idea that good is out there and easy to find, a default, or even the idea that it is *not*, and that it should be ignored in favor of the greys is a sign that we really do need to be reminded of what it looks like.Yea as a kid I loved the ending they went with. The party at the end of Return made me feel so happy after all the stress of watching Empire, and the award ceremony felt so well deserved. For me the uplifting ending increased its rewatch value by a huge amount."
"I think a sadder, more thoughtful ending wouldn't have left the same impression on me. It would be like a Disney movie ending with the princess dying. Sure it might be more poignant, but you're essentially alienating your target demographic (small children) when the good guys don't win. I think part of the point was that children weren't originally supposed to be the target demographic. Not that happy ending is synonymous with childish, but the melancholy ending might have felt more mature I suppose.I agree completely. The entire series is all about rooting for the underdog, and the good guys somehow finding a way to survive."
"- Rebellion vs. the Empire"
"- Jedi vs. the Sith"
"- Fighters vs. the Death Star"
"- Han vs. space mafia"
"Suddenly doing an about face and turning the series into some weird commentary on realism would've ruined everything the first two movies were building up to. Star Wars isn't high art, it's modern folklore.Of course Lucas made the movie worse because of toy sales."
"The more I read about the guy the more I realize the original trilogy was a fluke, and the guy is just a greedy hack. Looking at the concept art makes me think he was also really lazy."
"I mean, it's like he just took everything he was given, handed it to a costume/makeup artist and said here, make what this guy drew."
"Those concept art drawings are more like exact scenes from the movie."
"Instead of using creativity, it looks like Lucas just copied the artist artwork exactly when he directed the shots.That greedy hack gave away 4 billion dollars to charity.I mean I guess the ending was a tad over kill happy, but I wouldn't care for the killing of Han. I cannot recommend enough to watch all that Red Letter Media has produced about Star Wars, like :"
"Mr. Plinkett's reviews of the prequel movies"
"[Episode 1](http://redlettermedia.com/plinkett/star-wars/star-wars-episode-1-the-phantom-menace), [2](http://redlettermedia.com/plinkett/star-wars/star-wars-episode-ii-attack-of-the-clones) and [3](http://redlettermedia.com/plinkett/star-wars/star-wars-episode-iii-revenge-of-the-sith)"
"(Some parts may be **NSFL** for some people)"
"[Discussion with Alexandre O' Philippe]( http://redlettermedia.com/half-in-the-bag/the-people-vs-george-lucas-and-star-wars-discussion), maker of *The People vs George Lucas*I think it has more to do with his ex-wife.  [Excellent article](http://secrethistoryofstarwars.com/marcialucas.html) if you have the time.I'm curious, was Star Wars that massive by the end or was it the whole that was big? Was just curious if such a nuanced ending would be so highly regarded in the future by the general populous vs. what we ended up with."
"I also like the idea of Luke walking away only because it falls into that whole Grey Jedi thing.[Lucas' reaction to all the sellout comments in here...](http://reactiongifs.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/crying-money-woody-harrelson-zombieland.gif)You're a bit late to the party on that one.Well..... He *did* donate the proceeds of the Lucas films sale to charity..... In my book, he pretty much gets a pass for everything because of that. Also, he sold it to Disney who has been fucking *killing it* with the Marvel movies so far. Whatever. The Kurtz idea sounds like shit.Hey, I'd suck the fuck outta Satan's dick for a million trillion dollars, too, so I ain't throwing a stone.... but yeah, that version would have been much, much cooler."
"I still have nothing but love for the 1st 2 movies.Actually, I remember reading he only ever intended to make the first film, but because of how much it blew up, they wanted to capitalize on it. The fact he has changed not only plot elements of the original, but has mucked about with all of the sequels only proves he has been making it up as he want along. He made a fortune doing it, and despite his fundamental misunderstanding of why fans enjoy the Star Wars universe, has not managed to destroy the fan base, only their willingness to put up with him doing it.His was the impetus to something amazing. His ego just needed to be checked like all of us.I think Lucas is a good story man in some respects, but a poor director. While I like most of the ideas they had for the original ending, I would have hated Han Solo dying. I actually didn't mind the ending to ROTJ (although I have to admit, of all the changes made in the Special Edition, toning down the Ewok dance party to show the fall of the Empire across the galaxy was a welcome change).Eh. I think it was for the better, that Han survived."
"Imagine what a depressing movie it would have been: He is frozen in carbonite, rescued and stumbling around blind, then when he is finally better and together with the love of his life he is shot dead by some imperial jock on a god forsaken forest moon.I liked Revenge of the SithYour dramatically over simplifying things. I hate the idea that a darker story is better. I think that a dead Han Solo and a dark ending are out of place in the 3rd act of a film like this. Empire is the dark' movie and if character are going to die I think it fits more to be in that film. Anyways I excuse the Ewoks and campy ending because the film is still fucking awesome, It still makes sense, it's still fun, plot still works, it's not like trying to explain how the force works. Also if StarWars never Sold Out it wouldn't be the large part of pop culture it has become, and Lucas probably never would have made the prequels...wait....The best explanation for this is one that I read here on /r/movies"
"I don't remember the exact quote, but it basically said that he was amazing at creating a universe in which you're really interested in what happened and the characters involved, but he was a *shit* storyteller and writer. That's why I'm so psyched about JJ's version.> the original trilogy was a fluke"
"More accurately, George made one good film (a new hope) and Irvin Kershner made one of the best Science Fiction movies of all time, in my opinion, that being Empire Strikes Back."
"Empire contains almost all the twists, emotional beats, and striking elements that really defined Star Wars. The tone of the film was absolutely phenomenal, and you can tell all the actors really felt it, all the performances being stellar. That movie was magical. I consider it up there with Blade Runner and Alien.It wasn't a fluke. Lucas only directed the first movie himself when he was young and surrounded by extremely talented people."
"Lucas hates the empire strikes back which fans consider the best of the bunch.now that he has donated all of the Disney sale proceeds to charity, I try to think of the greedy comerialism as just very successful, long term, highly aggressive fundraising.I'd give you that if Indiana Jones didn't exist"
"EDIT: Yes, I know who *directed* the Indiana Jones movies.  But Lucas came up with the entire *idea/character/world* of Indiana Jones.Directed by Steven Spielberg...> Lucas came up with the entire idea/character/world of Indiana Jones"
"Phillip Kauffman.  Speilberg and Lucas wanted a James Bond type in the 1930 serial flavor.  Kauffman came up with Indiana Jones and fleshed it out with Kasdan who added Marion."
"Kauffman is also responsible for the 1978 Body Snatchers and The Right Stuff. > Phillip Kauffman. Speilberg and Lucas wanted a James Bond type in the 1930 serial flavor. Kauffman came up with Indiana Jones"
"Not according to wikipedia:"
"> In 1981, Kaufman became involved with the first Indiana Jones film, Raiders of the Lost Ark, for which he received story credit. While the character of Indiana Jones was created by George Lucas, it was Kaufman who came up with the story and the pursuit of the Ark of the Covenant."
"Or the [transcripts of Lucas and Spielberg's writing sessions](http://nofilmschool.com/2013/08/how-lucas-spielberg-kasdan-created-raiders-of-the-lost-ark)Three words: Howard the DuckWell ya got me thereHe created the idea/character/world of a franchise that could have been very toy-friendly.  The argument doesn't really hold.  Indiana Jones could have been a huge toy dump, with all the shiny gold treasures and old cars and whips and removable hats on action figures, etc.  It didn't really turn out that way, but it could have.This is what I responded to:"
"> the original trilogy was a fluke, and the guy is just a greedy hack."
"I'm more than positive he's greedy.  But Indy, to me, proves that the OT wasn't just a fluke, and that he knew how to capture large audiences attention.  Ever since somewhere around '85 though, yeah.  He lost whatever made him want to do this (besides money)."
"http://youtu.be/eG4W0LbIvW0Spielberg, bro. He directed them all."
"Coming up with a world is easy. Making an engaging movie out of it is much much harder. A lot of the Indiana Jones trilogy was Spielberg, Lucas, and others just spitballing stuff on the fly. > Coming up with a world is easy."
"It's not really not.  But that isn't the point - someone called him a hack that got lucky, and I really don't think that's true.  I do think he is definitely a poor director though.I'm pretty sure Lucas just contributed the basic concept and the name-- he didn't even write the screenplay and Spielberg directed it. Two words - Steven SpielburgSpielberg....directed the Indy movies, which featured a character, world and situation that Lucas himself came up with."
"Not defending Lucas from being greedy - just defending him from being called a hack that got lucky.  Though I think he shouldn't be allowed near a director's chair.American GraffitiIt seems a little disingenuous to credit Lucas with"
">the entire idea/character/world of Indiana Jones"
"just because he had the initial idea. He deserves a lot of the credit to be sure, but [Steven Spielberg and Lawrence Kasdan helped him develop it, and Kasdan wrote the screenplay.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark#Development) The character also drew heavy influences from earlier works like [Secret of the Incas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_of_the_Incas#Influence_on_Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark)."
"Lucas is capable of coming up with good basic premises by riffing on the pop culture of his youth, but the man can't write a screenplay, can't direct, and is [on the record as having made changes to his franchises solely for mercantile reasons.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_of_the_Jedi#Development). He's a greedy hack, an ability to create stories that more talented filmmakers have turned into fully realized movies does not change that.You can find minutes from a meeting that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg had when they were brainstorming Indiana Jones. It's amazing how shitty Spielberg's character suggestions were. Lucas had much more of a vision regarding that film. Reading those notes altered my opinion of him.Or THX 1138 or American Grafitti didn't exist, for that matter. A guy's not necessarily a hack because he doesn't handle unfettered creative control well."
"Some artists need someone around them to say no. Just look at George RR Martin's writing after A Song of Ice and Fire became huge.Lucas comes up with great ideas.  he just can't implement them. He also comes up with a lot of terrible ideas and then surrounds himself with people who won't say No George, that's fucking stupid.>I'd give you that if Indiana Jones didn't exist"
"American Graffiti and THX 1138 are also good films.American Graffiti is great and completely different from Star Wars. I feel like if more people had seen it we'd see a lot less of the people complaining about Lucas. Yes he lost his mojo as he got older but pretty much every director does to a greater or lesser extent, that doesn't detract from the fact that he was once a fantastic storyteller and director. Just because Paul McCartney's recent stuff isn't that great doesn't mean the Beatles were a fluke. People change and what they create changes with them. Constantly attributing the work he put into making some of the most influential and popular films of all time is an extremely unfair and petty way of trying to justify a dislike for him.I'd give *you* that if Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull didn't exist.[This came to mind instantly. NSFW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG4W0LbIvW0)I thought Skull was better than Temple of Doom, and I'll die defending that."
"At worst, it's just on par with it. I don't get why everybody hates Crustal Skull so much. Sure it's not anywhere as good as the first 3, but it's still fairly good. It's got some fun parts and I like seeing Indy finally getting married.That movie needs to be locked inside a refrigerator and have a nuke dropped on it.Crystal Skull was no worse than Temple of Doom.You underestimate the power of nostalgiaBut...but...Temple of Doom had to be dark because George Lucas said so."
"In his defense it worked really well for Empire, but they kept a good balance with that one.FEEL I STEP ON FORTUNE COOKIES.Guess which two of the four films were Lucas-driven. Doom was mostly Spielberg Dude, seriously. I actually made a thread here about a year ago saying the same thing. I've come to actually like Crystal Skull more. Far fewer annoying aspects about it (short round and the woman's constant screaming). >Far fewer annoying aspects about it"
"['Part time'](http://youtu.be/4bwep_FFRwY?t=3s) But... Shoo LaBoo.Actoo canboo Shoo LaBoo?I agree. I hated it fter the first viewing but upon watching the trilogy again, I realised I was just comparing it against the highlight reel I had in my head as a boy. The movies do feel very similar and have those campy cringe moments that we ignored as a kid throughout the series. While I think Temple of Doom is an abhorrent film, all of the Indiana Jones films were fairly consistent though we all have our favourites.It was much worse, and the reason is very simple. Indiana Jones was the lead in Temple of Doom. Character is what focuses movie plot. Indiana Jones was completely neutered in Crystal Skull, and Shia LeBeouf (and I say this as someone who doesn't hate him) was not up to the task of taking the Jones mantle. The movie is impotent.Shia LeBeouf didn't take away any more screentime than Short Round.Sure. But they served different functions as characters. Short Round was the comic relief. Now admittedly I've only seen Crystal Skull once, but I don't remember Mutt being very funny. I think the idea was to create a segue into a bigger IJ franchise. LeBeouf has the bravado and the physicality, but he lacks serious charisma, build, intensity, and the type of masculinity that Ford offers. So he really brought nothing to the table, while dividing the attention of the audience in the way a secondary character would."
"Temple of Doom, in my opinion, is actually quite hilarious, and this is some consolation for the ways it deviated from the other best practices of the IJ franchise. That is ludicrous. The problem with Crystal Skull isn't just the outlandish alien plot, but its complete lack of charm. The Temple of Doom may be far-fetched but it has tremendous pacing, fabulous set-pieces, and a real sense of the exotic that perfectly channels the 1930s serial source/inspiration material.Also, less of Shia Lebouf swinging on vines with horrible CGI monkeys.Nuke the fridgeit doesn't.What doesn't?But why male models?You serious? I..I just told you that a moment ago.On the contrary - I think it's a pretty easy road to poignancy if you kill off a main character."
"I think perhaps he started off with the best intentions and ideas, then the commercialization of it all sort of got to him. You can see how the series became increasingly kiddified as it went along.And it's an interesting situation to think about putting yourself in. You're creating what you may feel is your masterpiece. You've already released two-thirds of it. Someone approaches you with the following options (completely made up numbers to illustrate my point) -"
"1. Make a great last third of your masterpiece, cementing its status as the greatest of its kind. 10/10 ratings all around. Earn $100 million for yourself over the next few decades."
"2. Make a good last third of your masterpiece. 9/10 ratings for it as a whole (due to the letdown in quality at the end). Earn $5 billion for yourself over the next few decades."
"Which would you choose, honestly? I would probably sell out and go with #2.What does 5 billion buy you that 100 million will not?"
"I'm so glad I don't have that mindset.For one thing, look at all the good you could do setting up a multi-billion dollar charity foundation. $100 million wouldn't go as far. It doesn't have to be about buying stuff for yourself if you don't want it to be.An empire, for one."
"Look at Star Wars today. It's a cultural force. It takes precedent for some people over *actual history*. It takes money to build an empire. I think the films themselves built the empire, not the money from the films."
"Better films could have arguably built a bigger empire - but whether or not these changes would have made a better film is up for debate.But the money is essentially what built the Lucas media empire. THX, Skywalker Sound, Lucasfilm and Lucasfilm Animation, LucasArts, Industrial Light and Magic, even Pixar (formerly Graphics Group of Lucasfilm), are all multi-media monsters that were made possible because of huge amounts of money, not because someone chose a more artistic movie ending. If someone with knowledge of the future shows up and starts telling me shit I'm killing him and stealing his time machine.The guy who made American Graffiti and Star Wars was going to be remembered as long as film is talked about, regardless of what he did afterwards."
"Between Empire and Jedi, Lucas adopted a kid, and at that point everything changed. He became someone more interested in marketing toys for kids, and making movies his kids wanted to see, than in storytelling or making movies."
"Except he did donate all proceeds ($4 billion) from the sale to Disney to an institution that serves to better education.  He's a businessman, but I would not call him greedy.The movie THX 1138 was a good glimpse into Lucas's intended movie-making direction. It's intuited in that early work that Lucas saw consumerism as a social controller. That he sold out art for toy profits was hardly surprising.What I don't get, is that if you read his wikipedia article ([here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas)), this bit sticks out:"
">Lucas fell madly in love with pure cinema and quickly became prolific at making 16 mm nonstory noncharacter visual tone poems and cinema verite"
"What happened? What changed his view from artistic integrity and exploring the medium to pursuing financial gain? It's kind of scary. That didn't change."
"PT was all in the visual and its characters were actually noncharactersI've heard his wife was the one who reigned in his bullshit. They split between empire and Jedi. So for Jedi all of his shit ideas came out on top.Make sense - everything that is hated/disliked from the PT is evident in RotJ. As a 10 year old boy I saw Jedi as a decent movie (Fett got hosed,) but as an adult is my last favorite OT. Why does ROTJ always get so much hate nowadays?  Aside from Ewoks and the stupid musical scene it's easily on the same level as the first two.Also the whole bringing the death star back thing was pretty unoriginal. The ending space battle in ROTJ is epic.The structure of ROTJ is disjointed. It lurches around and has transitional scenes that just don't work or flow. I could describe to you exactly the order of events and scenes in Star Wars and ESB but if I tried it with ROTJ I guarantee I would miss out some small scene that I simply forgot was there. Add to that a stupid musical scene, Ewoks and erring too far on the side of slapstick in the humour and it really just isn't on the same level. It's miles above every other fantasy film that came out that year though."
"Also Han Solo's transition into a pussy is complete with ROTJ. George then retroactively went back and altered Star Wars to bring him more in line with it. Who is this mercenary we first meet, shooting a guy before he can shoot him, who ends up stepping aside so Luke can have Leia (after pursuing her for the entire second movie)? That's your take on Solo in Jedi? He's not a pussy. He's grown as a character to be a general and a leader of the rebels. He needed help from the Ewoks, but he literally pulled the entire Battle of Endor out of the ruins, else the entire rebellion would have been decimated."
"Sure, the Ewoks are pretty low on the quality scale, but do you honestly expect Solo to be some kind of ruthless smuggler by the end of the third movie?Neither is on the same level as ESB. More of a testament to how good ESB is.I liked Yub-nub. I wanted it played at my wedding. Got vetoed by the fair lady though.Stormtroopers with lightsabers?! They would end up cutting all their own limbs off!I feel like that picture relates to the [scene where Luke and co disguise themselves as stormtroopers](http://i.imgur.com/Wubzp2r.jpg), but I could be wrong."
"Either way, awesome picture and amazing album.Blasters are no better.  You'll shoot your eye out, kid.and uncivilized If I recall correctly, they were more common originally. It's only later that George made them an exclusively Jedi thing.Good call on his part.[deleted]Really? The arena battle scene was one of the only parts of the prequels that I loved[deleted]that was a great analogy, buddy.The lesson you're trying to convey here is the psychological trigger of scarcity."
"In social psychology, scarcity refers to the tendency for people to place a higher value on things that are difficult to obtain, and a lower value on things that are common."
"So by limiting the use of lightsabers, George Lucas enhanced their mystique and created a perceived value. If you went back in time, you'd see a ton of em.  Kinda like the prequels."
"The real problem I had is in the originals, it's an old man's hokey religion that's long dead.  But it's actually only been dead about 30 years tops.  To have them that prevalent that recently just poops all over a huge chunk of the world building in the originals.  But I guess more jedi characters equals more figurines to sell...Playing devil's advocate, weren't there meant to be around ~10k Jedi in the Galactic Republic? Coruscant, in comparison, had a population of around one trillion."
"Being a movie-goer, yeah, it seemed pretty dense, as we were in the middle of the Jedi action. As far as world-building goes, it makes a tiny bit more sense (if, of course, reaching for such a conclusion)."
"(Source: Google search that took me through a few wikia pages)[deleted]To be fair, the vast majority of the Jedi were slaughtered by the Clone Army. Most of them were overpowered by standard troops, tactics and the element of surprise.  The others were chased around the galaxy until they perished by the hands of the Empire."
"The force, aka Han's Hokey Religion didn't save ANY Jedi that anyone knows about from being killed."
"If you were Han and you grew up hearing tales about an ancient religion that once ruled the Empire and how it was overthrown by the Clone army and followed media reports of Jedi that were found hiding in the far corners of the universe who were executed for their war crimes against the Empire... but the force couldn't save them from being found or being executed??"
"I'm just saying, you might call it a hokey religion too at that point.Power of the Empire. As soon as Palpatine took over as Emperor, he started a gigantic (enormous) campaign to subjugate and cleanse the galaxy. Part of that was snuffing out the idea of Jedi as something legitimate (decades of lead up to the Clone Wars, instigated by Palpatine behind the scenese, already had the public doubting the Jedi). They were also, convincingly, blamed for the entire lead up to the Clone Wars and attempted military coup of the Republic. A bunch of fanatic religious zealots, striving for ultimate control of the galaxy. Terrorists and nuts."
"As a kid/teen on Corellia, Han wouldn't really be exposed to Jedi - as the Corellian Jedi order was very reclusive, he was working as basically a slave for a pirate leader, and the Empire's propaganda campaign was in full force. I can easily imagine that, to him, Jedi were just that weird cult up in the mountains. Add to that, he spent his smuggling career in places Jedi typically wouldn't be, and working for people who would not like/dismiss Jedi (as they used to be law enforcement)."
"So in that respect, I think his statement still makes sense in the context of the prequels."
"*I also think the prequels and the prevalence of the Jedi was sloppy in terms of the original movies, but this is my head-cannon for the poor writing*And this comment initiates my nostalgia module."
"Back in Pre-NGE Star Wars Galaxies, if you EVER saw a Jedi in-game, it was almost unheard of. I spent the better part of a year in there and only ever saw one in-person. It was so exceedingly grindy to get to that particular level that they were almost non-existent. It made for an awesome feeling when you saw that Unicorn sitting in the bar at Mos Eisley."
"The second NGE came out, everyone was a Jedi. That coupled with a bunch of other horrible design decisions caused me to stop playing."
"Good lord, I miss that game. I was a Master Dark Jedi Knight, Doppleganger on Bria back then :)"
"Imperial... grinded 32/32 professions, 6 months of Force Sensitive training/missions and then 11 months of Jedi grinding to Master."
"Took me 2003-2005 to do it, playing 16 hours a day or more."
"I miss that game."
"Master Creature Handler / Master Teras Kasi / Master Medic was my alt, 3 Rancor / Ravenous Gruul / Kyrat Ancient and 3 AT-ATsGod, I'd kill to get into a game like that. Issue is the out-dated graphics and the fact most people would already be so established makes me sulk at the missed opportunity."
"I feel like I missed all the great MMO's. :(I remember reading years ago that the first ingame jedi walked into the center of mos eisley in a crowd and just fired up his saber."
"Everyone went nuts:) I designed the Datacenter/facility that hosted SWG at letterman digital arts center in the presidio in san francisco."
"Was one of my great jobs.Nah, not me. I was an entertainer and a trader. Made my money the fun way.Not really. The last time I played SWG before the CU and NGE, half the server were Jedi, because the ONLY function of whether or not you could unlock your slot was if you had time to grind. By the end of the game, the whole place had been taken over with people grinding Jedi, and there were Jedi EVERYWHERE, and if you weren't a Jedi, you were a BH. [deleted]Yeah, there really was no great way to implement a Jedi system, but the one we got was pretty poor. [deleted]TOR had it's own giant set of issues. And EA was behind it, so it was doomed to failure. They basically made a singleplayer game with a monthly fee, and that doesn't sit well for either MMO or singleplayer audiences. I started playing when they had all of the upgrades? and i thought it was pretty fricken fun to play. The people that stook with it had a superior advantage over the newbie jedi. Which I think was fair... especially in pvp. I could only make my cousin so good. But he couldn't stay toe to toe no matter how great the equipment i gave him. I am still interested on how the original game was. I was pretty successful in pvp and i am curious on how many profession trees there were instead of 7-8. Now I'm sad too."
"I've played many MMORPGs through the years, but Pre-CU/NGE Galaxies was easily my favorite. The community was great, the crafting system was absolutely the best I have ever seen, and the hugely customizable hybrid class system is something I constantly pray will be picked up by another RPG."
"I'm gonna go reminisce about my old guild and cry a bit now...I got confused at first thinking that by NGE you were referring to Neon Genesis Evangelion> caused me to stop playing."
"Caused EVERYONE to stop playing."
"And a decade later my heart still aches for those days before the Force Village/CU/NGEThe economy was amazing. If you didn't want to do anything except be a vendor or dancer, you could do it."
"I remember building a house in a player-run city. It was the most amazing feeling to ride my speeder out from Mos Eisley and have a house near a bunch of other player houses with a city hall. I was the third one on the Starsider server to get Jedi. I was excited but beyond scared too. Permadeath wasn't fun."
"I did sell my account and use the money for a down deposit on a Ford Focus....which was nice."
"Always glad to hear someone buying American.Find your old install disks and head to the [SWGEMU](http://www.swgemu.com) - not all is working but they are getting there. Its legal, its free, and its the game just before the CU came out."
"Also /r/swgemu here on Reddit :PIs it possible to use a soft copy to run the game? I don't have my disk, but I used to own it, so torrenting it doesn't feel morally impermissible.[deleted]I'm gonna post a comment I made when SWG shut down in 2011 because I totally feel the same way. That was years after I stopped playing though."
"Dude... I talk about this game all the time. No one else understands. It was long ago..."
"I felt like I explored every planet, every useless and useful planet. I was on a hunt to be the first Jedi. Although, little did I know, that exploring the Universe had nothing to do with the right way to become one. But the mystery kept me going. I was determined to find some clue among the stars, find the last living NPC Jedi who could point me in that direction."
"In the meantime I managed to get all of the Rebel armor, visit the famous cantinas, make too many friends to remember, build my house and watch a town grow around it."
"I fought (and hated) the Imperials. Massive battles took place among the two warring groups; I managed to come out on top in quite a few. I chose the sniper class, a safe choice - but for a Rebel safety was crucial. Eventually the Imperials were given AT-ATs. And what were the Rebels left with? Distance, strategy, cunning, luck. People complained about the lack of balance between the two sides, but the overwhelming majority agreed that it was the way things were supposed to be. It was realistic, it was loyal to the fans."
"The frustrations made that game (pre-patch, pre-nuke) what it was. Everyone talked about the Jedi like they were a secret, as if they were just under the next rock waiting to be turned. If there was a Jedi, was it even on our server? Once you earned the Jedi character slot, your first death would be your last. You had one shot at it. Maybe the Jedi was in hiding, scared to come out for fear of being hunted down and destroyed forever. I knew that would have been my strategy, popping out every once in a while for a fleeting but legendary moment."
"I was lucky to have a real life friend with whom I could play the game. We were a brave 2-man (well 1 Wookie and 1 Twi-Lek) team. Exploring Jabba's palace together, finding Leia together, playing instruments together..."
"Fighting those damn Imperials together..."
"RIP SWG.Jesus Christ you just made me want to play so badlyThe [gate in #92 is appearing in The Force Awakens.](http://imageserver.moviepilot.com/jabba-gates-the-new-star-wars-trailer-was-inspired-by-epic-concept-art-from-the-70s.jpeg?width=960&height=341)whoa good catchannnnd goosebumps [It's in the trailer as well!

"Also, these are amazing, thank you for posting![All I could think of](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140622112258/shingekinokyojin/images/6/62/Colossal_Titan_reappears.png)What's this from?"
"http://i.imgur.com/CyXl50U.jpgIt made an appearence in Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure, 2 minutes in.Ah, those movies were so bad, but I love 'em.  http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/GoraxDang, I was hoping it'd say what the original story idea was.  Clearly there was SOME idea to have it as a plot point in the movie if there was concept art?  Or did McQuarrie also do art for the Ewok Adventure?"
"Holy shit that guy was talented.  Say what you will about lucas, but he managed to assemble a dream team of talent.  ILM engineers, costume and set designers, Ralph McQuarrie (and a few other artists but mostly McQuarrie), and John Williams basically MADE the movies.It would have been somewhat more believable that the the empire got its ass kicked on endor if they had to deal with one of those things in addition to a bunch of creepy teddy bears. Bro do you know how dangerous sticks and rocks are to stormtrooper armor??[Shit, where did I park?](http://i.imgur.com/cOyNywU.jpg)McQuarrie is really the guy who created the look of the Star Wars, and it likely would have been much more generic scifi without him. Ben Burtt, the sound effects guy, also deserves a lot of credit. These guys are as much responsible for the look and feel of Star Wars as Lucas.Came here to say this. It's incredible how the images ended up giving the original trilogy that special look and aesthetics, that Star Wars look to machinery, scenery, architecture, characters, etc."
"Of course, props have to be given to the people that were able to replicate this concept art in the movies with incredible precision, to the point that they are almost the same.Agreed, and I think John Williams also played a huge role. Best film score ever in my opinion.I think the Imperial March is one of the best examples of a good use of soundtrack in film. It gives you everything you need to know about Vader and the Empire: it's grand, powerful, militaristic and villainous. And also first grip Theodore Teddy Sanchez. He really dollied the fuck out of that camera. As a fellow grip. I agree with this statement.I really hope the new movies use this style as a guide."
"btw, i just learned that If you add /zip after the url, you can download the whole album as zip file. There's also a download link to the right of an album for those that don't wanna use their keyboard :)You can tell they're taking a lot of things from this to use in the new movies.  Like the first one that shows the X Wing.  It looks exactly like the one in Episode 7.The new ball droid is also the original concept design of R2-D2. If R2 had been designed as the ball droid I don't know how I'd feel about it.  I think I would hate it a lot.Aww, we'd all love it. I bet that if he actually was a ball droid from the start, we could never imagine R2-D2 designed any other way. We would probably be weirded out by the idea of him having wheels and legs. That's true.  It's just odd to think about.Episode 7..."
"I love the sound of that. Do ya big boy?  What about... THIS!! VII. Yea.  Does that do it for ya?"
"VIII don't like Roman numerals... Well now I just feel like a slut.I came here to say this. I did not know this. Thanks for the tip.[Here](http://imageserver.moviepilot.com/xwing-composite-we-have-a-new-x-wing-abrams-latest-star-wars-episode-7-reveal.jpeg?width=2016&height=1458) is a comparison of the two different X Wings.The trailer shows 4 enginesThe engines are circular when the wings are closed, but the split of the wings goes through the middle of them.Ohhh I did not see thatThank you so much for this!"
"Every day is a school day.[deleted]The *Illustrated Star Wars Universe* is what you're looking for. It contains most of these images and turns them into stories based on reports of many planets in the Star Wars universe from Tatooine to Bespin, to the Forest Moon of Endor."
"http://www.amazon.com/Illustrated-Star-Wars-Universe/dp/0553374842/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1420735128&sr=8-1&keywords=illustrated+star+wars+universeI don't have the answer off the top of my head but I can tell you where you should look."
"The best way to learn about all previous script iterations is to pick up JW Rinzler's Making of Star Wars, Empire & Jedi books. They're $12.99 on Amazon for Kindle versions. Obviously the hardcover version is the best if you have the money, but they're spendy and harder to come by but if you just want a great read on the development process (including earlier scripts) plus bonus audio/visual content, that's the route to take.With regards to the Coruscant concept work, I believe that the final showdown between Luke, Vader, and the Emperor was originally intended to take place on the Imperial Capital, hence all of the concept work for that planet (it wasn't named Coruscant until Timothy Zahn decided to give it a name for the Thrawn Trilogy)."
"Some of them were later used as inspiration in the EU novels.  The black temple on the island, for example, became the Temple of Exar Kun on Yavin IV in the Jedi Academy Trilogy."
"[The Illustrated Star Wars Universe, by Kevin J. Anderson](http://www.amazon.com/The-Illustrated-Star-Wars-Universe/dp/0553374842) also provides some EU backstory to concept art that ended up not being used for anything in the movies.Are we sure the Coruscant pieces weren't for the prequel trilogy? I honestly don't know, I just had no idea that George had ever conceived an imperial capital before Coruscant was created in the EU. I have always given Timothy Zahn complete credit for Coruscant, not just the name, but that's just what I've read.Positive.  If you look at some of the Coruscant concept art, you can see images that are clearly indicative of Vader and Luke.  And the concept art has definitely been around since well before the Prequel Trilogy."
"If you look at the behind the scenes section of the [Wookiepedia entry for Coruscant](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Coruscant), you can see that the concept dates back even to Episode IV.The name Lucas used until Zahn came up with Coruscant was Had Abaddon, by the way."
"Glad he went with Coruscant.The guy in [Number 3](http://i.imgur.com/ApcvbTr.jpg) kinda looks like the young [Uncle Owen](http://www.rebelshaven.com/images/Lars/Owen002.jpg) in Episode II & III.What the hell? Is that Joel Edgerton? It's been so long since I've seen the Prequels, now he's a big star.Rose Byrne is also in Attack of the Clones playing one of Padme's hand maidens. And I think Dominic West and Richard Armitage are in Phanton Menace playing Naboo soldiers!Don't forget Keira Knightley as Padme's handmaiden/Queen decoy in Episode I.Very good point, and to add to that I just remembered Sofia Coppola was a Handmaiden in Episode I as well.Two death stars?  Now youre just being rediculousIt's there to tow the other death star. just wait till you see the death pillar. when all 3 combined, the two death stars charge up the plasma, they point the pillar at the target and then they shoot the plasma through the death pillar at the target, leaving it covered in hot sticky gooEarly scripts for ROTJ did, in fact, have two new Death Stars...Surely a pair of Death Bollocks require a Death Penis!why build one when you can build two for twice the price?-S.R. HaddenOne  just for spare parts.The Emperor left it parked on the lawn. There was a bee's nest in the tail pipe.Dammit Coryantrevor, I told you to take care of that bee's nest last week!In the death star business we call those donors.I'm really glad they never had Luke encounter or fight monsters on Dagobah like the images seem to indicate. It would have taken away from the mystery of the terrain and the 'dream' sequence under the tree, that is, encountering the fact that the real monster is within himself.I have a collection of some of these in physical print that were handed down to me by my mother. I think I have an album of them somewhere..."
"Edit: Found it! http://imgur.com/a/7vz48#0Dude...those would probly fetch a pretty penny in auction...did you have them appraised yet?Nope, I haven't. You think I should?Yes! I have the Return of the Jedi set. I wish now I hadn't pinned them to my bedroom wall as a kid, but at least I did it pretty neatly. Just a small pin hole at each top corner and I still have the box. YOU HAVE A SET?! I haven't found word of any other set in existence, or rather none for sale or advertised as being owned. I'm glad to know someone else has some, even if it is a different set."
"Mind uploading some pictures??As promised - here's my gallery of the Return of the Jedi portfolio"
"http://imgur.com/a/k3RU8These are f***ing amazing!! I'm so glad you uploaded them, thank you!"
"I wonder if there's a redditor out there with the episode one version?Yeah I can upload pictures when I get home later tonight.wicked coolRight? I love them...Wow! How big are these. Everyone is asking where they can be found.I don't have them on hand at the moment to measure, but from my research I'd say 14 by 31 or so."
"Where can they be found? I have no idea, my mom gave these to me when I was a kid. She got them as a child around the time Star Wars first came out. When and where did SHE get them? No clue.I've always admired the Star Wars vision. Minimalism in the shapes, never too much detail, and a lot of bold colors. So many new games, movies and digital paintings are overloaded with details and it spoils the look. Never gives the eyes time to rest. This stuff is so bare bones and bold. Basic shapes abound."
"Also, I hope we see riot shield stormtroopers in the next one, that is a great visual. [deleted]The original X-Wing art looks a lot like the X-Wings in Episode 7."
"[image](http://i.imgur.com/Vg1VQFX.jpg)That's because that image is what they based the new X-Wing design off of.They've been using his work as inspiration a lot. I think Ralph McQuarrie always had a better understanding and vision of the Star Wars universe than Lucas himself."
"I know, most of these designs were approved and reviewed by Lucas, but so were the prequels...It's amazing the difference that one person makes on a film. You're right, Ralph is THE reason the star wars universe looks the way it does.  If you look at the three new recent movies, you can see what those crappy ILM designers contribute to the product.. That's why every Hollywood scifi movie looks the same, shiny, overly busy.... It's always the same crappy inexperienced designers from the major vfx houses."
"Ralph's sensibilities were so amazing, so sophisticated, deceptively simple.... Just unbelievable.To be fair, and this could be because I grew up with the prequels, I think a lot of the ship designs, planet designs, and characters are still pretty great for the star wars universe. I mean, I don't like the prequels, but I still get nostalgia when I see some of the planets or ships from the prequels. Just my two cents. It's not apparent in these concepts but whoever (the model designers?) made the decision to put all the dirt and grime on everything really set Star Wars apart from anything sci-fi. I think it added a lot of realism as opposed the the usual sparkling white and chrome at the time.ummm...Ryan Church, who made the concept art for the prequels, is one of the best, if not the best, concept artist working today.  he did a fantastic job of maintaining McQuarrie's aesthetic while bringing his own industrial knowledge to the table.  there's only one thing I love about the prequels, and it's the designs.  you can blame the fx team for the glossiness of which you so disapprove.  but I will not abide any negative comments about Ryan Church's work.His art is far more complex and in my opinion, needlessly so. It looks much more like cgi. Even some of the most graphically intense movies today, like transformers got it all wrong in my opinion. I don't want to see an explosion of little shiny crystals when a morph happens. I want to see the individual parts moving. And with other movies, I don't want to see so many monsters fight in the rain, or snow, or whatever. I want it to be easy to see what's going on.I agree completely with all but your first statement.  a lot of his concept work for the Star Wars prequels incorporated the cleanness and sort-of minimalism of Ralph McQuarrie's original designs.  but I definitely agree that most heavily CGId films have too much going on to tell what's happening.  I hated Transformers for that reason.  well, and the writing, acting, direction, and pretty much everything else, but that's another can of worms.I don't see how that's the fault of the concept artist. That's a problem with VFX and animation. The concept artist doesn't get to entirely dictate the look of the film, in the end the art director/director is the one making them go for a specific look. look at how unbelievably similar the ralph maquarrie concepts look to the movies'. I think something is up here that I'm not understanding, because if you were to ask me, I'd swear that the concept art was mimicking the movies' design and not the other way around.The sets and everything were probably built around the concepts, otherwise there'd be no reason for 'concept art.' It'd be more illustration. huh? But you can clearly see that the models and actors are exactly the same. It rarely goes that way with concept art.Models they can make based off of concept art and they could have told them which actors were going to play the parts before filming and give them multiple pictures of them for likenessYou can see the way McQuarrie used depth to imbue the images with power. These artworks clearly evoke an epic. The perspective and wide shots are absolutely everything to the images. They are the special effect in a static painting.Why didn't they get him to do or approve the concepts on the prequels???  They had a lot of time to get that kind of stuff together.  It always bothered me that the scenery and technology in the prequels seemed more advanced than the originals.He was retired, they wanted him to but he turned it down."
"Doug Chiang's art for the Prequels is actually pretty fantastic, very much in the spirit of McQuarrie"
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEvmoOgH8CUWell a good majority of them appear to have been replicated almost exactly into the movies.Is concept art drawn after the parts are cast? Luke looks too much like Hamill in these drawings for them not to be.After the first movie they had a visual language to follow.I'm truly sad you can't buy high-quality prints of these somewhere. If anyone knows where (and please don't link Ralph McQuarrie's website, you can hardly buy any of his Star Wars stuff there). I think I'll have to find some underground printer who would make prints for me without asking any questions.Does anyone know where to buy large prints of these. I have been looking for a few months now. [Best you can get at the moment](http://dreamsandvisionspress.com/ralphmcquarrie.aspx)"

Doesn't look like luke...or was that scene cut from the movie somehow?"
"Edit: googled about mcquarrie some more and found this (http://m.imgur.com/mKECzsE)  ...should be the iconic scene when luke learns about the truth...hope"
"it fits right there with the original post...respect.mcquarrie...RE: Vader, that's just a happy coincidence. In various previous iterations of the New Hope script, Darth Vader wasn't the father of anyone, least of all Luke Skywalker (who in one draft was essentially the Obi-Wan role, and the character in the Luke role, Starkiller, already had a father while Darth Vader was unrelated - read The Star Wars graphic novel for one interpretation of an early script.)"
"It's a play on the word invader just as the Emperor's sith name is based on insidious and Maul's is... well, maul. Count Dooku's sith name is based on tyranny and so on and so forth.That's really cool and interesting that Starkiller was an idea that long agoTyranus in French sounds like tire-anus which could be translated as pull(the verb to pull)-anus. So Dooku is literally hauling ass.I believe the oxygen mask guy is supposed to be the hero, that concept art was actually part of the first movie before the hero was really determined so it could either be Luke or Starkiller.How does Dooku fit into tyranny? I feel like I'm missing something haha.His Sith name was Tyrannus or something like thatHis sith name, he means.  Lord Tyranus.Count Dooku's sith title is Darth Tyranus His sith name is tyrannus Oh shit... DUH. Thanks!"
"Just too used to referring to him as Dooku. lol.I keep seeing his shit name Sith names weren't even in the films until Episode I; I like how in the original movies, Vader's name was Darth Vader and they simply called Palpatine, The Emperor.  It's kind of ridiculous to think of these ultra-bad guys sitting around coming up with evil sounding nicknames for themselves and each other."
"A bit annoying that something that has some kind of fit like that vader being father suddenly is taken as obvious truth and is spread like so. I've heard that dark father story at least 3 times from different people and will likely keep seeing it.I have never seen these before; the [sparkling white spires of Aldreaan] (http://i.imgur.com/WO96ug2.jpg) is hauntingly beautiful and they [break my heart.] (http://i.imgur.com/iWerqWi.jpg)"
"Of all the little things I feel could've been done better in A New Hope, Leia's lack of despair, shock, or mourning during the Death Star attack and in her cell, made the production more shallow than it should have been.And that's just the capital."
"Further afield are amazing places like [Crevasse City](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080325165011/starwars/images/c/cf/Crevasse_city.jpg) and the beautiful vistas of grassy plains and [Killik mounds](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20070807214627/starwars/images/0/00/RMQ-KillikMounds.jpg).I hope Abrams starts off one of the trilogy movies as a flashback on Aldreaan."
"Sort of like the way Peter Jackson started the Fellowship of the Ring with that awesome scene where Sauron cleaves through a few dozen guys with one swipe of his mace before getting the ring chopped off."
"Aldreaan with the Death star hanging perilously in the sky. A bolt of light shoots from it and the planet is torn asunder only this time we're watching it from the surface."
"Not sure how that would fit into the new plot but it would be a neat way to inform the audience hey the Empire is bad, in case you forgot.Luke has one too many hands in that one picThose Y-wings and A-wings are neat."
"What's that bone-white spider thing?I forget the name but it is a type of roaming juvenile tree. A mature species of this tree will shoot off the roots all nice and calcified, those spiders roam and walk around looking for a prey. Once it's deemed satisfied with a clearing it plants itself and becomes another tree."
"EDIT:It's called a knobby white spider and they come in a variety of sizes. Luke is known to have encountered many smaller ones in his training TIL Star Wars had Ents.Does anyone know what technique he used to paint those? acrylic.. oil, other13/100:  Secret of Mana vibe.I wish a Star Wars movie came out with this exact illustrated, animated look! [Vader looks so much more fit in the conceptual art and toys than in the movies](http://imgur.com/ujKpJFL,HNWUMGz,SElfx3H)That's a re rendition of it by a Japanese artist, not original star wars material.Even in the painting Greedo shoots first.They released little portfolios with a number of these, 21 I believe, as prints as part of the movie release. Yes they did! And my friends and I picked up one of them in near mint condition from an antiques shop, we each have 4 of them. They're awesome work. Wow this brings back memories. I had this set of prints when I was a kid. If I remember correctly, they came in a book but were not bound, each print was a separate page. So the B-Wing was suppose to have two pilots? It was suppose to be a kind of heavy fighter-bomber or gunship from what I'm gathering. That's really awesome, I just wish we saw more of them in the movies.Maybe? I think the Y-Wing was supposed to be the heavy bomber.I think that's what the B-wing was originally designed as also, but now it's  a fighter-bomber that's armed to the teeth to knock out enemy capital ships.B-Wing was a Y-wing that could defend itself from fighters, even dogfight. More of an improvement on the YwingThey don't resemble themselves at all though. The A-Wing was more of a dogfighter than a B-Wing, least in RoTJ and SWBF2.A-wing was an interceptor, B-wing was a fighter bomber so yes. But the bwings would bomb their targets and could then help out their fighter support whereas the Y-wing just had to run awaySeriously! It is one of my all time favourites!They did actually make a two-seat B-wing in the EU, the B-wing/E. But I think those were tandem seats (one behind the other), not side by side. But this design is really awesome. God I love the B-wing so frigging much.Huh, I'd never even noticed that."
"The B-Wing is generally depicted as a big fighter-bomber with a focus on anti-capital ship work, but this would've made it even larger (the cockpit seems Falcon-sized). Very interesting.I just wonder how effective a B-wing would be in a dogfight with, say, a TIE-Fighter. It is a **fighter**-bomber, and I think it would do alright, but I don't know for sure.Wouldn't be very effective at all, according to various books and games."
"While it can defend itself, mostly by having a ton of weapons and very good shields, the emphasis is definitely on the bomber part. A skilled pilot could probably deal with a TIE or two, tanking hits until he got a good shot but for most missions there'll be an X-Wing or A-Wing escort to deal with fighters."
"The B-Wing is an awesome ship, and a very cool-looking design, but its primary mission is pretty niche: Killing big ships and being so good at it that it makes people wonder what the big ships are good for.I also imagine it's good at blowing the shit out of anything, really. But primarily big ships. Any idea how many B-wings it would take to kill, a normal Star Destroyer? Like, 16? Maybe?Something in that ballpark. Two squadrons (i.e. 24 ships) could probably do the job, provided they can concentrate on it and aren't being hassled by TIEs.Really? That few? Star Destroyers are fucked then. Just give them an A-wing escort, and they'll take that thing down quick. Still wish we saw more of them in the movies. Hopefully we'll see them in the new movies.If they're well flown, maybe. That's one of the B-Wing's biggest problems, it needs a skilled pilot. Aside from that, they're expensive to build and an absolute pain in maintenance because they land all folded up and lying down."
"And apparently the B-Wings didn't get much as much screen time as planned in Episode VI because the thin wings were difficult to film in front of blue screen.Yeah, the filming techniques back then were alright, but they sadly couldn't pick up the B-wingsI guess we will never see Yoda levitating a giant spider, damn it!!Now I know where this comes from http://www.kotous.com/artfx-statue/luke-vs-vader/ . I wish I had bought it when I was in Japan, now they are too expensive to come by on ebay."
"Where was this guy? Would have been kind of cool to see."

Cool alternate take on the character.Sorry for my ignorance, but whose the women on the capital ship with Admiral Akbar and the whole gang?http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Mon_MothmaNot ignorance; the movies never named her.

"amazing. http://i.imgur.com/9WXTX2a.jpgJudging by the scenery they're alternative concepts for the temple ruins on Yavin. It's the place the rebel base was at during the ending of a new hope.Gentlemen, we can re-shoot it. We have the technology. We have the capability to make the world's best action space opera. Star Wars original saga will be that movie. Better than it was before. Better...grittier...deeper.[Peter Quill](http://i.imgur.com/ZRhYfSI.jpg).I'll never understand why these studios dont package and sell these concept art drawings more often.  My eyes just kept getting bigger and bigger...it left me wanting moreRalph McQuarrie basically created the star wars universe.Everyone who hates the Episode VII X-Wing design, look at number 15"
"Wow, I'm just completely at awe of the grand scale of things...I'm surprised how close these images are to the actual sets and etc in the movie. So many times the art is nothing like what the finished product turns out to beDoes... Does that storm trooper have a light saber??I remember seeing a lot of these in Starlog magazine when I was a kid, and they were discussing this cool looking up coming sci-fi adventure flick called Star Wars. It was in issue #6 or something."
"I be old.Whoa, what the heck is the story behind this [thing] (http://i.imgur.com/CyXl50U.jpg)?Too much awesome. I can't handle it in one sitting.Is that the fucking Gorax appearing in Jedi? That would've been kinda cool.Is that a cell phone in the 5th pic?[Looks like C3-PO is having a good time](http://i.imgur.com/z7MY2aq.png)Something about that second picture (real or concept) always gets to me. Scrapper, salvager, droid maker, entrepreneur. Jawas are so underrated. All of them seem spot on, but the last ten or so I was like Show me more!!Does anyone know what technique he used to paint those? acrylic, oil, other?I don't know about McQuarrie specifically, but most illustrators from his time period were painting with gouache or acrylic."
"These have a very gouache look to them. It's basically like opaque watercolor. It was favored by illustrators because it dries very fast, and totally matte (making it easy to photograph), and unlike acrylic, gouache paint is reworkable if you rewet it. Gouache tends to have pale flat darks, as seen in McQuarrie's paintings."
"I'm pretty sure that most of these are in gouache, and a few are in acrylic. The Force.Curious....the female rebel General (many Bothans died!) with Ackbar looks like the actress who actually ended up playing her.   Wonder if they cast her first, then had McQuarrie do concept art or went with someone who looked like McQuarrie's art.Since most of McQuarrie's pre-production work for Return of the Jedi was never used (he spent most of his time on that film designing the Imperial home world that you see at the end of the Imgur gallery), they had him come back after principal photography was completed and whip up some paintings based on scenes that'd already been shot so they had McQuarrie artwork depicting events from the film people would recognize that could be used in art books, calendars, etc."
"That's why his work on Jedi looks so much like what appeared on film, unlike the stuff he knocked out for astar Wars and Empire.As Bono would say, 'it's even better than the real thing.'they look like jodorowsky's dune (moebius) concept art.I actually have four of these hanging on my wall!"

"My friends and I picked a portfolio for ROTJ up at an antique shop on the side of the road a couple summers ago. We each pitched a couple dollars and we each have 4. They're really cool, and in great condition. In homage to this image (death star hangar bay with 'clouds' outside) :"

"Can you imagine the sights youd see out of that? Holy hell, please tell me there is somewhere I can get large size prints of these. I would frame soooooooo many of these.Yeah I'd like to know that too!Were these made before or after the film, because some look just like the actors.aaw man. why didn't we get stormtroopers with riot shield and lightsabers?Damn. Too sickThat A-Wing was really cool!"
"What was this? [Jiant Elf Thing](http://imgur.com/G1vP6zk.jpg)I used to have a book when I was a kid that was like a behind the scenes production book for empire strikes back. Had all sorts of photos and concept art, a bunch of which is in this thread. So cool. These will look so beautiful on my desktop. Cheers!I love seeing the art made for star wars. It always makes me excited for new movies or what can be done."
"But I want a MoFo Jawa flea market. Seeing an empty cargo bay and everything spread out could make for some really cool scenes.If this is concept art, why do some of the images of main characters look EXACTLY like the actors portraying them? i thought concept art would come way before choosing the actors so you'd think the characters portrayed would look a little different. The Dark Vader in #77/100 looks so aggressive and sleek. In the movies he's so rigid, doesn't look like he could fight for shit.Thank you for all the new wallpaperDoes anyone have these in a super high res? They'd make some great backgrounds.incrediblewow, this guy is the true visionary behind it all.Not enough hilt lightsabers.Are these all done in charcoal?The interior of the Tie Fighter and the targeting system in image 12 is totally bad ass. Great artwork.I don't have the words to thank you. Just awesome! I would be proud to display any of these in every room in the house.  dear god Everyone should see these, but if a cartoon was to be made using these images :O !!!!! best animation in history.It's amazing how very 80's all of it feels now.Image 22 is really cool! It makes Hoth/Echo Base look industrialized and more permanent. I loved how Empire came out, but this would have been very interesting.i'm looking very much forward to seeing the new 3 Star Wars movies. can't wait! These concept arts make this even harder.Does anyone recognize the very very last image in this collection? I love it, but don't know it.When making concept art, are the artists working with specific design ideas already? Did Ralph McQuarrie know have guideline for how everything should look or did he create concepts on his own or a combination of both? [Too bad this scene got cut from episode VI](http://i.imgur.com/CyXl50U.jpg)I want all of these framed. Somewhere in my house that I wish I had.What's amazing about these is that they look like they were created *after* the movies were made. What imagination.I find [#99](http://i.imgur.com/FhvIFpv.jpg) to be the most absolutely haunting and eerie one.There were Stormtroopers who did use Lightsabres. I think they all got killed by Vader after a failed uprising.Who can explain to me what in the name is happening here?"
"http://i.imgur.com/CyXl50U.jpgHey now, that storm trooper has a lightsaber. Everyone get angry!I like how the X wings in episode 7 resemble the original RMC concept more then the original trilogy versions.  whoah...they actually thought about having a 400 foot creature on Endor? Dang"

"Thank you for this OP , this is porn for all SW fans.Wow they really stuck close to the concepts, especially that bespin exhaust tunnel and the jabba palace.Does anyone else get the feeling that George Lucas sort of wrote the plot and universe mythos as he went along?these are so fantastic. it makes me think how awesome star wars could have been using this art style as an animated series of movies. I picture them as dark and more adult, kind of like the movie Heavy Metal (1981). He has a card in the Star Wars Customizable Card Game:"

"(relevant username!)I realize now that every design in star wars, from costume to creature to architecture to landscape was masterfully created.Wow! These look more like they were contrived from the final cut of the movie rather than the other way around. They did a great job going from concept to reality for the film.Very nice."
"So coolimage 77 why does this look so familiar???"
"Luke fighting darth with what looks like scuba gear on?You guys I just love Star Wars so muchThey issued some of these as cards. Source: I just found mine next to the ones that came with bread(I think?)Obvious, but I must say, I really love the space ship design. It's sad he won't be around for Episode VIIThose were amazing! All I can think of is how long each one must have taken. They're all masterpieces in my mind. I think I like this art even more than any of the moviesAwesome collection!You can buy some of those from the Star Wars Portfolio folders that came out in the 70's.  Plenty on fleabay.  I was lucky enough to buy them for 99p from a market vendor...looking back I should have bought them all for that cost!Interesting to see that the lightsabers were originally concepted to be a colourless blade.I'll bet Episode VII ends up being more star wars than the original trilogy.This is fucking awesome!Kind of cool that after all the years between the originals and the prequels, Lucas kept the designs for Coruscant and Kashyyk pretty much the same.  [#16](http://i.imgur.com/jKsgTpt.png) looks like pod racers.Wouldn't it be awesome if they released an animated series drawn in this style? McQuarrie is just as integral to the series as Lucas was. Almost everything you see is his work. It's absolutely amazing to me how much of his early, early concepts made it into the final films almost unchanged.Wow... Some of these add a depth to the universe that I really would have liked to see in the OT. Hopefully they'll take advantage of some of this in the new films.Can anyone shed some light on the Yoda-esque creature with black hair that seems to be attacking the Ewok village?  When I was 7 and first saw Yoda in ESB for the first time, I thought Yoda might secretly have evil intentions given some of the threatening nature and tone of his comments (You will be as a response to Luke's, I'm not afraid). Perhaps my inner child is just enjoying this too much right now..Damn, these are awesome! Is there some place to get prints ordered of these or something like that?"
"I wish there was an art image for how Yoda can't know that the Senator was a Sith Lord.Upon first seeing these, I thought these are way too similar to the movie, this can't be concept art..."
"I googled, I was wrong. Ralph McQuarrie actually designed a lot of the characters on Star Wars.I was thinking the same thing.Amazing stuff. Thank you.I think the weirdest thing is that Luke still has his hand after his fight with his Darth Vader in #44.Give me a 2 hour movie with just still of his work and his commentary, and I will be happy. Absolutely beautiful work. My favorite one is the Ewok running in front of the Teton Range.I feel like this artwork could easily fit into MTG cards.I got the first set from the first movie way back in '78. If anybody knows if they are worth selling, feel free to PM me. :-)Now if only we could get all this in a nice art book. Seriously, why haven't we got a complete Ralph McQuarrie Star Wars concept art book?Were all of these concept art or did some get drawn after the movies?  The one of the rebels in their command central before or during the assault on the first Death Star seems to show Carrie, Mark, Billy Dee, and Harrison as opposed to most of them which just show random humanoids in those roles.Welp, I just found my new wallpaper album.[Woah, what the fuck?](http://i.imgur.com/CyXl50U.jpg)These are absolutely fantastic.I'd like to watch Star Wars now, please.I was given a bunch of these for Christmas in 78 or 79.  Can I find them now?  No, no I can't. I remember #6, 8, 11, and *maybe* some of the other ones.  They were about 8x10 and came in a little folio.More like 100 dope wallpapers I love the type of art style in movie concept art. I'd love to see an animation using this styleThese are gorgeous.I'm so glad they didn't include the giant spider-thing in the original movies...

"This one ends up being in The Ewok Adventure. Ooooh Ralph McQuarrie went to my school! Seen a lot of his work :DWell ive got my wallpaper folder for 2015 nowOkay did 78 get used in the movies?  If not, what is cool about that picture is it used as a place inn Star Wars the Clone Wars animated TV show.  If I could find a picture I would but the plaza shows up in the Second Season, Episode Duchess of Madness.Holy cow these are almost immaculate story boards. some of these concepts are practically exact shots in the films. So he was the first person to draw the giant boob nipple gun. Welp, looks like I have 100 new wallpapers.I love how Gorax showed up in the original concept art. Awesome!To this day I still find it a bit silly that the rebels developed AT-AT walker tripping technology.Is there any way to purchase replicas of McQuarrie paintings that I can frame and hang up?  He is the absolute best.How did you get these?!So they made all those sets and scenes to be 100% directly lifted from his art?"
"Or is it not concept art?[nope nope nope nope NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE](http://i.imgur.com/oj6tI3S.jpg)Amazing stuff! I loved every one."
"Thank you for sharing!And yet, they surrendered to a ragtag group walks and a few rebels...This stuff was all part of this really cool SW book I used to have. They incorporated the art into like a fake journal of explorers visiting these worlds and documenting what they found.  That knobby white spider always freaked me out.

"So cool to see the whole collection!!"
"Edit: Just noticed one of the ones i have is not here. If i remember ill post it here after work.All the best points of ROTJ are thanks to the excellent story and character development up to that point. It was good because we finally got to see Luke become the Jedi knight he was meant to be. But a lot of the story elements are out of left field and feel completely out of place:"
"* Yoda suddenly dying of old age. There wasn't any real hint of him being near death up until that point, and it was pretty much just done to further emphasize Luke is the last Jedi."
"* The attack on the Imperial base on Endor was clearly meant to be a suicide attack for the greater good, where Han would die to save everyone. There was really no reason the Ewoks should have won. This would have put great pressure on Luke during his confrontation with the emperor, when he mentions how all his friends are dying."
"* The rebel fleet jumps into a trap where they are largely outnumbered. It seems pretty obvious that their losses should have been very high, and a bitter sweet victory with the death of so many rebels, and Han."
"Instead we get multiple victories with no real cost or scale of what is happening.That storm trooper holding a light saber. Hints towards shadow troopers planned way back then?"
"In http://i.imgur.com/QdcabsA.jpg shouldn't Luke's hand be missing?If anyone is interested in comics, there was an adaptation of Lucas's original script, [The Star Wars](http://www.amazon.com/The-Star-Wars-JW-Rinzler/dp/1616554258), the art is often inspired by McQuarrie's work.This is fantastic! Several more can be found at the [Tumblr page dedicated to McQuarrie art](http://recklessishe.tumblr.com/), too!This is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen..Dem tittie cannonsthese are very cool!I love how the pilots are looking out of window.

Probably because of the cinematic limitations at the time."
"My opinion :-)Is 13 the temple from the beginning of Jedi Academy?Wouldn't be surprised if a lot of these influenced the new films. Some aspects (the snow troopers and the old x wing) are already making their way into rebels/ep7. Hopefully that old a wing concept gets new lifeI adore his worksome of these can't be 'original' concept work. some clearly look like the actors (hamill, fisher et al) and the ones in Jabba's palace with the fucking abomination CGI singer added in the special editions are clearly done after the fact, no?"
"other than that, love thisWhat a fuckin' treat. What is Star Lord doing in picture number 4?"
"Edit: I know it's not actually star Lord. Chill out.Ok so what's the point of these *beautiful* concept arts if the movie is going to look nothing like them!? Imagine a movie that actually looked like this, it would have been incredible. Anyone know where I can get some quality prints of these?Just amazing. Many of these exact files (plus more) are found on the official Star Wars twitter, tumblr, facebook, and google+ accounts from last year. Some are faded or their colors are off, however. Just a little FYI for everyone."
"Also, here is a very expensive book of Ralph's on [ebay] (http://www.ebay.com/itm/Star-Wars-The-Art-of-Ralph-McQuarrie-2008-Japan-Exclusive-Softcover-/181614494534?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item2a49114346).savedhe drew these before production started?E#verytime I see these I feel outright JEALOUS. I wish I had such an imagination and the pulse to bring them to life so well."

"Can't buy Creativity in a can. No, creativity isn't taught."
"Near anyone can learn the trade, barely anyone can make great, new concepts."
"It's the same with music or anything else really, even STEM.looks like a lot of unused stuff was used for KOTORWallpapers... Wallpapers everywhere!Ha! The Kashyyk treehouse is literally the establishing shot for the Holiday Special... Man, those guys came up with nothing on their own...Well that's kind of the job of a concept artist though. Get paid to give the film makers key shots of the environments and scenes.There's a book out there with most of these pictures in it as well as some pretty interesting text. The Illustrated Star Wars Universe by Ralph McQuarrie and Kevin J. Anderson. I highly recommend it!Awesome Star Wars drawings.So the concept art had Luke Skywalker drawn to look eerily close to Mark Hamill?"
"Interesting.I noticed that as well, also Mon Mothma looks dead on with the actress who portrayed her.That's not that surprising.   Most of the artwork where he looks Hamill is from Empire or Jedi.   I'm assuming that by that point that this artwork was produced, everyone had seen the first movie, including the artist and knew what the actors portraying the lead characters looked like.Note the changes in C3PO's design to closer match how he appears in ANH. I prefer the more alien original design.Yeah, the weird part for me is that he had the costumes and hair figured out already in some of them. Looks like he may have been commissioned for promo artwork as well?[This article on starwars.com - An Annotated Guide to The Star Wars Portfolio by Ralph McQuarrie](http://www.starwars.com/news/an-annotated-guide-to-the-star-wars-portfolio-by-ralph-mcquarrie) is worth a read as it touches on many of the drawings/paintings here.  It also shows some alternates such as the following:"

"Edit: Article titleI have a framed painting of the third one from the top.  its pretty fucking sweet.These are gorgeous. Having said that, I think one of the best things Lucas did with these designs is just soften them ever so slightly. Any clues as to the picture near the bottom with the Jedi decked in gear fighting Darth Vader? Is that supposed to be Luke (assuming yes)? If so, that wardrobe is just amazing.Wow...lots I've never even seen. ThanksWhat is the giant thing looking at the Ewoks?!Looks like the troll from the Caravan Of Courage, Ewok movie.  Maybe it was thought up then dumped, and reused for the Ewok movie."

"http://i.imgur.com/yl625rQ.jpgThanks for your post overflowing with dopeness.I'm not even a big star wars fan but these are so fucking cool. [#2](http://i.imgur.com/ApcvbTr.jpg) reminds me this [Diablo II artwork](http://us.blizzard.com/static/_images/games/d2/wallpapers/wall2/wall2-1600x1200.jpg)I prefer these hand rendered paintings to the hyperrealistic synthetic images that now saturate the motion picture business.Most concepts you see don't represent the actual creative process at all. That was way more fantasy than sci-fi.  Wouldn't it be cool if they tried to emulate the old films special effects in the upcoming movies instead of CGI it to bits. Thought the older ones were more organic. They had so much soul.  This shit is better than whole movie hexalogy.Any of these 1920x1080?I like the shot of Luke hanging from the antenna with both hands intact.I wish I could live in that world.These are all SO awesome.I remember growing up, we had three original Star Wars prints, similar to these, hanging in our living room. When we moved, they were nowhere to be found and we believe our uncle stole them to sell for drug money. He does that shit all the time and wonder why my family puts up with it.*spice moneyWhat is the name of the ship that appears in the first image of Cloud City? My grandma has always had the toy...

"Now will someone tell me what's going on in #20?Is there anywhere online that I can watch the originals?Holy fuck that spider one is creepyAwesome, those are way cooler than the actual movies Whatever it is that's eating the Ewok village -- can we encourage it to work a little faster?these original images make it look like a bad 70s scfi novel you find in the Salvation Army, but its the dedication to the project with so many other people involved which really brought it to life.In my opinion, McQuarrie is the man responsible for Star Wars, not Lucas. Do you mean before or after sequels were planned?If Jar Jar is not in the movie then it's not Star Wars. Awesome!!! Its so revolutionary recently i've started watching the Clone Wars series at seriesyonkis.sx"

Doc also appears to be spooning Marty a little.I came here looking for this.  He's really all up on him. Feel that?  That's my penis, Marty!I need you to lick my balls, Marty!

"EDIT 2: Anyone recommend a site to host hi-res images? Would prefer not to deal with IMGUR in the future, album is really lagging.Damn dude, I've been collecting these slowly as well but your collection blows mine out of the water. Repost if you manage to post them all, especially the behind the scenes ones, I wanted to frame them for my walls.Any other Blade Runner ones :)?Like everyone else said, throw them together in a .rar and put it on MEGA.  But let us know when you doooooooont! Just FYI that one is definitely temple of doom with harrison ford.I sent you a DM. For hosting you could use Amazon S3Well, if my site weren't dedicated to video game images and not movie images, I'd say PidgiWiki, but I don't know of a good movie equivalent.Would you consider uploading your collection in native resolution onto a torrent site? That might work better for distribution purposes."

For example, my full quality [Fallout 4 album](http://imgur.com/a/1hv4d#0).I gotta second this, /u/Join_You_In_The_Sun. This was a remarkable effort, and I hate to see it degraded any by the image hosting (though I'm still grateful, regardless). There's about a dozen of these I'd love to blow up and frame.Any alternate site you recommend to host the images?you could upload them to a public google doc"

"I've got some bad news... Megaupload, making a torrent of the folder, or Flickr are all good recommendations I'm seeing others make. And thanks again, these are incredible. I've been searching for a poster for The Thing for years and not found one I liked that wasn't insanely overpriced.If you make a torrent of this I will seed the shit out of it.OP, please make it happen!My wife got me a full sized Thing poster that I have framed in my basement home theater."
"She claims it's an authentic from-the-80's poster but given that it came from ebay and was in pristine spotless condition and perfectly rolled without so much as a scratch I'm assuming it's a replica."
"Still.... makes an amazing poster. You sound like you've been holding that in and just needed to let someone know that you think the poster your received may not be a real oneI've mentioned it to her, it's not a secret, it still hangs proudly in my theater."
"If anything I mention the authenticity because that was the thought behind the gift. It was meant to be an authentic piece and she paid a good price for it (not crazy though) and I loved the effort she put into it."
"It seems a disservice to not mention the intension behind it while also feeling like a disservice to not mention my doubts about the same."
"You could say I have mixed feelings.At least you got to let it out, but I'd go ahead and not really talk about that with her in the future because nothing positive can really come out it, at most her saying I messed up which isn't a position you want to be in. Still cool though I've been thinking about getting a few prints for my roomDid you painstakingly photoshop out the text, or did you somehow get the artwork before they added the text? Very impressive either way.I just looked at 80 classic movie posters and of all those the one I'm gonna end up watching tonight is Big Trouble in Little China. I just love that movie so goddamned much.You can go off and rule the universe from the grave...or check into the psycho ward, whatever comes first, huh?[The raddest poster IMO](http://i.imgur.com/F44er6q.jpg)  Yeah, this is the one I wantWho?"
"ME. Jack Burton.you know what ol jack burton says at a time like thisWhat the hell.Apocalypto has one badass poster."
"I also love the Nightcrawler and Leon posters - I guess I have a thing for face closeups with sunglasses reflections.and looking up people's nosesand staring at skin pores and counting the hairs. Gotta admire the HD quality.Awesome collection, love when modern movies do this style of poster.  Like the Inglorious Basterds or this [Bone Tomahawk](http://www.ew.com/sites/default/files/i/2015/05/08/bone-tomahawk.jpg) one. My favorite random Kurt Russell trivia."
"In the Miracle commentary, (I forget who exactly says it) Herb Brooks wife commented that I didn't know Kurt was a lefty like Herb. He's not, he just learned how to write for the part."
"Something about that stuck with me, and I'll watch any movie with Kurt.Oooo bone tomahawk, new name for my penisThat Bone Tomahawk poster is incredible. Never even heard of the movie. Is it any good?I always raise an eyebrow when I see 'starring Patrick Wilson' on a movie poster. There are good movies, bad movies, and movies starring Patrick Wilson. Patrick Wilson movies *feel* like bad movies. But I can't figure out why they feel like bad movies, because they aren't 'bad' in any way I can quantify and he's always perfectly likeable in them. But there's always something off about them."
"Or is this just me?Patrick Wilson movies also featuring Matthew Fox, and you're playing Russian Roulette, but only one chamber is empty.Matthew Fox's post-Lost career is incredibly depressing considering I thought is performance in the show was pretty phenomenal.I thought he was great in The Conjuring."
"Plus he made a good Night Owl in Watchmen. He even gained weight for that role. Two perfect examples of movies that have some sense of weirdness and mixed reception around them.  I like Watchmen, but there's a part of me that feels like it's probably a bad movie that I like anyway, even if it's not.not yet released.Made some new desktop-background-image-wallpaper-things, with some of my favorites from this post and decided I wanted to share, 1920x1080p http://imgur.com/a/CpPJkHOLY SHIT. Nothing but trouble. I forgot that movie existed.There was a lot of removable noses in that movie. Ugh.  That movie scarred me when I was a kid.BONESTRIPPPAAAAAAAAAWeirdest movie ever made. yea, me too. It brought back a bunch of weird memories as I saw it on t.v. one day when I was like 11. I mentally associate that movie with the word, gross. Same experience for me. I had pretty much completely forgotten about it until now.I really enjoy The Thing's poster. The flash of light and the mystery about what it is supposed to be just captures your imagination.And all done in one night after a four minute phone convoWithout even knowing what the movie was really about and not having seen one single image from it. Struzan is a goddamned master.Scariest movie I've watched. Made me paranoid. No other move made me that paranoid for that long. Couldn't sleep."
"Most scary movies don't really affect me.While I'm no horror aficionado. I watch A LOT of horror. pretty much all I watch these days is old horror. The Thing is by far my favorite horror film. That's the whole point of the movie. The Thing is aptly named. It can literally be any*thing*. The fact it is an alien is largely irrelevent. The horror, the tension, the terror comes from the humans. It comes from the fracturing of their group, from the paranoia, from the isolation they feel (reinforced by their isolation geographically)."
"I was once told that it's a metaphor for HIV/AIDS; that works too, but I believe it's a metaphor for anything that divides and sets man against man. Its about the base creature that is man: what happens when we fear for our lives, what are we when we put our civilisation and decency behind us?Have you read the original novella that The Thing was based on, Who Goes There,? It's very well written, and captures everything that you were talking about very well. Just Google it. I would link it, but I'm on mobile at the moment.Mostly, I'd rather not spend the rest of this winter tied to this fucking couchI had forgotten that line! Yes, that is the best part of the movie!LEOOONNNNN!This is, hands down, my all-time favorite post in Reddit history. Thank you.i'm blown away by it. And just think what amazing stuff he has in the 50 gigs he didn't show us yet!That 1st *Vacation* poster is really a masterpiece level spoof, and I'm not even sure of what.  Maybe the original Star Wars poster, or maybe that one just resembles an earlier trope I'm unaware of."
"EDIT: So I went googling, and it seems like it's not a spoof of a particular poster, but the work of the same artist who established the style, turned up to 11 for comic purposes.   Very effective!"
"https://mubi.com/notebook/posts/movie-poster-of-the-week-national-lampoons-vacation-and-the-posters-of-boris-vallejoHa, I was just commenting that it looks like a take on Boris Vallejo, and then saw your edit. I have one of his art books. He's really quite good.He did a few excellent Magic: the Gathering cards in case you were unaware.  That's how I found out about him. https://mubi.com/notebook/posts/movie-poster-of-the-week-national-lampoons-vacation-and-the-posters-of-boris-vallejo Basically Boris was paid to poke a little fun at himself and a style he helped inspire.While the painting was done by Boris Vallejo, that pose was popularized by Frank Frazetta -- a major, major influence on Vallejo."

"How would one go about getting a blown up poster made?I work in a large format print shop. Inbox meI would start by buying a poster at a nearby Walmart, and then some kind of firecracker.(real answer: go to a FedEx Office, they will help you)This depends. They may ask for copyright release from the artist. Or if they don't care, they'll just print it. This is interesting in seeing what type of art style works best for me as far as advertising goes. I really enjoy the picture within a person, like Inglorious or Enemy, or the extreme close-up picture, like Leon or Nightcrawler. Agreed!  In my case, I like those which depict some kind of scene.  It gives me a sense that the film is valued by its plot or premise.I don't believe that's an accurate depiction of ~~willow~~ Warwick Davis. It Follows surprised me with how good it was. Very creepy.I've seen that poster before, but never noticed the shape of the smoke when there was text.> but never noticed the shape of the smoke when there was text."
"On a lot of these I'm noticing things I'd never seen before because of the text. There's something... odd with the Alien poster. Like there was patching done that wasn't quite feathered in. You can also see a repeat in the star pattern along the bottom, and it has been taken from about 2/3 down the photo on the far left hand side. Come to look at it now there's quite a few little patterns repeated. Probably a byproduct of someone removing the text from an original poster?"
"A few others seem like they could have had the text removed as well (Amadeus, Animal House, Brazil,Hook etc). Still all great posters though, thanks OP.Anybody know how I can blow these up to hang on my wall at quality?Just realizing how genius The Exorcist poster is. Awesome collection.Greatest movie poster of all time in my opinion.Does anyone know of a program or app as the kids call it to print large wall sized versions of these?

I'd work on it for an hour and then slide the progress under my bed.  I was almost done with it.  My brothers and I got into a fight and they separated every piece."
"I had completely forgotten about that moment from my childhood until I saw that image."
"Be right back, I have to go finish a fight.Step 1. Make 80 hi-res, textless posters."
"Step 2. ???"
"Step 3. Profit!Thanks OP I needed a new background"
"http://imgur.com/tjarbZ0Can someone explain how difficult it would be to get these printed out on actual poster paper for display in my own house? Am I running into any copyright issues by not just doing it myself?Leon the Nightcrawler.You're doing a great service to us OP, these textless, clean posters remind me just how incredible the artistry really is on these posters. I want them more than any normal movie poster. If you ever release more please let us know, our upvotes will be standing by.uhh DELTA HOUSE IS TEXT!  Just kidding, bro, these are awesome.Once my browser finally stopped crashing and loaded all of the images... Amazing. There's not enough wall space.I'll be back tomorrow, when everything's loaded. I have no desire to see Vacation, but I love the poster.That movie is hilarious. You really need to watch it.Accidentally loaded this through 4G RIP my dataGreat Scott!God DAMN, Kurt Russel was a handsome man.These were awesome. Thank you op Any way we could get these with the titles, but without any of the other text? A lot of the titles are part of the artwork. Now I want to rewatch Willow in HD, just to cherish that scene where Madmartigan kicks down a door and finds an arsenal of elvish weapons, which he uses on the soldiers and trolls.Not a WOMAN?!Guys, a quick LPT:"
"If you take a hi-res poster as a PDF to your local print store, you can get full size movie posters printed up for REALLY cheap."
"I got an A2 poster for *Jodorowsky's Dune* printed for 60p ($1). ...some of these would be better with the text..."
"Seeing a lot of those brings back memories, bittersweet."
"Noting the Muppet Movie poster, a lot of the actors and actresses shown there are passed away, so it does strum one's heartstrings a bit.With a handful of exceptions, a lot of these juts don't work without the text. The posters seem off balance or just off. i agree and its because these were designed to have type, the type is essential to the poster. Look at the animal house one, it just empty space below and it looks like it should be cropped off, same goes for Big Trouble in Little China and Back to the Future. They look cool and all but the type really brings it together.Nooooice!!Great collection. Thanks for sharing.Would love to see more of those. Particularly The Contempt poster (not Le Mepris but the american one I guess)."
"Anyway all of these are awesome The Fog is absolutely gorgeous!Wow awesome!rip bandwidthExcellent! Thanks a bunch.This was just fun to see how many I could name let alone the great art work, thanks.damn this is money! ThanksI love those Back to the Future ones. I love it, thanks OP.That Nothing But Trouble art is way too good for the movie it goes to...and I love that movie but omg it's bad. Amadeus!!!  Fuck, that movie is amazingThe cover art is awesome but totally misleading. Whenever I used to see that at the video store, I would think it was some new anime and get disappointed every time.I felt the same way!  I look at it like, oh look at this cool cartoon movie, then turn it around and there is a man with a white wig on (this was when I'd go to blockbuster, back in the day) finally I watched it and fell in love, I could not believe the same lead actor in Animal House(Tom Hulce) also played Mozart in Amadeus and F. Murray Abraham is just brilliant. No no, now I'm not saying that I've been everywhere or done everything. But I do know this is a pretty amazing planet we live on, a man would have to be some kind of fool to think we're all alone in *this* universe. -JackThanks for the Return of the Living Dead II art. I love that image so much.So many great images ruined with pointless text. Thanks for these.Saving this. Not sure why I'd ever need it but, saving this. Can I just say, OP, that I love you right now.Ten thumbs up! I will put them to good use over at  /r/photoshopbattlesIs it already safe to click imgur links?Great post, OP. Only thing missing would be artist and year. Thanks. And agreed, wish I knew all of the artists. Will try to include them next time.I feel like I could use these for something but just don't know what.Dude! you cant stop now! And where is They live?[deleted]I never noticed that trick they did with the three Back to the Future posters until now"
":sI really love how the series are grouped together. I like seeing how they evolve so simply displayed :) Jaws is my new phone background!"
"Edit: I never realized he has such snaggly teeth. I know it doesn't apply to all these, but I really think it's almost become a lost art of painting Movie Posters.  I like the aesthetics of it far more than modern photoshop approach.This is awesome, the NOES: Dream Warriors poster LOOKS SO COOL Any way to get this in a file so I can have awesome PC backgrounds?http://imgur.com/a/ibs1o/zipI think it's pretty safe to say that the James Bond posters are by far the most impressive. Also, props for throwing in Nothing but Trouble. That movie is an incredible hidden gem, and it's completely retarded.I really wish they'd release a big elaborate hand-painted poster for every modern Bond movie."
"007, the bond girl, some action scenes, the bad guy, all thrown into one over-the-top poster just like they used to."
"I know it would be silly and not really work as a real advertisement but I think it would be a fun throwback and could definitely sell a lot of prints.I facepalmed at The Night of The Living Dead. Of course her arm's come off and the rest of her's skin and bones but thank god her boobs survived being buried!"
"The majority of these are really gorgeous and I'm surprised it's not something studios release as posters anyway. If I like a film I'm usually put off buiyng a lot of newer ones because of the text or how it's obviously just the front cover blown up. Could you host, post these somewhere in full resolution. Would love to mount 32 inch tv vertically and use as a changing poster slide show in a media room. Posts like this and contributors like OP are the reasons reddit is great. Thanks for this. Never realized how great and interesting some of these posters are.As a typography enthusiast, this post is a bit unsettling. Really cool stuff."
"Using the Interstellar one as my phone BG now, looks amazing."
"Thanks very much for this.I was just looking for a hi-res textless version of The Thing's poster! Thanks OP!How do you find text-less posters? is the text digitally removed or do some movies actually have both a text-less poster and official posterMost artists who paint a poster leave a blank spot for titles and the block. So they all start off without text - sometimes on official artist sites you can find high qualities of the originals other times someone carefully photoshops out the text. It dependsThank you for this post.  There has been a movie since my childhood that I have been trying to remember the name of and because of this post, I now know it (Nothing But Trouble)."
"My parents really like Labyrinth and Nothing But Trouble when I was a child but I have nothing but bad memories of both movies since I had little understanding of what was going on and the visual are bit much for a child to comprehend. It's amazing how much attention the title text can take away from the image itself. I'm noticing things in some of these posters that I never have before. Thanks so much for these. I love Bruce Lee and Kung Fu movies and now I get to have Enter The Dragon as my phone wallpaper. It's my Favorite Bruce Lee movie."
"I wish I could give you more than am upvote. You made my week, thank you.I guess I never realized that most of the movie posters were drawings.  Very interesting to see how much detail actually goes into the creating of these.[deleted]Themoviedb.orgHoly grabiods that's a lot of wallpapers for my phone. I miss paintings as movie posters. They have way more creative leeway to mess with things and styles that photographs just don't have. Plus I'd like to see more artists employed!We need the work! Please won't you think of us?"
"-a poster artist who still paints his stuff (me)"
"Honestly though special edition blurays and shirt designs seem to be the only place were wanted anymoreAgh shet , I already viewed them all... got any more of dem posters?

Is there a Top Gun poster? [Here you go!](http://i.imgur.com/Y8Z9xyP.jpg)This is incredible. You've provided me with enough lock-screens to switch them out weekly until I'm illegible for social security. And some of them are amazing to see in here... who knew Nothing but Trouble had such a badass poster!Dont mess with textless.The Bodyguard has never looked better.Delta House"
"How did you manage to find these without text?Someone beat me to it, but this post made me notice the similarities between Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Rango."
"http://social-creature.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/rango-fear-and-loathing.jpgMan, what a find, these look great!"
"For some reason I don't remember the Apocalypse Now poster being a testicle-headed bird crapping on Col. Kurtz, though. What's happening there?I'm not old enough to know a good chunk of these movies but nothing like some awesome posters to get me watching and drawing. thanks OP!These are all great Ok, I want these, add in the Dark Knight trilogy posters, printed in poster quality and framed. Some one make it happen. I'll payAre these there for the benefit of all mankind, Or should we pay someone to use them?real cuteThe first one i swear looks like it should be Alienware.Lots of good tattoos in there. I haven't thought about nothing but trouble since I was a kid. Christ was that a weird movie. Early 90's isn't all nostalgia. A lot of Roger Moore Bond movies. No Connery though. Hell even Lazenby. [Gotta admit, I was sad to not see the newest mad max poster here. :\(](http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMTE0ODcxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE4NDQzNTE@._V1_SX640_SY720_.jpg)I know what our 3.2m large format printer is doing tomorrow...where's the browse gallery button that used to be on imgur? was it removed?Has anyone seen Dark City? Is it any good? I've always been into sci-fi so I feel like this may have been something I should have seen already. Remember loving it in theater, very cool vibe to it all. Not sure how it dates or compares to Director's Cut however.Anyone knows who did the Labyrinth poster? It looks kind of like Ian Miller or Philippe Druillet.New phone wallpapers for the next couple of years! Do you actually have any high resolution files? These are all just 72dpiBro, I'll suck your dick. No homo.How would I go about getting one of these printed? As bad as the He-man film was, the poster was pretty amazing. can someone help me to understand the Amadeus poster? I've been seeing that since I was a kid and it has *never* made sense to me. I don't think of classical music when I look at it. if I had to guess the type of movie base on that image I'd say some sort of dystopian scifi movie about an evil dictator or something. As a 27 year old this is the best post I've ever seen stoned. Having VHS rental flashbacks from my old local video store. Video Trek, I was so fascinated by the old VHS covers. Especially for Godzilla. If ya could find those OP oh my damn.I can't get away from how much I love the Amadeus one I might use something from it as a tattooHoly shit, I had never before noticed that Princess Leia on the A New Hope cover looks nothing like Carrie Fisher.These are very nice,  thanks OP!"
"Does anyone have one from The Big Lebowski? Moar...pleaseThat Interstellar one is so high res I can crop it as a desktop wallpaper. Thanks OP!!!Thanks for some of my new phone wallpapers.Great posters, /r/JamesBond as wellMade a couple of [1920x1080 Background Images](http://imgur.com/a/G8cLB) from my two favorite posters if anyone is interestedCan anyone tell me What films 13 and 19 are please?I'm really glad Kingdom of the Crystal skull didn't show up after Last Crusade as I was scrolling through these on my phone Can someone provide a mirror for those of us with imgur blocked?Fuckin A man this is gold.  Dirty Harry is just ridiculously awesome IMO.Two things I noticed: Dogma's poster isn't very good,the characters faces look out of proportion and The Frighteners might have the most terrifying poster I've ever seen.I never noticed this about the Goonies poster, but Chunk is clearly looking up Kerri Green's skirt. Totally in character."
"Also, that Dirty Harry poster is boss.Whoa.. never noticed that bulge in the Big Trouble in Little China poster... I'm sure it is from the knife but damn what placement.. SO many good ones, damn this was a great gallery.Is there an equivalent gallery with HD posters with the titles?Some of these could easily be metal album covers.Man I wish I had these when I was still in a band. Easiest Concert flyers ever.You know when you save a post before even looking at it?What's up with George Lazenby's left hand?"
"I thought that freak was a model or something.Thank you!! As a graphic designer, I love finding stuff like this!!Thanks for the Robocop and Big Trouble in Little China"
"Do you have Predator (1987)? Total Recall (1990)? Escape from New York (1981)? The Running Man (1987)? Red Heat (1988)? Over the Top (1987)?"
"Christ! sorry, i can't help myself O_o"
"Escape from New York (1981)(https://filmfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/escapeposter.jpg)Some of these pics are really great. Thanks!If it hasn't been mentioned yet, noticed quite a bit of art from Drew Struzan in there (The Goonies, BTTF, etc...). For those of you who like this stuff, I watched a great doc about him and his movie poster quest called Struzan - check it out. I watched it twice. Nice Really awesome... (Good job)Phone wallpapers for daysssssIs there any way to actually get posters like this? Would be awesome on my wall.Is that Taylor Swift in the right of the Moonraker poster?I just now realized that the number of people next to the DeLorean on the Back to the Future posters is equal to which part it is (original gets one, Part II gets two, Part III gets three).Thanks for this /u/Join_You_In_The_Sun."
"I'm a huge fan of all of these.It is not very often that I actually save something, but this has been saved and I plan on using this for discussions in the future. I'll just go ahead and join the OP circle jerk. Woah, anyone else notice that the building in the center of the Blade Runner poster looks like the millennium falcon?The Star Wars ones are all so beautiful.heard of r/movieposterporn ?This will prob get buried but I'm sad that OP never mentioned Drew Struzan, the artist who created a lot of these posters."
"Theres a great documentary about him on Netflix called Drew: The Man Behind the Poster (2013), well worth a watch if you enjoy this kind of art. RIP my bandwidth.Me too! http://imgur.com/iYHUQqv thanks op!i think there's mistake on Apocalipto poster. the guy in the front is not protagonist - it's a aztec warrior. you know the one that's being a douchebag to everyone......[Return of the living dickbutt.](http://imgur.com/2c2rHkt)Do you have any of the other Connery Bond posters?

If I open these am ingoing to end up accidently DDOSing the universal pictures website or something?"
"^^I'm ^^actually ^^kinda ^^ok ^^with ^^that...i wonder if the original artists felt like the text had spoiled their masterpiece A lot of these were drawn by Drew Struzen"
"Excellent documentary on him: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1486843/ This reminds of a project in Art Class during High School: we had to create box art. Essentially, take a box, like a shoe box or something bigger, and create an art piece within that box."
"I went with pop, layering cut-out drawings I made of a an old Coca-Cola ad along with a retro, sky-blue retro Cadillac."
"I'm not much of an artist, but I imagine a few of these would look awesome with that staggered effect, particularly Star Wars and the Indiana Jones posters."
"I remember the movie Vantage Point, about an assassination being viewed from different perspectives, had a cool layered standee which looked like an eye from the right angle."
"Anyway, I'm rambling, cool shit.What I would do to spend a weekend hanging out with Drew Struzan.  That Empire Strikes Back just sings childhood to me. Always was my favorite poster."
"OP, if you have any others hidden in your archive, I'd love to see the '86 Transformers the Movie movie poster. I wish there were a way to download all of these at once. These are amazing btw.That Frighteners one reminds me of the LP artwork for [St. Vincent's Strange Mercy](http://i.imgur.com/rxVzB.jpg)Do you have any for MM:Road warrior or FURY Road?I have some for Fury Road."
"http://imgur.com/a/6u5ICAmazing post..... just missing a Cannonball Run poster, just saying.Forgot to turn on WiFi when opening this.

Thank you.saving for later.Any Stargate?Amazing!Needs more Kubrick.Drew Struzan FTWThose are some amazing paintings in there. I miss the painted movie poster."
"Poltergeist is still haunting without the lettering.[this](http://i.imgur.com/HMQfpZa.jpg), then [this](http://i.imgur.com/PlxbhyX.jpg)lol I just saw that there's a spoiler in the Enter the Dragon poster.Love it. Thanks.those make for great iPhone wallpapers, and I'm pretty sure I will print a bunch into posters for myself when I move into my new house."
"Just a great post, thank you OP (if you will eventually find a way to host the hi-res versions, that would be even better, but this is already awesome)Wow thanks op!Man, Martha Plympton really got the shaft on that Goonies poster, huh?Is there a downloadable link? Usually on imugr there is an option but I cannot seem to find it this time around...That Labyrinth poster is exquisite. These are great! I've never really looked over the Nightmare on Elm Street poster until this post and I now see where the New Nightmare glove comes from. makes me wish they were all HD backgrounds :(Did not expect that Dogma one to be so good It's amazing the air and curiosity a painting can create vs pics and photoshopThis is literally my favorite post ever.  Thanks man.this is great,thanksI miss the drawn posters of the 80sArnold Schwarzenegger reportedly was quite the Diva re: The Last Action Hero poster.  He insisted that his hair be changed so that it appeared to be in motion, too.From looking at the poster it appears that John Bluto Blutarsky was played by Patton Oswalt.  Who knew?Welp, I better say goodbye to ~80 pieces of glossy paper and maybe a few cartridges of ink. Best post of 2015 for me :)"
"Thanks man!Amadeus..what does that poster have to do with the film?  Honset question.  I love the textless. I like a lot of posters, but wouldn't want the text for walls. Makes the art stand out.Just FYI - if anyone wants more posters, or is looking for the exact poster of their favorite movie I highly recommend going to a site like this"

"Paste into the search box. Sort by largest image. It'll bring up high resolution photos of your favorite movie poster for free!"
"(then contact me if you want one printed for like $30 and I'll ship it to you... is this legal? I'm only half serious)Drag me to hell was such a weird movie For some of them it doesn't really resonate well with me... but for others its so awesome I don't know why they weren't originally like that![Here's a thread on bluray.com that's been going for four years full of textless movie posters](http://forum.blu-ray.com/showthread.php?t=176706) (you may have to register to view them)This is awesome.

"can someone just go ahead and make all these into a wallpaper!??Drew motherfucking Struzan.I wish the titles weren't visible.  I want to guess on each one!How were some of these made pre-photoshop?  A lot of them from the pre digital era look... Photoshopped."
"Obviously a load of them are illustrations, but I do wonder what old 'analogue' techniques were involved in creating some of these posters. Is that a bird taking a shit on Brando's head?I wonder how many of these are Drew Struzan?TIL, from this post, of Dark City. I love it. Thank you, OP.awesomeI looked at the poster for The Fog and said that guy's got my goddamn blood echoes!DAE find it a little weird that in Episodes 4, 5, and 6 the Millennium Falcon isn't on the posters? I never really noticed until now, but there are xwings in all of them, but not Falcon. You show The Thing in your thumb nail, yet I see no poster for it.That was rather textlessIt just hit me that Revenge of the Sith spoils the ending of the movie in the poster. Fuck."
"Yeah it was a super obvious twist but man."
"What a bummer.Do you have one for the warriors ?Totally made the Dirty Harry as my phone background."
"So happy."
"Punk"
"Nothing But Trouble is, I'm almost certain, the worst movie ever made.I was sad to not see The Fifth Element in there, but this is awesome nevertheless.No Big Lebowski? :(Awesome, now I can make that Back to the Future 2 t-shirt I've been wanting!

All of the airbrush art makes me nostalgic for the 80's. Even though I've seen some of these hundreds of times, I've never inspected them this closely.

I always wondered why, and I see that in 1990 they started doing reverses:"
"http://moviepostercollectors.com/Authentications.htmlNotice how many of these incredible posters are painted artworks, most of which are by Drew Struzan. This guy is a legend. Movie poster art has all but died with Photoshop, hasn't it? They just don't make them like they used to. I looked at the **Alien** one for a second and thought oh, it's all pixelated because the green parts were divided up into interlacing-type lines."
"Then I realised that was done on purpose because it looked *so cool* back in the day.Fucking Jar Jar ruining the Episode I poster.More than anything I wish hand drawn movie posters made a comeback./u/Join_You_In_The_Sun Ah OP this is brilliant. Would you happen to have one of Antonioni's Blow-Up ? Is no-one else going to mention that the Pulp Fiction one is a different picture? She's in a different pose to the classic poster.Some of those poster are really spoily.Did you throw The Bodyguard in there just to see if we were paying attention?"
"When I was pretty little, my family and I were going to the movies and my parents were talking up going to see European Vacation because they loved the first movie."
"I remember looking at the poster and thinking it looked great. The movie was sold out, and I remember acting all bummed, but my folks got us all in for Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. I was like, What the hell is this? And what kind of name is Mel? But I instantly fell in love with it, then proceeded to watch it as much as humanly possible. I love those three Mad Max movies, and I was so happy the new one was great. Great fucking post.I would pay good money for the big trouble in little China to be a posterInlorious Basterds, Dirty Harry and Nightcrawler were my favorite.Posting for later... Thanks OPWhat movie is 21?The Thing is the best! The best horror movie, and the best poster!The Apocalypse Now one looks like a bird is taking a shit on Kurtz' head.Amazing how hard it was to remember some of the film names, even for films I'd seen a whole bunch. They were always on the top of my younger. But I had to look at the name to get it. I'd say a quarter of them were bah! Damnit! Of course'sDoes anybody else miss going to the video store?  So much nostalgia for picking movies  to watch based on the cover art. You had me at textlessHold up. How have I never noticed how gay BTTF 2 looks?

"I'm looking forward to the rest of the alphabet.I think OP may have started a new subreddit. I would like to see Rocky,  Tombstone and BackdraftIf you enjoyed this, you'll love the documentary 'Drew, the Man Behind the Poster'. I'm not particularly into movie posters but I thoroughly enjoyed it."

Man these are amazing Saw the thumnail. YesDid you photoshop all these? If so, nice job man.Does anyone want a desktop wallpaper version of one of these? I may be in the mood to make them.You had me until you got to Enemy and then a flood of memories of how awful it was to sit through that movie came rushing back to me. Harrison Ford is on six of these posters (and in seven of these movies; I could have sworn he was on the poster for Episode IV)"
"bttf3 poster is so beautiful.why is the alien egg opening on the bottom?I never new the poster for Alien had the head of the xeno in above the eggSomeone get me the Ghostbusters...After seeing the poster for Apocalypto, I watched it. I now have a new favorite movie. Thanks OP.Damn, if only they were 1920 x 1080 lolCould you find a lord of war poster without text pretty please.This is awesome! Some of the posters have blank spaces specifically for text, so that looks a bit odd, but still pretty neat![A good number of those are by Drew Struzan](http://www.drewstruzan.com/illustrated/portfolio/?gs=1&amp;type=mp).Willow! Glad that was included, one of my all time favourite movies.Thank you so much OP! These are great!View 70 more photos, You're damn right I will.Blu-ray.com has a thread with these for years.

"Were the other two movies already greenlit when they did the poster art for the first one so they knew that they could use the same template, or did they just run with it after the fact? If it's the latter, the poster for BTTF might be one of the most ingenious movie posters of all time, at least imo.The dogma poster shows them wearing...skates that aren't rollerblades, as they do in the actual movie. Looked up the original movie poster and they've cut off the image just as it gets to their boots. Just thought I'd share that weird thing I noticed.I just looked at 80 classic movie posters and of all those the one I'm gonna end up watching tonight is Big Trouble in Little China. I just love that movie so goddamned much.#24 has text..These are freaking awesomeIt's so big and beautiful that my app keeps crashing loading the album.Reddit All Mighty!

Commenting to keep track of the post Would really love a Blue Ruin one if you can find it in you. I'm already using that as a phone background so a textless one would be great. Obviously the title can stay since it kind of is the poster art.Awesome. You taking requests?Reminds me of http://filmtheblanks.com/Nice! The Pulp Fiction one makes a great phone wallpaper.Do the new one for the revenant Amazing stuffThe text and logotype is half the strength of many of these posters. BOO!Does it make anyone else really sad that movie posters are so lazy nowadays?Is there anywhere I can get Hi-Res version of these. Paid or unpaid. Either way.Not sure if you're holding out for better quality but I found out how to download them all - http://imgur.com/a/ibs1o/zipBetter quality. There are a few I'd like posters of.

"#Welcome to /r/MoviePosterPorn!Anyone know Where could one order these, or would it be possible to take them somewhere to blow them up into actual posters ?Amen to this!.  I want this so bad as well. My empty walls are screaming!.OP this is amazing. One question. Do you have an ultra high-res picture of Boy with Apple? That would be amazing, thanks guys.It's times like this I realize how crap our internet at work is. And almost none of them are just the main characters striking poses against a random backdrop."
"Why do movie posters suck so fucking much these days?Most of them look really bad without the text because the text was a crucial design element.I wouldn't say most of them, but there are more than a few that look really awkward. Hook was the worst for me.Ah, before Photoshop. Good times.If you were a good enough artist you could recreate every one of those posters in Photoshop and you wouldn't be able to tell the difference.There's dozens of artists who paint in these styles who use photoshop."
"Also a few of these newer posters absolutely were photoshopped in some way.Could we get more, and also some newer movies as well? Because this is awesome! I'm working on a project for a home theater which we need movie posters. Would be great to add some classics and some newer movies.  These are great! These are making me realize how well designed the Indiana Jones posters are. They NEED the text.These are fantastic, thanks so muchFor anyone with an Apple Watch, these would be great backgrounds for the new WatchOS 2.  You should cross post this to /r/AppleWatch This guy fucks.Is there any game posters available like this?Great post however I feel like you chose the ugliest possible posters.I was hoping I'd see Almost Famous on this list. Good job all the same thoughFrom what I can tell, judging by the ones I've seen (most of them), this list is full of great movies (short of the phantom menace). Someone tell me, is it worth watching the ones I've missed, and actually expect to enjoy myself?"
"In other words; lots of gems in here, any stinkers I should beware of?I want to take these, print them out, and cover a wall with them."
"Whats a good way to do this? Print them at a CVS?I think it's kind of insane that people don't know this, but imgur re-encodes images of higher quality to save bandwidth. A lot of quality is most likely lost by using them as a host for image galleries like this. Scrolled through the entire list, waiting for everyone to load.  Got to star trek and thought if star wars isn't fucking here, Thankfully I did not have to carry out my sinister plan.  This is really cool! My band played a show in virginia w Shai Hulud on their most recent tour. I had no idea the tour poster was from The Thing. Glad to have found out! Really nice work. Maybe the original Star Wars posters if you have them?"

This makes me so happy.you can literally stroke that with the healing brush tool and it would be fixed.A lot of them also look terrible without text, it's pretty clear that they were designed with the text as the central element and just removing it without changing the poster at all makes it look like they're missing something integral.

Hurt!I think(hope) he's only talking about [the poster](http://community.fansshare.net/pic13/w/richard-taylor--philosopher-/1200/17670_lotr.jpg). I think the movie is a somewhat underappreciated middle chapter, as is the case with many mid-trilogy films. I would love this to turn into a weekly competition where somebody submits a picture and everybody comes up with a fake movie name.This is an excellent idea. Would participate church scene; the secret service BEN AFFLECK SHARTS HIMSELFThis for every single entry.Make it daily so Buzzfeed has more material to play with.[removed]Now how do I get all the ones off of bluray.com all at once?You are fucking amazing!   Thanks for the heads up!I still find it funny that they called it *Devil*. You know, because *Hellevator* would have been just too darn corny.It would have suited the film a lot better then. The thing is, a movie with that title already exists."
"http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0422370/That's not a thingI don't think all movies have copyrights when it comes to names. Take [The Last Ride](http://www.imdb.com/find?ref_=nv_sr_fn&q=last+ride&s=all) for example! I'm sure some movies secure a copyright. Disney does, for sure. Inception probably did, too. But I don't know if fall movies do it. And Hellevator doesn't *sound* like a big budget film.I do love that poster, though.didn't notice the upside down cross until just nowThese are amazingNot sure if it is just me but they instantly become pieces that I could see hanging in a museumThe gone girl one is awkwardly funny.I agree, Affleck looks pretty out of place. I much perefer [this one](https://filmphilosopher.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/2876078_big.jpg).Its taken me YEARS to find that picture from Backdraft. In California, Ive seen people with it on their license plate and always wondered what the hell it was. Upon googling, its The California Professional Firefighters License Plate. I have actually wondered, FOR YEARS, what it was. So, thanks. lol. To me, it's just pure monochromatic elegance. The Batman posters are good too, but the Harry Potter one looks like some made-for-TV flick from the 80s without the iconic logo.Is there an easy way to turn these into full sized wall posters?These aren't probably high enough quality for print at that scale. Also, copyright enfringement and such. ZazzleImages look terrible as full-size wall posters if they aren't significantly hi-res.They work well for phone wall backgrounds.I would imagine that a lot of office/printing type stores will print images in a variety of sizes for you if you bring them the image on a USB. Hell, maybe they take links these days, too. Obviously the lower resolution images will look pretty bad in poster size though.They might not print it due to copyright. I've had my OWN photo not get printed because the photo lady thought I didn't own the picture. Yeah, that's what I was wondering about--if they're available in super high resolution. If I had to pick a fave: World War Z.Yeah, it is brilliant!These are all amazing, especially Django Unchained and Lost in Translation.I can't find one that would be better WITH text. These are awesome. Especially casino royaleThese give such a different perspective on something that we've all seen dozens of times. Thanks for the collection!That chronicle poster huh? Pretty useless without text. Is there an app to make your phone cycle through wallpapers everyday? I'm on an iPhone. the chronicle poster is pretty much an average peak out a Seattle windowWell it's supposed to have the three guys flying, right?Where can I find the text version of the Dredd one? Looks badass and I loved the movie."

Looks like a grab from streetfighter!Your note about the Gone Girl poster made me giggle.The Babadook was one creepy fucking movie.  I loved it.I've been wanting to watch the Babadook but I've already seen the short film that it was based off of, so I feel like watching the movie itself would be a bore having already known the plot twist and whatnot.You might still enjoy it.  But given that it's a suspenseful movie and you already know how the suspense ends, maybe not.Most I've been scared by a movie in a longtime! If anybody knows any movies even close to that spooky let me know!Babadook and WWZ have the scariest posters I think! And Babadook was an exceptional film!Dook Dook DOOOOOK!I feel like I missed something, cause I absolutely hated it. It had some decent parts that gave me chills but I was too distracted by that kid's annoying screams every minute.You probably did miss something.  Considering the babadook as a metaphor for drug or alcohol abuse gives the movie an entirely different feel.I thought the babadook served as a manifestation for [babadook spoiler](#s the emotional burden of the mom from raising a kid alone not having gotten over the death of the husband)I agree. I hated that movie. I left more annoyed than creeped out.Did you watch it with expectations? I went into it with nothing and left pretty creeped out in a different way. Just came across it randomly on Netflix and was like, huh I feel like getting spooked, so I watched itYeah maybe I'm not easily scared but I didn't really find it scary at all. It was just a CGI monster going ooga booga booga and trying to kill a kid I wanted to die anyway. Nice, but would be even better if the titles were at the bottom of the image to turn it into a trivia game as we look at them.Yeah, Seeing these posters without the names actually made me want to watch films I wouldn't have before hand way way more."

It'd be sweet to see a collection of the different Titanic posters that were around in 1997/98.  In addition to the main one, I remember seeing some featuring the scene on the staircase, or the scene of them dancing in the lower deck.  And I'm pretty sure there were a few more.This is awesomeThat Terminator 2 poster is awesome. Something about that bluish hue. Text less movie posters make great backgrounds!

Does anyone know of any websites that will print and mail a poster?Can someone tell me if these are all official? I'm assuming they are. But some of them look like the title could have just been photoshopped out?Most of them are just half decent (some terrible) Photoshop work removing the words.does anybody else just know that a movie is going to be horrible if the poster has a bunch of floating heads on it?"

Do some get released as promotional images or are there just people out there editing out the text? Some of them look too clean to be edited, however there's others like the Inception one where someone did an absolutely HORRIBLE job editing it and parts of the text are still clearly visible and you can see cloned bits right next to each other.I still think Harry's hair isn't scruffy enough.It always pissed me off that the Free Willy poster (and trailer) spoils the climax of the movie. Love them! Great idea to remove the text! The Addams Family is one of my favorites!Beautiful!

Wow, this is awesome!!This post reminds me of how much I dislike collage style posters. Just a bunch of main characters poorly shopped together. Looking in random directions.

Nien Nunb is a very expressive puppet.Because Star Wars rules. Same. Shattering my world one picture at a time. ...wow."
"But, he was seen dancing with the Ewoks at the end of Jedi, so a full-body costume was used in at least that scene, IIRC.Yeah, looks like there was [both](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Nien_Nunb). (Wookiepedia)"
"The character Nien Nunb was realized as a puppet for his appearance in Return of the Jedi. He was performed by Mike Quinn and Richard Bonehill. Mike performed the acting in the cockpit, which was a large animatronic hand puppet and Richard was the extra who was in the full body suit.Does Nunb remind anyone besides me of a Mexican?Star Wars: shattering racial stereotypes one at a time.

"Christensens acting was terrible, but it's not a big stretch to imagine them being father and son."
"EhhhhI'll still defend Hayden as being a fairly new actor who was dealt a shitty hand. I mean, imagine being asked to play Anakin Skywalker? Any actor would jump at the chance. And then you had to act out Lucas' god awful script . . . On top of that, you had to live up to fan expectations that had been building up since 1983."
"Even Liam Neeson and Natalie Portman couldn't make their characters interesting. The script was just horrible. I don't think even Daniel Day Lewis could pull off that love is unlike sand line. The only person who pulled off the character well was Ewan McGregor, but it helped that he and Lucas had a preset image of how Obi Wan behaved and sounded.I don't really blame Christensen so much for the prequels. No one can make that sand monologue sound good.That and bad directing doesn't lend itself to good acting.

"Straight Gangsta JediI think he spent most of the movie [constipated](http://a.dilcdn.com/bl/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2014/02/7-Luke.jpg). You know what I find incredible?  Is that Luke is wearing an almost identical outfit his father wore before/during his fall.  However the fact that his outfit is made of wool or cotton and Anakin's was made of leather totally changes the tone and presentation of the outfit.  For some reason to me the wool vest is softer and reflects better on his leaning towards the light.  Where Anakins leather vest is harsh and dark, and to me screams darksideHow is it incredible that they deliberately fashioned Anakin's outfit to mirror Luke's? I'm sure they did, as they did lots of that stuff through the prequels. They really should not have been trying to 'make things rhyme' as much as they did, but they did.Moreso than just the similarities, I think he was emphasizing that the minor differences in the costuming had a big impact on his visual impression of the character."
"Edit: Grammar.It's like poetry, so that they rhyme.Film sets looked a lot cooler pre cgi. We get some awesome effects now but there is something magical about all that awesome modeling and make up work. Bring back puppets, too. CGI Yoda is not the same.CGI Yoda was great. Sure, I liked the old puppet Yoda, but CGI Yoda was so well done that at times I had to remind myself that he wasn't real. Short of finding a creature who looks exactly like Yoda, I don't think they could have done a better job. His facial expressions were a shitload more convincing than the puppet.Also, he wouldn't've been able to do those awesome fight sequences as a puppet.  I know some fans dislike Yoda being so action-y in the prequels, but in my opinion it really helps show why he was seen as such a great master, and gives his transition into living as a hermit more impact.To me it just seems forced and weird when he has that lightsaber battle. I particularly remember his somersault jumps just looking completely stupid."
"Watching the prequels, you don't really get a sense that he was a great master at all IMO. He spends most of the movies sat in that dumb chair and running away from stuff. His one big fight comes off as really out of character and strange. All the reasons why he's a great master are conveyed in ESB. The CGI video game in the prequel does nothing but shit all over thisBut the fight scene also kills an aspect of his character - he was a great Jedi Master because of his wisdom, not his sword swinging. It pushes the whole idea of the order towards combat, and further from the ideas of self knowledge, inner peace, and wisdom.Indeed.  We don't want to see the master who famously said Wars not make one great hopping around like a crazy crackhouse rat.  Thats what is weird about going from the prequels to the original trilogy. You can shit on the prequels all day long, but Yoda was done well. He actually was a physically capable and coherent being. You can't say the same for the OT. He appears crippled and insane.I actaully agree, the CGI yoda looks more convincing than puppet yoda, although it's pretty obvious that both are fake. The character of Yoda is infinitely more real and more insteresting in the Original Trilogy, though. He actually has a personality and some interesting dialogue."
"In the prequels he's kind of a bullshit, nothingy character who says and does nothing of interest other than a big choreographed lightsaber battle, and sitting around on a big chair a lot and looking wise.Look at farscape, they couldn't afford cgi and as a result it has some of the best puppet work I have ever seen, Original Trilogy Yoda on the other hand...Maybe I'm misinterpreting your statement but are you implying that OT Yoda was poor puppetry? ESB Yoda was pretty mind-blowing at the time.Original Trilogy Yoda will always look and feel far more alive to me than CGI Yoda.http://boards.theforce.net/threads/practical-effects-in-the-prequels-sets-pictures-models-etc.50017310/Behind the scenes is mostly now dude(s) sitting at a computer, woo hoo.It's not like he clicks his fingers and it appears on the computer like magic. It takes hard work.It still feels hollow. Nobody's saying that, I think they were just lamenting that it's less visually interesting.  Be that as it may, many people don't appreciate the hard work that goes into this kind of stuff. They see it as a cop-out, which is doing the artists a disservice in my opinion.It's much cheaper and less less hard work than doing it physically and by hand though, and the results aren't as good.holy fuck. I want to tie people who create comments like these to a chair and force them to mask out a 10 second video clip in Nuke (not even AfterEffect) to see how much hard work goes into CGI."
"Holyshit people, you guys sure are ignorant. I'm not saying it's not hard work. I'm saying that it's cheaper and easier than making a model by hand and filming it, and gives less visually appealing results.If anything, it IS faster because the artists and sculptors and create prototype models rapidly using Mudbox, Zbrush and a 3d printers. Its a tool to the trade, and notice that CG is still in its infantile stage in terms of movie making. Good CG, in good directing hands, is much, much visually appealing than physical model. Look at gravity for example, it has so much CG in it, but its so good you don't even notice it"
"What I'm saying is that don't ever assume that CG is easy work. It might be comparatively easier compared to physical stage and models, but its similar to saying how chopping down a tree using an Axe is better than using a chainsaw to cut down the same tree."
"Its just different tools for the artist (or timberman) to utilize for his craft. And its just that. > Good CG, in good directing hands, is much, much visually appealing than physical model."
"Disagree. Nothing comes close to those grand sweeping shots of the star destroyers and death star in the Original Trilogy, or the grand space station in 2001 and the EVA pod, or the ships in Alien and Aliens."
"You simply don't get the same sense of scale and reality with CG as you do with a model. Yeah it has that initial visual wow factor, but ultimately, well-done practical models always look better imo."
">What I'm saying is that don't ever assume that CG is easy work."
"I haven't at any stage."
">It might be comparatively easier compared to physical stage and models"
"It is, there is no might about it."
">chopping down a tree using an Axe is better than using a chainsaw to cut down the same tree."
"Quite. With an axe you get total control over where and how the tree falls. With a chainsaw you get the job done a lot faster, and it's still hard work to chainsaw down a tree, but the results aren't as good as if you used a hand axe."
">Its just different tools for the artist (or timberman) to utilize for his craft. And its just that."
"Exactly. And one set of tools gives better results than another. One set of tools is faster, more efficient and more cost effective, where the other set of tools produces the best quality artwork, but is more expensive and slower.>It's much cheaper"
"Nope."
">less less hard work than doing it physically"
"Nope."
"You need to see Life After Pi."
"CGI's strength is that the process is iterative by nature. The power of CGI is that I can show a 25% done super-massive explosion to the director or supervisors and get their feedback; that cannot practically be done with practical fx. That is the exact reason why CGI is so standard; it gives the directors more control to get the shot that they want.Yes it is cheaper and easier than practical effects done well."
"I've seen it.>Yes it is cheaper"
"Again, wrong."
">easier than practical effects done well"
"Again, wrong.I'd like some sources from one or both of you. Goddamnit, who do I upvote!?Being the person you originally replied to, I do have an appreciation of what goes into special effects, and I even think it can be presented in an interesting way; just like behind the scenes for films like Avatar and people like Pixar"
"My last comment was mostly a joke and wasn't intended to degrade how cool computer-based work is."
"Edit: also Star Wars in particular was ruined by Lucas abusing special effects and taking it too farWhat parts do you think were ruined? On various message boards I've read stuff written by people who seriously think that the prequels should have been made with exactly the same techniques used in the old movies. I wouldn't go as far as those people, and I guess the prequels weren't ruined *by* the special effects, they were just overdone."
"The movies themselves are bad first and foremost because the plot is awful and hollow and leeches heavily off of the originality of the original sequels. But secondly because CG were used unnecessarily often and were overdone in the sense that the screen is just a clusterfuck of explosions and clones and robots and lasers."
"I highly recommend checking out Red Letter Media's prequel reviews which are very long and kind of strange, but very comprehensive and (mostly) objectiveI didn't mind the prequels at all. That isn't to say that there's nothing I'd change about them, but there's plenty of stuff I'd change about the old movies, too.It's a cop out for the director and production company, because it's easier for them to farm that shit out to VFX guys. However hard those VFX guys might work on it, the audience still gets the shaft and ends up with a more disposable product that has less character, charm and doesn't stand the test of time. I've had plenty of experiences where I was talking to my VFX supe/on-site art director about a shot I was working on. We got it to place where we liked it in terms of roughly presenting what the shot is, so we sent it to the production studio who sends it to the director. No complaints. We send an update weekly, which is where the studio reviews. 3 weeks go by with no major complaints during client reviews, but then I get released the message that the director wasn't happy with the shot at all and made some huge specific changes...changes would would have been a hell of a lot easier to do when I was 10 versions ago. That happens just about every project. It's like clockwork."
"Directors and production companies do use us as a crutch because it's easier for them to forget about us (your general no detail 'Looks good' in reviews), and then go ballistic and have us scrap and redo weeks of work. Most directors aren't really interested in the first iterations and don't leverage that bonus and don't get involved early.As an artist, thank you.You can appreciate the hard work and not really care for the final result.  And sometimes people demand appreciation simply because they put a lot of hard work into something, but it doesn't really work that way.don't you think those solid colored suits with the balls all over them and green screens are *magical*?It's not about one or the other, it's about using both appropriately.  People always forget this.  Perfect example was the cockpit from Pacific Rim.  A lot of it was built and functional, but parts that couldn't be done traditionally and/or would look better as CGI were done so.This is why I get so excited seeing pictures from the Episode VII sets.I remember Kevin Smith talking about how he wept after visiting the set. Being able to actually go into the Millennium Falcon gave him faith that J.J was going to do it right. Kevin smith cries over everything. He fucking cried looking at the new batman costume. Did it have nipples?It really seems like some high quality work too that payed off. The space combat scenes in the third movie are probably still my favorite space combat situations out there. The laser and explosion effects may be somewhat meh but other than that it looked superb (the last time I watched it anyways)."
"Seeing the models for the Death Star is kinda awe inspiring. That sequence too is just top notch."
"edit:"
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZigWFyK2o Yeh, it's still great. Whoever directed those sequences did a fantastic job. They really conveyed the scope of the battle quite well."
"All the light-sources (such as the thrusters) that had to be added in post sadly really stand out but it's not that bothersome in the end if direction and sound design do their part fantastic too.Thing that always got me about that sequence:"
"Admiral Ackbar: Prepare to jump into hyperspace on my mark"
"Lando: Alright, standby"
"And they immediately all jump to hyperspace... I just imagine Ackbar sitting there thinking Those fuckups did it to me *again!*"
"Real sets tend to age better than CGI effects (assuming the real sets are done well). You also have this gritty lived-in feel that was mostly absent from the prequel movies. That's not a failure of CGI in general, that's a failure of the prequels specifically.No, the same thing applies to the Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit movies. Debatable, I thought some of the effects in LoTR were great. It's not the best example of gritty CGI but it's closer to good than the prequels.The Lord of the Rings used CGI very effectively and generally only when needed. It's actually one of the best examples you could name that mixed real sets with CGI. The Hobbit movies on the other hand...I disagree, LOTR the effects hold up extremely well...and anyways they used a bunch of practical effects along with CGI."

"You could argue that Golum sorta shows his age but I still think his looks pretty damn good. http://geekoutlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Golum.jpg"
"But the original Un-edited starwars were certainly showing their age...Some of the practical effect were looking pretty old. Not that I support the revamping of the originals, minor touchups were okay in my book but their were too many drastic changes."

"Of cource their were some damn good effects.I should have worded that better, I agree that the effects in the Lord of the Rings hold up amazing due to the mix of practical effects and CGI. I was trying to say that a lot of the reasons why the original Star Wars trilogy are better than the prequels also apply to why LotR is better than the Hobbit. Whaaa? You're lumping in the Lord of the Rings trilogy with the Hobbit for CGI that doesn't hold up well!? I understand The Hobbit, because that was just terrible, but LotR, Fellowship especially, use so little CGI. Those movies were so good because it felt like Middle Earth was a real place.The set design in those movies is incredible. Peter Jackson used tons of real sets. True, but the CGI sets he used look like shit.I would disagree.  Do you have any specific examples of poor CGI sets?He made gradual moves toward CGI as the LoTR movies went on. You can't definitely notice the change with each film. TT had a good balance of real and CGI and probably stands out as a great example of how to integrate CGI with the rest of a film. RoTK is the first instance of Jackson going overboard and all his films have suffered since."
"The CGI is absolutely appalling in The Hobbit films. It blows my mind that the Academy awards thought that the first film was deserving of a nomination for production design and visual effects awards.I'm with you on the Hobbit films, I think the CGI in those movies is so overblown and silly looking.Minas Tirith was a real set, the Fields of Pelennor was a location, the Black Gate was a location, Mount Doom was a location, the Houses of Healing was a set, Rivendell was a set, the stairs at Minas Morgul was a set, Shelob's Lair was a set, etc."
"I'm struggling to think of any CGI sets in Return of the King.  Sure, there were mattes added behind a lot of the sets but which sets were fully CGI like Star Wars I-III?"
"As far as The Hobbit goes the CGI was great.  Gollum was fantastic, the orcs looked good, Smaug looked incredible.  There are just a few instances where Jackson tries to push the boundaries and it crosses the threshold of believability.  Namely the barrel chase sequence, simply because of how he portrays the agility of elves, and the sequence involving a particularly portly dwarf.> As far as The Hobbit goes the CGI was great."
"lol watThe Orcs looked like total crap compared to the ones in LOTR trilogy. [Bolg](http://i.imgur.com/HHPjp6A.jpg) is a good example on how they completely ruined good designs with shitty CGI. They had the guy in mask act the scenes and then put shitty CGI orc on top of him, despite the fact that he looked 10 times better and more realistic. The design is perfectly subjective and has nothing to do with the quality of CGI or costumes."
"I like the design on the left better.The left looks fake, the right one looks realistic. Bad CGI looks like it is fake.FYI"
"http://boards.theforce.net/threads/practical-effects-in-the-prequels-sets-pictures-models-etc.50017310/There is an elegance to models and sets that CGI simply can't recreate 100%. Perhaps it is the way the light reflects off of solid objects, or perhaps it is the physics of movement that CGI still can't replicate 100%, but whatever it is I find myself always being disappointed when watching movies with a lot of CGI."
"When I watch a director like Nolan who limits CGI I am always so impressed with how much  more I am drawn into the world he is creating. I know I am more sensitive to CGI than most people, maybe it's because I have been playing PC video games for 35+ years so I have seen computer physics grow and develop, so I can spot CGI a mile away."
"I envy people who can go to a movie with CGI and just walk out and say wow I couldn't even tell it was CGI. That's what bothered me about the prequel, Everything was smooth, tech wise things looked more advanced than the original. Yeah like every movie doesn't have to be blade runner gritty but those CGI sets were ridiculously clean looking that made them look unrealWatch Attack of the Clones again (on mute if you want). It's shocking how poorly its aged in only 12 years.Damn you're right. [This scene looks awefull](http://youtu.be/h9h0V_BQ34U?t=1m32s)"
"But Return of the Jedi?  Some of the space battle shots are amazing.  They have amazing composure, and while there's a lot going on, you can still get a sense of what's happening with everything on the screen...  That opening scene in Revenge of the Sith is just visual overload."
"The scenes in the beginning were designed that way. Lucas wanted to show that this war was truely terrible, and abosoloutely huge in every way we can imagine. I think that having hundreds of ships fight over a planet full of tens of billions of people was a perfect way to do so.  The fact that the old movies had a few ships at best was because 1, no CGI to do so, and 2, even with cgi avaible, I don't think Lucas would have done it like ROTS because the scale wasn't there. There wasn't millions of Clone Troopers and Droids out across the galaxy fighting a war, there was thousands of rebels against thousands of the Empires troops. Nothing remotely compareable to the Clone Wars. Lucas didn't car if you actually noticed what was going on in the backround, it was there to show you that this is a part of the biggest god damned battle the Republic had ever needed to win for thousands of years, and they had to do it with every ship they had. I'm not sure if I'm making sense... But I tried.It was pretty shocking at the time.Now watch the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, which was released around the same time. All of the CGI absolutely holds up to todays standards, and the sets are all brilliantly done. Goes to show that Practical sets and CGI can mix well if done right.That's one of the reasons I'm so disappointed with the Hobbit movies, the CGI is done with a completely different approach than the LOTR moviesI feel the same way. Supposedly they originally did the orcs with make up, but the 48 FPS made it look fake, so they had to redo it with CGI. That doesn't make me feel better about it though. I can live with that though. What I don't like are the silly additions to the story, particularly the Tauriel/Kili plot line..its just ridiculous, and Kili's dialogue when she's healing him on the table was just atrocious. Well, not *all* of it. Legolas suddenly turning into a cartoon while fighting in Moria comes to mind. That part looked bad even at the time.And the battles in RotK look pretty bad now.  Lord of the Rings CGI hasn't aged very well in my opinion, but they used so many sets, miniatures, and bigatures that it mostly still holds up.I was watching Blade Runner the other day, and good God does it still look amazing. I think CGI has a place, but I don't think you can beat old fashioned sets and models for most things. Watching Farscape again recently, I've really started to appreciate the lived-in, Jim Henson workshop feel of ROTJ and genuinely genuinely hope the next three movies will maintain that aspect. Comparing that screen test picture of Luke with the simple cloak to the comparatively orate robes of obi wan and Mace Windu (while it makes sense) makes me hope there is something lost from the purge and Civil War that will never be regained, a sort of glory to the Old Republic that is lost and the likes of which we will never see in the sequels. I think that will drive home the devastation of the wars and maybe- maybe- make me appreciate the prequels more.*Does* it make sense? I always thought that Luke and Obi Wan dressed the way they did because they were were from Tatooine and that's just how moisture farmers and desert hermits dressed."
"It never made any sense to me why in the prequels [Qui Gon Jinn and Obi Wan](http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/24600000/thingy-qui-gon-jinn-and-obi-wan-kenobi-24604327-1024-768.jpg) and other Jedis dressed this way too.Ben and Yoda have much of the same garb in the classic films as they did in the prequels. Just kinda ragged."
"What I meant to say though, was if the prequels were the *belle epoque* then the OT and ST should be the Great DepressionIt doesn't make any sense. [Uncle Owen is dressed this way too.](http://goodbadaverage.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/uncle-owen.jpg) So is the [bartender](http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6096/6996840767_5981c7aa17_z.jpg)."
"The prequels are an abortion. There was no reason to make all the [other Jedi in the prequels](http://themovieblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Mace-Windu-star-wars-characters-3339991-1425-1227.jpg) dress like Tatooine moisture farmers. It's dumb and it was a mistake.I disagree. It makes sense to me from a design standpoint. Jedi are warrior monks, the longer flowing robes make them look elegant and peaceful, the shorter garments beneath are perfect for lightsaber combat. Or every storm/clonetrooper CGI. > The prequels are an abortion."
"No... they actually got to live. We only *wish* they were an abortion.No, the Prequels were actually pretty good, and at points were better than the OT, and I prefer the prequels over the OT as a matter of fact. I sense a dark disturbance in the force...Don't downvote him because you don't agree. He's obviously confused and misled, but that's no reason to downvote. If you like, I can point you to a series of videos that explain in detail *why* the prequels are bad, and these videos are far more entertaining than said prequels. You may already know the videos of which I speak.Show me a video which tells me in detail and I can agree makes good points as  to how the OT was better than the PT. i had no idea about all the painted backgrounds n stuffYou'll love this video."

"You're goddamn right, Carrie.People have been shitting on this movie for 30 years, but this movie is Star Wars for me. It's not the best film of the series, sure, but I was 6 when it came out in theaters, and a year or so later it was the only film of the trilogy we owned on VHS, and I wore that motherfucker down to the nub. No amount of tracking was gonna fix it."
"To 7 year old me, there was no one more heroic in my eyes than Luke Skywalker. The badass way he stood up to Jabba. The whole sail barge sequence. His self-sacrifice attitude in leaving his friends and confronting the Emperor solo. His belief that there was still good in his father, a feeling that I would come to echo in my own adult life towards my estranged Dad. Luke was my role model growing up, and it was thanks to this movie."
"Fuck anyone out there who thinks this movie is just a bunch of muppets. I love this film, and I'll ride for it til the day I die. In the 14th picture, I can't figure out what temperature it is outside.  There are dudes without shirts or wearing shorts, and there's two guys wearing sweatshirts."
"And can someone explain to me what Blue Harvest is on picture 36?Blue Harvest was the working of 'Return of the Jedi'."
"> When shooting Jedi in the United States we called the film Blue Harvest. Camera slates, invoices, hotel reservations, call sheets, production reports, and crew hats and T-shirts all read Blue Harvest. So when a visitor would ask, 'what are you shooting' and we said Blue Harvest, they went on their way. Can you imagine what would have happened if we had said, 'We're shooting the next film in the Star Wars trilogy'?"

Blue Harvest was the [working title](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_title) while filming to prevent prying eyes."
"[From Wookieepedia](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_VI:_Return_of_the_Jedi):"
"> For several reasons, the working title of the project was Blue Harvest and dubbed Horror Beyond Imagination to engender no interest whatsoever in order to disguise what the production crew was really filming from fans and the prying eyes of the press. George Lucas had severed all his remaining ties to the Hollywood system out of a feeling of persecution after the success of The Empire Strikes Back and had become a truly independent filmmaker. Lucasfilm is a non-union company, and despite George Lucas's stature and clout, that, says Howard Kazanjian in Empire of Dreams, made acquiring shooting locations more difficult and more expensive, even though A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back were mammoth hits."
"> The title was used in all areas where it seemed necessary. The Blue Harvest ruse, credited to producer Howard Kazanjian, was very thorough, emblazoning the fictitious film's logo on a wide range of film production items including shirts, caps, coats, buttons, signs, invoices and stationery. The Blue Harvest facade did give a bit of a wink and nod to its true purpose however, as the supposed film's logo (intentionally or unintentionally) utilized the distinctive Star Wars logo lettering style. In particular the ruse was employed during location filming in Yuma, Arizona. The filming took place in the dunes over the Thanksgiving holiday, where there was a reported crowd of 35,000 dune buggy enthusiasts. After erecting a chain link fence, employing a huge security force, and dodging a myriad of press inquiries, in the end approximately sixty fans saw through the ruse and refused to leave until they obtained a few autographs and photos.>in the end approximately sixty fans saw through the ruse and refused to leave until they obtained a few autographs and photos."
"Just goes to how how different the world is today. You could have 60 people find out something and it would still remain a secret to most."
"These days the photos would be on twitter and worldwide within seconds, and everyone in the world would know the exact location and nature of the shoot within hours."
"I mean we've kind of already seen it with episode VII filming, some random shots surfaced from someone doing a flypast in a plane and all of a sudden the whole world has seen them.What is this, a Death Star for ANTS?![#44](http://i.imgur.com/U1lkdmb.jpg)"
"Damn, that's awesome.We used to build things in this country. You can do wonders with CGI but matte paintings and miniatures just seem more magical and skillful to me.I agree, but that is no reason to compromise a work where CGI would have worked better. Matte paintings are really really cool, but I wouldn't say they're more skillful. They do require a ton of skill, but the things they do with modern CGI today is absolutely insane and beyond anything they could have dreamed of back then."
"[Look at the insane detail that they put into those CGI characters.](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KbGVmL8uidk/Uh7yeK5oWKI/AAAAAAAASK8/uEpOunGq9ns/s1600/Azogollgob.jpg)I actually thought most of the CG in that movie looked fake.  Especially Azog.  When you got a shot of him standing next to an actor in practical make-up, it became even more obvious he was fake.I felt the same. Except for Gollum. Holy shit. He looked incredible.I agree.  Gollum looked great.  He looked great in the original films, too, so I guess they would have had to work pretty hard to screw that one up.Just think about all of those midgets employed.You think George Lucas paid them under the table?Hopefully he didn't try to short them. What I would like to learn when I see these photo series is who does the entire planning of such a project? Looking at the Batman photos etc I can't see how Nolan, Lucas or any director can keep focus unless somebody else is doing an amazing job at actually planning, ordering and scheduling stuff down to a very detailed level and picking the right people for various project management roles."
"I work as a tiny cog on gigantic oil rig project and I often wonder who the hell managed to split such a gigantic project into a manageable task."
">who does the entire planning of such a project?"
"Production designer, production manager and assistant director are job titles of the folks that generally do this but I suspect Lucas did a lot of that stuff too."
"Big budget films actually get away with a lot less staff these days. ROTJ had a huge crew & cast."
"Funny thing. I've actually worked in an oil refinery and on a film crew so it's interesting to make that comparison. The big difference would be shit gets done a lot faster on the film set.

"[http://i.imgur.com/SEbAW2v.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/SEbAW2v.jpg)This makes it seem like movies were much more fun back in the day to film.

Turns out the average person has no clue about special and visual effects. I work in VFX, you'd be so surprised what makes it to print that people would assume is real that is fake, and stuff people think is CG/matte painting because it's too clean actually is an exquisitely crafted model, etc. A proper production needing effects blends the line seamlessly. there were apparently a lot of practical effects used in 1-3, but the simple fact that they didn't make a SINGLE suit of clone trooper armor pisses me off so much.I remember seeing a making of and I didn't realize that in episode 1 the Naboo palace for Amidala was a model. They used salt for the waterfalls. There was still a lot of CGI but at least there was some basis in physical reality.yeah there were still practical sets in the Prequels (far more so in I than II or III), but the majority of it all was rendered in a computer (including the actors delivering their lines!).So In those scenes with all the stormtroopers greeting the emperor it was special effects??it was a large painting with some actual people in the foregroundYeah the first 2 layers of Stormtroopers facing the emperor when he arrives are real, the ones behind them are painted."

"Thought it was interesting seeing how involved on set Lucas was despite not directing. I have a People magazine around somewhere from 1982, it has an article about the filming of this movie when it was still called Revenge of the Jedi, lots of behind the scenes pics on Endor sets. It's funny, the article speculates about the other Yoda mentions at the end of Empire, thinking it may be Han or Boba Fett.Always wondered this - during the filming of the original trilogy - when darth Vader was walking around and carrying on dialect - was the actor who played Vader actually speaking at all? I know James Earl Jones was the voice of Vader - I'm sure that was dubbed after...but I have always wondered if the actor spoke."
"Edit - sorry for the James Earl Jones / James Earl Ray mix up! My bad!I read somewhere that he did to help other actors in acting. As a matter of fact he was pissed off 2 times. First when he went to see the first Star Wars and realized they dubbed his voice in post-production (yeah, that happened). And second when he went to see ESB and found out that his character didn't say the lines he said on set (Obi-Wan is your father). It's a very interesting backstory. Bonus: the guy in the Vader costume without the helmet was another guy than the 'regular' Vader."
"Yes I know I should get and friends and a life and such.. ;)I always find it funny that Vader, in the 6 actual movies, was played by 5 separate actors.Harrison as Han Solo just looks so effortlessly cool, like the James Dean of sci-fi without the death. Also, when I'm not at work I'm totally checking out that 1,138 bts album you made.It looks like that guy is fucking Ackbar.This is awesomeThanks for sharing thisI like photo number 6. It is of [Buboicullaar](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Buboicullaar), he has quite an interesting backstory."
"He looks stupid, but is very intelligent, and he uses that to his advantage. He was originally sent to kill Jabba, but betrayed his original master to work for Jabba. After Jabba dies he goes on to become a monk with the B'omarr Monks, and ends up being enlightened enough to no longer need a body, the monks then remove his brain and moves it to a robot."
"The stories about the [B'omarr Monks](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/B%27omarr_Order) is a great read as well. They originally built Jabbas Palace for themselves, and then Jabba arrived and started rebuilding parts of it to fit his needs.I think I may have to turn all of these into giant canvas prints and then start acquiring property so I have somewhere to hang it all. That is so amazing! Thanks for your effort and putting these togetherIs that Messi painting the 3rd picture?The most upworthy post I've ever seen on RedditCarrie Fisher was such a hottie back then. Daaaayyuuuuum.Holy shit this is one of the coolest things I've seen on reddit."
"I didn't know they used conventional (?) effects so much more than cgi. They were practically living in Star Wars during the shoot. No wonder people complain about cgi nowadays."

"http://i.imgur.com/PDp3UoN.jpg50 pictures went by so fast. I had to count them because i didn't think it was fifty, but it was.This is just an observation, and maybe someone can offer a more nuanced view:"
"The Death Star (#2) looks small like that.  When it's dissected, it looks like you can see the individual sized floors that humanoid-creatures would be walking around on.  There appear to be about 50 floors in the upper-hemisphere, so that makes ~100 floors total.  A large skyscraper, for sure, but nowhere near the size of a moon.  If a spaceship were to fly through the center of that, it'd be maybe the length of like 10 or 12 city blocks - it's go straight thru it in like a few seconds flat."
"I guess what I'm saying is: if we're to believe that this thing is as big as they're saying what it is, those individual floors that are visible CAN'T be individual floors - there must be like lots of individual floors in all those visible levels."
"Then again, now that Im thinking about it, the hangars in these buildings had pretty high ceilings, so I could be way off here.  If you consider that the middle band section is supposed to be the height of a hanger that ships fly out of (and those ships were huge) that should provide some insight into the scale of the Death Star.That picture actually shows the true massive scale of the Death Star.  Those 'floors' are actually part of the outer superstructure, upon which the outer hull would be attached.  There would be dozens of levels in between those sections."
"As a note on scale, that centre trench line houses all the hangar bays, ans some of those hangar bays can hold Star Destroyers, and that is a tiny fraction of the Death Star.My guess is the large striations are meant to be superstructure levels.  In-between each is meant to be a lot of smaller levels, each of which are human-sized (or inserted compartments of levels of various sizes.)  If I recall you see some of this when the Millennium Falcon is pulled into the first Death star (I can't find the original image from the film, but [here is the concept art](http://33.media.tumblr.com/3470c1be2b56bf4a39441fcae80ef8b1/tumblr_nbloyoM3SU1s2wio8o7_1280.jpg)).  There are large bands of structure, beween which are actually many ship hangers, each of which has maybe four or five human-sized levels."
"So between each of those bands you see on the model, you could easily fit one and possibly two skyscrapers."
"Doing the math: Let's say each of the large bands is 1000 meters (slightly larger than the current tallest skyscraper).  If there are 200 levels, it means the moon is 200 km in diameter -- not huge, but certainly the size of a small moon.  I'm sure canon already has a definitive answer for this.I think it's more likely just a case of [Sci-Fi writers have no sense of scale.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScifiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale)according to the incredible cross-sections books, much of the Death Star is power generation and weapons systemsTop phrase from the making of Jedi: Leia can grab my light saber.Pretty sure this post would get even more upvotes if it was"
"*50 photos of Slave Leia from RETURN OF THE JEDI*I want to say that the scale of the death star just doesn't really match up to the size of a small moon when you can see the individual levels inside of it."
"But then again, the Death Star is famous for having chasms and unprotected walkways that lead hundreds of meters below so maybe it matches up."
"You can see that the center trench which is barely big enough for a fighter to fit in is much smaller than a 'floor' in the unfinished death star.JD and Turk?"
"http://i.imgur.com/7jRiXud.jpgI just clicked to see Carrie FisherI'm a Star Wars fan, but I got to ask real Star Wars fans: Did the Ewoks completely ruin this movie? It completely ruined it for me.

I was born in 1981 so it did not ruin the movie for me. I still have fond memories and do like Ewoks but it is illogical and silly that they can can effectively fight any mechanized army."

"When Star Wars hit in summer of 77 nobody had seen anything like it since the 1930s with Flash Gordon. In the 70s the US was stuck in its Vietnam war hangover and nobody was making *fun* movies.

"*Everyone was really small*I love this. Thank you The first picture shows some guy painting the scene where many stormtroopers are marching in the hanger of the deathstar. Presumably they paint each frame one by one, and I guess this is the original way in which animation films were made."
"However, I have always wondered if they use some trick or special technique to make each of the frames similar to each other, for example in the first picture in this album with stormtroopers, how did they get each stormtrooper in just the right position in each frame?"
"I imagine it being really hard, and mistakes would be made and that they would be glaringly obvious in the finished product - but I never really have noticed any obvious mistakes."
"Are/were the artists just really that good to get each frame just so, or did they have particular techniques for this???????surprised to see that nieb nung is a puppet rather than someone in a maskI did not realize they made the entire shuttle (minus the wings) at full scale.Picture #2 - What's on George's wrist?Link to image [#2](http://i.imgur.com/BskmC12.jpg)."

"http://boards.theforce.net/threads/practical-effects-in-the-prequels-sets-pictures-models-etc.50017310/See above posts. Plenty of miniatures in the prequels and in many films today still. They prefer the term little people.If they had made the prequels the same way as the old films Lucas would have been genius..(minus the bad writing and acting of course). Something to be said about the old style of puppeteers and models in old movies that is lost with CGI. CGI is more efficient and cost effective but still the magic is just not there. CGI also look so horribly fake compared to the object actually being there. Even the spaceships look better as models.One photo chronicling the making of 'Revenge of the Sith': http://i.imgur.com/f7aIZYX.jpgSo, were all these practical effects and real built sets cheaper than CGI?  Good question. I'm really not sure what the costs difference is. However, the prequel trilogy didn't use as much CGI as people think."

"The original versions have been released on every home video format except for blu-ray. They are readily available for anyone to enjoy. In 1988, home video was beginning to take off.

Why would an entire population (species?) all look totally identical? That movie was a disgrace to the original Tim Burton's decision to duplicate Deep Roy is half the reason that movie sucks."

Usually people shit all over it in /r/movies and I can never quite figure out why. FUCK OOMPA LOOMPAS MAN. My childhood nightmare were those fuckers. The new ones are not scary tho which is niceI thought I was the only one! For real, I couldn't watch the original when I was growing up. That movie terrified me.Those things were ridiculous!!! Everyone always laughs when I tell them but it's not a gameJust keep some Vermicious Knids around as pets budOr possibly a wangdoodle!SCRAMWas I the only one who tripped balls when I read that book?Up until recently I always thought the Oompa Loompa was the driver from How I Met Your Mother. Fuck that shit. Tour de Force performances in Star Trek and Into Darkness."
"Wonder if he'll follow JJ back to Star Wars, though.I hope so.Git doon!*An* Oompa Loompa? He literally played every single one.God, that movie sucked.You can certainly find much worse Depp/Burton movies (ahem Alice)."
"I largely prefer the original but it's not horrible.Yeah but just because it's not his worse, doesn't make it automatically good I know which is why I added it was not horrible. I was even being a bit strong, it's a decent flick. Opinions may vary of course.Alice is up there with his planet of the apes that's for sure. If any movie didn't need a remake it was wily wanka though.Oh, I forgot about Planet of the apes... thanks a lot buddy...Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is not a remake of Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.  /wrist Which is where a lot of the undue hate comes from, it's not a remake, it's an adaption (a more faithful adaption at that) of the same source material.Technically, he was a singular oompa loompa many times in a row."
"But getting that technical is just douchey.I think pointing out that he played every single one is the key point.  If you research WHY he got $1million, it is because the actors union stated that each oompa loompa was a different role.do you want to get technical? because you're wrong"
"he played many different oompa loompas in that movie. what you said is like watching From Dusk Til Dawn and claiming Cheech played the same singular greasy mexican three times in a rowRespect is due where respect is due, regardless.How the fuck does that deserve respect?

Every Oompla Looma was different. He is on record as saying he did this deliberately. In group shots, he made sure each member moved slightly individually. So he played every oompa loompa, although one at a time.Here's an example of what you're saying. You can clearly see in [this picture](http://www.imdb.com/media/rm54431488/nm0746989?ref_=nmmd_md_nxt) that he has a different expression and slightly different pose for every single Oompa. Haters gonna hate. Oompas gonna Loompa.I look at it like eddie murphy in nutty prof dinner scene. Each reshoot is a completely new character and job of its own.So what you're saying is that he wasn't playing all the oompa loompas simultaneously?Yes. And also no.

"At the age of 50 he married a 16 yr old girl. Creepy indeed.Ugh.  I haven't watched X Files in years and that dude still haunts my dreams.The theme song alone always creeped me out. I'm sort of glad I don't know what episode you guys are talking about. Aaahh, it's 2 am and I should NOT be thinking about The X-Files right now. Just think about the episode Home. That'll make you feel better.Tooms was absolutely creepy, and his episodes are two of my favorites."

"I imagine since he was used only for a couple scenes where they needed Yoda to be completely self-contained, they probably classified it the same way they do when a regular actor uses a body double. Really, for the majority of the movie and for *all* the voice acting Yoda was played by Frank Oz. George Lucas. That's how.Remember, when anything wrong ever happens in the world, blame George Lucas.I'm just going to leave this here."

I don't know for sure but I'm thinking Charlie and the chocolate factory has gone down at least a bit.Just checked, it only dipped one percent. I was surprised, I thought the reaction was more mixed. I like both films quite a bit though, and I remember that being the last Tim Burton film I really enjoyed.He was also in the (original) Doctor Who episode/serial The Talons of Weng-Chiang as a ventriloquist dummy that killed people.The Peking Humonculus. In The Lively Arts: Whose Doctor Who they have footage of this rehearsal, Deep's disinterestedly watching Tom Baker gad about. And he's wearing a huge wing collar, looks like he's about ready to fly off.This is what I remember him from! He stood out in the credits because his name is Deep Roy. The Talons of Weng-Chiang is one of my favorite Doctor Who stories, though I've only seen that story and maybe a few others from the Tom Baker years. I don't know what the rest of Doctor Who is like, but the fourth doctor episodes will always hold a special place in my heart for their weirdness.> I don't know what the rest of Doctor Who is like"

"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdwtZpg-rF0"
"The Peking Homunculus (Mr. Sin) is a cyborg with the cerebellum of a pig. It has been smuggled back in time to Victorian England. The knife-throwing woman is Leela, who is a warrior tribeswoman from the far-future. She is usually wearing a loincloth, but is dressed up for much of this episode so that she won't frighten people. (I seem to recall that the dress gets torn off at some point)."
"Sadly this serial has a bit of historical baggage. It's a bit hamfisted with ethnic stereotypes regarding Chinese immigrants in London. Tight script and beatiful production if you can put that in context."
"The stereotypes aren't too bad, it's the fact that they got a white actor in makeup to play a chinese man is a bit more bothersomeYup. It's sorta on the cusp of when it became not OK to do that. If it had been a few years later, nobody would have signed off on it. If it had been a few years earlier, they would have been forgiven because that was the way things were back then.Tv shows from the 70s are quite brutal with racial and ethnic humor, not to mention the gay jokes and jokes at the expense of people of certain religions. I I can laugh at that kinda stuff but part of me is always a bit shocked by how casually it was thrown around on tv.I said it on the elephant/Bantha album and I'll say it here:  Disney, if this is some kind of slick marketing ploy, I'm not even mad -- just keep the new behind-the-scenes photos coming from the original trilogy.I remember that comment.[deleted]We aren't forgetting, don't worry.Wait there's a new star wars?I still can't get over that him and Kiran Shah are both Indian actors born in Nairobi Kenya about a year apart and less than 2 inches deference in size. And are in no way related and careers are totally independent.  Are they totally independent? I see Kiran Shah is also credited with work on Return of the Jedi and The Dark Crystal."
"I was working as a server in Southern California,  at a fancy steakhouse right across from Marvel studios. (Manhattan Beach area) And I had the pleasure of waiting on this Deep Roy! His humble party of three were celebrating something. Such a nice guy, and his friends really  admired him. Deep Roy and his friends drank our top shelf scotch at like $30 a glass. And I'm not shitting you, he drank like 8 of them. He still acted like a gentleman drunk, just a slower speaking one! I wish I knew at the time he was in Star Wars, so I could of told him. I could of told him how much better Star Trek is then Star Wars... ;) ... Engage the down votes! True story tho. More I importantly, he was on The X-Files.On a side note, Deep Roy would make a great porn name.This dude was [terrifying](http://xfphotos.fredfarm.com/season8/8x10badlaa/badlaa012.jpg) in the X Files. is that mark hamill behind him in profile ? (green jacket, 1st photo)He's also fucking hilarious in East Bound and Down, like one of the funniest characters everDroppy McCool my favorite starwars character !!!! now i know who to idealizeTell ur bitch to stop sassing meI'll cut your fucking tits off![removed]He didn't get rich writing cheques!Knew a pathological liar who claimed over and over that Deep Roy was an uncle of his - the rest of his lies were much worse. I mainly remember Deep from The Neverending Story.He was the best in East Bound and Down. Season 2. He threatens to cut off some mexican dudes titty.Thought that was Joe Pesci.Racing snail! His face looks familiar. I'm pretty sure he was a random character in Flash Gordon too. A princesses' alien plaything, or somethingHe was  in Classic Dr Who story Talons of Weng ChiangI had a Halloween party last year he randomly showed up at, nice guy /mildlyinteresting Indian Yoda? Again, you will come.Willy Wonka is such an underrated film. Omg I know who that is! He was the Racing Snail jockey in the Never Ending Story! I have dreams about that guy all the way from childhood!Here is a link to an awesome short film starring Deep Roy that I just watched http://vimeo.com/35144846Deep Roy 4 Life, yo.Mother of God, he was the guy who rode the racing snail in Neverending Story."
"My childhood just jumped up and kicked me in the nards!Now I want to watch The X Files I partially unfairly blame him for ruining Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.The comedian Nathaniel Metcalf does an excellent routine about Deep Roy.He flirted with me at a con once, he's a pretty funny guy.Holy crap that last picture, i remember that from a Star Wars magazine that was released shortly after the remastered trilogy. That brings back some memories.Ewok like a man...He kinda looks like he's related to the [Belushi](http://images.wolfgangsvault.com/images/catalog/detail/RS368-RS.jpg) family in that 1st picWasnt he also the size double for Frodo?Dats DeepIt's not just any snail, its a RACING snail!Loved him in Eastbound and DownMy biggest concern is that there is a character in the original Star Wars trilogy named Droopy McCool.He also made a short movie [Ballad of Sandeep](http://vimeo.com/m/35144846) with my friend and former co-worker. Has a bit of an Office Space type of vibe and it got tons of awardsah, Droopy McCool, the legendary Jizz player. With the name Deep Roy I'd suggest he take a crack at the porn industry next.That's the dude that played the Indian willy wonka in never-ending story? NiceI wonder about Mr Roy quite a bit."
"The heavy costume roles I get. But what the hell possesed Burton to omniclone him into every Loompa and then dub such awful attempts at aping the original songs in?

Who came up with that brilliant name?You're a cold-hearted mother fucker Aaron.I was looking in the mirror today and i wished I had a potHis girlfriend gave him his name... under his robe - lookout!His best role was Aaron in eastbound and down ...spite of his overwhelming phobia of small bearshe's also (simon pegg pending) the only person to play a role in star trek, star wars AND dr who....This about star wars know I did notWhoa I never knew Roy was in Star Wars.  That dude's been around.He's old Roy not new.Technically he's Deep Roy.My dog eats Old Roy.Deep is a pretty badass nameIts true! I played a major role in Star Wars but wasn't given credit."
"Stop lying!"
"He was fkin awesome in season 2 of Eastbound and Down.>Indian Actor"
"He's Kenyan...Gurdeep Roy (born Mohinder Purba; 1 December 1957), sometimes credited as Roy Deep, Gordeep Roy, or Deep Roy, is a Kenyan-born Indian actor I worked with this man he owned a restaurant and I was hired as a chef he is a horrible boss and a horrible person who treated his employees like shitThe restaurant industry brings out the worst in people. Its just so fucking hard to make a buck. I'll never own another dine-in establishment again. A take-out delivery joint or a food truck are where its at. Fuck the utility companies and fuck landlords, and fuck the ridiculous high standards the government imposes on immobile eateries. Fuck wait staff, and bussers and bartenders and hostesses. If you can't do it with 2 cooks and a cashier don't fucking do it.~~Deep Roy isn't Indian, he's from Nairobi.~~"
"EDIT: NevermindHis parents are both Indian.TIL, thanks for the correction. :)[deleted]> Deep Roy. Cool ~~band~~ porn name.He was also in a Blake's Seven episode as a chess master.Thanks for giving me a reason to re watch blake's seven and spelling it correctly ;-)He's also Frodo in LOTR. Don't know why you're getting the downvotes man, he totally was Frodo. He was Elijah's body double in loads of medium & long shots and wore a rubber Frodo mask. Incidentally, Kiran Shah was also a a body double, can't remember which hobbit he played though.That's deep, Roy.What a man. more like Shallow Roy"
"32 on-set photos of Christian Bale and Heath Ledger during the interrogation scene from THE DARK KNIGHT, accompanied with Christopher Nolan interview bytes breaking down the sceneHow do you fight someone who thrives on conflict? I love that line. That's exactly like dealing with an annoying roommate. How do you end that which has no beginningI genuinely love how the joker was basically defeated by the saying the winning move is to not play[deleted]Exactly. Joker rigs two boats to with explosives and two detonators inside their boats. The threat is that if someone does not press the switch at midnight, both boats will blow up."
"Now if anyone had decided to push the button, they could've either blown the other boat up or even blow themselves up. Regardless, they are in a lose-lose situation if they press the button, so the only way to win is **to not do anything**, which is what both people in the boat decide to do - throw away the detonator."
"For more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemmaI don't know if I agree.... The winning move would have been to immediately blow the other boat sky-high, because they both would have been blown up at midnight if neither had pressed their detonator. They got saved by the rule about both boats being blown up at midnight being broken because batman takes care of things.So Batman finds this bomb, right? And he needs to figure out what to do with it. And he's running all over the place and this bomb is about to go off, and he has *no idea* what to do with it. He goes one way, and there's a group of nuns. Another, and it's girl scouts. He even tries to throw it in the river! And whaddya know? Baby ducks."
"Some days, you just can't get rid of a bomb.[Old School](http://youtu.be/OsJA1C19AyE?t=6s)That was The Dark Knight Rises.The two boats, they don't pull the trigger on the bombs, leaving their fate in the hands of the other boat, hoping they do the same thing. It's the redeeming moment amidst all the chaos."
"The line in /u/mach-2's response is most well known from War Games, where the computer plays Global Nuclear War, and in the end, learns that the only winning move in such a game is not to play.Nicely articulated.This is especially cool in Frank Miller's _The Dark Knight Returns_ where Batman has grown old and retired.  As a direct result, the Joker has gone into a catatonic state.  Things happen, I won't ruin any more, but the first reaction they get from the Joker after years of catatonia is when Batman does what the title says he does.It's awesome that you mentioned this, because I've read the graphic novel, but I just found out that DC made an animated movie out of it. I knew they did Year One, but had not realized they made Dark Knight Returns into two parts. So I'm in the process of watching that."
"It's pretty interesting all of the small story details that they took right out of Dark Knight Returns and used in the films.[Link to interrogation scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnOLhXmhkyA)So I have a question. When he asks who is batman going for and batman says racheal but then doesnt go for her, did batman ignore the question and say racheal as a command for gordon to go save racheal but because of the miss communication no one saves racheal[deleted]That doesnt really make sense does it. IF he swapped the address than batman would end up at harveys and gordan would be at racheal, but they all go back to the same place with harvey. Which brings back my original questionWhatever Batman wanted the most-his choice-he'd lose. Didn't matter who lived, bats lost. They don't all end up at the same place... Batman saves Harvey, but Gordon doesn't reach Rachel in time.This scene has always given me that nice tingly ASMR feeling. Until Batman starts beating him upAfter having watched Sherlock, the dynamic between the Joker and Batman is incredibly similar to that of Sherlock and Moriarty. Heath Ledger was just amazing at playing that role.Which kinda upset me. I think the actor who played Moriarty was trying too hard to be the Joker. Moriarty is an intellectual, a mastermind, Holmes's equal. He's not crazy. Harris's portrayal in Game of Shadows is how he should be, I think.[removed]It's the second movie with Robert Downey Jr.I agree. Sherlock is set in modern day, it's meant to be different. So, that's why Moriarty is like that.I absolutely love how Ledger watches the punch coming toward his face while laughing, pure gold.Thanks for sharing this clip!"
"I love when the Joker gets slammed on the table and says, Look at you *go*!"
"That mock encouragement fits him well.Watching the again, one of the most disturbing and strange things about the Joker was the tongue stuff he did. The non-speaking sounds, the lips smacking, the moist sound of his mouth opening, and the way his tongue flicks around is just so gross and inhuman. I never noticed it before, watching the film, but here it stands out as something very uncomfortable to me.You complete me - Can someone explain what he meant by this line ?"
"Edit: Thanks for the replies! Didn't know that the line is from Jerry Maguire. Has Tom or any other cast member from the movie spoken about this ?It's from Merry JcGuire That line is why so many are upset about Gotham.  JOKER CANNOT EXIST WITHOUT BATMAN.reference to jerry maguire (romantic film) while stating the strong relationship joker and batman have in the sense that one exists because of the otherHe explains this several times; Batman is the Unstoppable Force, Joker is the Immovable Object. They are perfectly complimentary. Bruce Wayne is a genius, and a warrior. The Joker is correct in saying all his strength is useless."
"I love how Nolan describes that scene and how futile all the violence is.."
"The Joker is eating it up too.. He LOOOVES that he's pissing off Batman."
"Oh, you're hitting me? Good.. that means I'm winning... All of what everybody said, plus check this out:"
"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVok-7tDFF8The Joker is looked at as a freak or as an insane human being.  The joker hates being viewed this way:"
"This is revealed:"
"-The first scene with Gamble and the mob, Gamble calls the joker a freak and clearly it gets under his skin"
"-The scene with the burning pile of money when the italian says they won't work for a freak (the Joker gets infuriated)"
"The Joker wants to prove that everyone, if put in the correct circumstances, will act against their morals and if put in extreme circumstances, will develop a similar mindset as that of his.  Ultimately, this can show that the joker is not a freak or crazy in fact that he's just like everyone else or everyone else is just like him."
"Batman is the perfect example of someone that truly believes he has unbreakable morals.  Corrupting the batman would prove everything the joker stands for.  And finally, his point that given the circumstances people will turn to evil/selfish acts, therefor, justifying his own actions. Killing the batman, however, would prove nothing."
"Examples of the jokers goals and world view: (only a few of many more)"
"-Harvey Dent's corruption is the Joker's ace in the hole"
"-The Jokers says its about sending a message... Everything burns"
"-The Joker says their morals, their code, it's a bad joke. Dropped at the first sight of trouble."
"-The batman says what were you trying to prove? That deep down everyone is as ugly as you?"
"-When the batman says This city just showed you its filled with people who are ready to stand up for good to which the joker replies until their spirits break completely"
"-The Joker's final social experiment, making people directly confront their morals"
"-The Joker is fine with the batman hitting him (killing him)"
"-The Joker laughs as batman throws him off the building"
"This is all imo!"
"Check out the song by Coheed and Cambria called [Deranged](http://youtu.be/OREEvnW51Mw), they wrote and recorded it for the Arkham City soundtrack but it really explains the Batman/Joker relationship very well overall. Simply put, they balance each other out."
"The Yin and the Yang."
"Duality.Without the batman... The joker has no punch line.The Joker only exists because of Batman. One doesn't know exactly what he was doing before Batman came on the scene, but it was only after Wayne came back to Gotham as a symbol of incorruptible justice (no killing) that this criminal saw the need to aspire to something greater and terrible."
"Where Batman is ideal hero, the Joker is the ideal criminal. That means to say that they are each symbols of their respective positions. Batman wants to show the people of Gotham, who had lost all hope for their city, that there was still good in the world (Batman Begins covers a lot of his motivation) while the Joker wants to show that people are, in the end, horrible.  Each is trying to prove the other wrong"
"Without Batman to fight, the Joker is just another criminal. He needs Batman to create the ideal that he tries to corrupt.  Batman is the Jokers sole source of entertainment. If batman was gone the joker would have nothing to look forward to. The Joker sees Batman as the second side of the same coin. He needs him to be there and stop him, just as Batman needs him as a reason to keep upholding his views. I think.Without Batman there to try and stop him [the joker] whenever he was doing something big then it wouldn't be fun for him anymore without his great enemy there to fight him when he wanted to do something bad. Without Batman he wouldn't have fun.Who else would be as much fun as Batman for The Joker?Essentially, Joker represents chaos and Batman represents order. They're polar opposites and each has something the other does not.Joker had just watched Jerry Maguire.Yin and yang. The Joker needs someone like Batman, otherwise he just wanders aimlessly"
"Crappy explanation, but do you get the gist of it?Like the Joker said, just ripping off the mafia is no fun. He needs a rival to fulfill him, to give his life meaning. He was talking about how Batman's presence of justice is the yin to the Joker's yang of insanity."
"I think he was using the line you complete me in an almost sarcastic way to say this by referring to this iconic scene from the movie Jerry McGuire https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpWAlvWNZj0 Batman is basically the opposing force that creates the conflict in which he thrives on.It's a line from Jerry Maguire. The Joker is just toying with Batman, almost mocking him.Almost?I mean, he doesn't want to be mean or anything.The Joker is Batman's foil. The joker thrives off of chaos. He's not motivated by money or power, he only wants to prove his theory to the world that nobody is completely pure. You can cause anyone to compromise their morals if you push them far enough. Batman is his biggest challenge, he wants to make Batman go against his morals and kill. Batman isn't that different from the Joker. Both are geniuses, both of them are crazy (who dresses up as a bat to fight crime?) and both want to prove something to the world. The fundamental difference is that one is chaos and the other is justice. So each of them exists to stop what the other one is doing.Batman can't exist without the Joker and the Joker can't exist without Batman. Good can't exist if there is no bad, because if there is only good, then it's not good it's normal. Just like lightness needs darkness to exist and darkness needs lightness to exist.Really more so that the Joker can't exist without Batman. Batman literally already existed without the Joker. To Batman, there are always criminals. For The Joker it's much more important that there be someone *special* for him to oppose."
"I think this is a good point, and I feel like a lot of people overlook it.  Batman completes the Joker, because the Joker is completely obsessed with him.  Everything is about Batman, in one way or the other.  It's not a two way street.  Batman certainly hates the Joker, but he's just another criminal."
"In the comics, you can see how this plays out with Harley Quinn too, since she has a similar obsession with the Joker that Joker has with Batman.  Interestingly, the only two times I've really seen Batman mad at the Joker from a personal standpoint was Jason Todd's murder and the episode Mad Love, where he saw the Joker actually beat Harley.  There are probably others, but those two stand out to me.In Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker, there's an awesome flashback scene at one point where Batman gets pretty pissed. Don't want to drop a spoiler in case you haven't seen it - it's such a great movie and my favorite animated DC film.It's not Good and Bad."
"It's order and chaos. It's also a reference to Jerry Maguire. Batman and Joker are having a romantic moment together.This is all true, while at the same time just showing the Joker's cheeky nature by throwing in a quote from the movie Jerry Maguire. Most of these guys miss the point."
"The Joker is Batman's true nemesis. They are in a conflict that can not be resolved, a stalemate. Batman is guided by his principles of not killing. The joker, an entity who's whole mission is to prove even the incorruptible can be corrupted, desperately wants batman to kill him. If he could cause enough pain, enough terror, enough pure chaos as to overthrow even Batman's principled set of virtues, then he will have completed his goal. Batman can't kill the joker, as it would destroy the very nature of the vigilant."
"The Joker, on the other hand, is intent on corrupting batman, showing that even he is just a man. This is why the Joker is shouting, do it, do it, I want you to do it during the scene where his truck just crashed. He wants to corrupt the purity of Batman's goodness (as he did with Harvey's) by letting Batman kill the Joker."
"So to answer your question, the You complete me, is a reference to this unbreakable stalemate. The joker lives to die by Batman's hand, and the batman lives to prove he can stop the evil without becoming, himself,  evil. This is one of Bruce's greatest challenges in any cannon, to deal with looking down at the black hole at can be humanity at it's most vile, and not becoming the demon himself."
"They are as he puts it, what happens when an unstoppable force (The Jokers cruelty) meets and immovable object (the Batman's moral code). Without the batman, the joker would have no entity so incorruptible... The Joker, simply put, needs Batman's existence to vindicate his, by ending his.  [deleted]What Heath said during that scene happens in the Dark Knight Rises."
"These civilised people will eat each otherDark Knight Rises is less civilized people eating each other and more criminals being let out of prison, joining a terrorist organization, and ransacking the city."
"If the Foley character had joined Bane, then that would be making Joker's point. Or if Catwoman had reveled in and enjoyed what had happened. But the reality of it was much different for her. And Foley stood up in the end."
"civilized* :)"
"Not just TDKR.  It's a commentary on society in general.When? It wasn't civilised people, it was bane and his buddies. Nah, during that scene where people are looting the super rich, its more than just Bane and his people.A good portion of Gotham's population joined in with the looting and rioting. Bane didn't have that many mercenaries with him.He broke a lot out of black gate prison. While true, they actually show the people riot, kill, and steal from other citizens.  At least initially.Those are probably still the released inmates. It's not like they'd keep those jumpsuits on.It's clearly the citizens.  There was nowhere near enough inmates even released.  The characters even point out what the people are doing to each other.I think really what he was referring to was the ferry scene at the end of TDK. Joker expected the people on the ferries to rush to blow up the others to save themselves, 'when the chips are on the table'. See, I'm not a monster - I'm just ahead of the curve. I love that!The soundtrack really adds to the scene, I love how it builds the tensionCollege Humor has done a hilarious spoof of the scene:"
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Svd4fe8HEZII just realized, he said at the end he's going for Rachel, but in the film he saves Dent. Did Joker switch the addresses on him?Yes.The have a lot of Batman spoofs, and they are all hilarious.IT REALLY SEALS IN THE FLAVOR!!You tamed my monster. With your mouthTWO-FACE!"
"What have you done with Harvey-Face and Scary-Face?!Well I guess that's the end...of Scary Face"
"...Give me my kid dipshitHARVEY DENT"
"CAN WE TRUST HIMLucious! If you shoot me, I'll riddle you. What am I?"
"Is it - helicopters?"
"I know, right? HARVEY WATCH OUT FOR TWO FACEThis scene is so fucking raw.This is the first time I have actually recognized Heath Ledger under all the makeup. I still have a hard time picturing Heath in joker uniform. Only the hair I can tell it's Heath. [deleted]It's his eyes between takes.There is no Heath, there is only Joker.Werent you gone already?[deleted]Be faster![PURGED]Seems like it. I hate time travelling liars.Did yall come here from the most mysterious crap on reddit thread on the front page after looking at the time travelers profile?No.  I'm from the year 2091.  Some asshole from 2081 left some shit behind.  This is the last time we ever give an intern a task like this.  ffs.YeahYes xpYep.Right? For years I've always seen his Joker as a person, not even a character.I recognized him in the first few pictures but after a while he really morphed into his role. He seriously immersed himself in the Joker.Same here, and that's in no way an exaggeration. There's only one shot in the whole movie where I can tell it's Heath (when they're on top on the highrise). In the mob kitchen scene, it's impossible for me.The only shot where I actually recognize him is when he has no makeup on, right before he tries to kill the mayor, but shoots Jim Gordon.Oh, yeah. That's probably 100% because of him wearing no make up though. I was referring to the times he wears make up.He still had the scars though which was makeupFor me, it's the beginning of the interrogation scene, but only because his makeup is so faded.  It's scary how much he immersed himself into the character.Yeah, I agree. Why is the make up faded btw? It's so strong in the mob scene and then just flat in the interrogation and highrise scenes.He just got arrested, and he had that big fight with the police and got beaten up by Batman.  I figured that's what caused some of the smudging.  Maybe it's for a different reason, though.  Like, maybe it's to make him seem more human?Apparently Nolan is quoted as stating that the make up is a reflection of the joker's mental state. As the joker degraded into periods of greater insanity, the make up coverage and quality becomes more faded and haphazard. At times of greater lucidity the make up is clearer and better defined Oh, right.. I've heard that too. That's probably it! I don't want to be that guy but I can't find the source anywhere. Could be urban legend but I like to believe it's true. It makes sense when you watch the film I think I heard it in a video. Could be BTS material.Because it the joker hadn't fixed his makeup up. He a been through some shit since it was last applied.Does not compute...Nolanverse = makeup"
"Most other 'verses = chemical burns or otherHeath couldn't have been more different then joker. What got me was the mouth thing, where he's kind of swallowing spit, there's clearly something wrong with his mouth/saliva set up now he's been cut. I've seen people who are kind of seedy and high do that but to integrate that tiny gesture into the character. Having seen people with drug ticks irl,my brain was telling me to get the fuck out and run away from this guy.I liken it to banes tiny gesture of lightly putting his hand on the other guy and asking do you feel in control?. Or the pencil trick. Those tiny nuances that scream at you a person is very dangerous and they promise violence. They reached out to me on a very primal levelIt was the face paint. It was not supposed to be part of his Joker persona. He used to do it because the paint used to dry this lips. Nolan liked it and didn't stop Heath Ledger from doing it. [deleted]I thought it was on purpose too, until I saw video of Nolan saying he noticed ledger doing it and asked why, he said it was because of the makeup and asked if he should stop. Nolan said no, he felt it added something creepy so to say to the joker character, and that a man with a slit mouth would do something like that so he wanted him to keep that little quirk.[deleted]> Originally, at the end of that scene, once the Joker reveals his information, Christian dropped him and then, almost as an afterthought, he kicked him in the head as he walked out of the room. We wound up removing that bit. It seemed a little too petulant for Batman in a way."
"I agree. Wouldn't have made sense.I want deleted scenes SOOOOO BADLY!!!Yeah Batman ain't some Eastern European gangster in a full Nike outfitNo. Just Nike shoes.I like the idea of Joker getting under Batman's skin, but I agree...that's too much particularly at that point in the film.Oddly enough, that's how Batman interrogated in Arkham City. Batman would hold up a thug by the shirt (or hold him over the edge of a building) and knock him out cold after getting the information he wanted."
"Edit: Arkham has one of my favorite Batman lines. When you go around bullying people for info, he'll occasionally say, Lie to me if you're done eating solid food. I think that was more out of gameplay necessity than anything. Usually you interrogate a guy after beating up a group of his pals. It would be weird to just let him go after, and most players would knock him out anyway.Definitely. When I first played the game, I expected Bats to just tie the guy up for the police or something. But watching him give the poor guy the thunder clap concussion was also fine. You missed a spot"
"*kick*That's some worldstar hip hop shit.Imagine him saying You just got worldstar'd! in that croaky batman voice of his.***WORLDSTARRR!!!***I imagine the whole room with gordan just yelling WORLD STAR!! WURLD STAARR!! as the fight begins.What a beautiful talk through. Really gives you an insight into the production of a movie such as that. The considered detail, the feelings the director is aiming for... I feel I have been watching movies in such an immature way now.It truly is amazing just *how much* thought and craft and incredibly effort goes into making a great film that we just never have any awareness of, especially things like the lighting and camera work and set design. We are so easily manipulated by the way we see things."
"That's the thing.  Even the shittiest movies you see mean something to someone, and as shitty as they may be, the amount of effort the cast and crew put into really any project is no joke at all.  I'm currently working on composing the music and directing for a short film that I wrote, but the enormous amount of effort and time I'm putting into this project is purely out of passion and love.  I want to make it as perfect as possible because the project, even if it might be criticized, means so much to me.  That's why I don't mind some (not all) of the movies that are heavily criticized because those movies mean something to the people who put so much effort into it.  Otherwise, why would they waste so much of their lives doing something they don't give a shit about?  That's also why I really really don't like the Razzies because it completely destroys the meaning of film making."
"TL;DR  Shitty art is still art if it means something to someone.Man, Batman's suit looked really slick in that movie.I hated how big his head looks. looks like hes wearing a helmet underneath, which he essentially is but I dont like how much it shows.This is the problem with what real body armor would look like on a real human body. This has always been a big problem of adapting a comic book outfit to the real world. Comic artists tend to consider clothing and armor as being about one molecule layer thick.Hockey padsThey got rid of the big neck, which is a shame as its an intimidating look, but you can't move your head like that. Which is why I worry Batfleck will suffer the same stiffness.Batfleck's armor is going to be more of a cloth type, stretchable stuff, so there's going to be quite some mobility as well as some martial arts stuff we can finally see Batman doing as opposed to a bulletproof Batman just shoving his way through lackeys in DK/DKR. Batfleck looks more like a comic Batman, so his cowl could be made of a thinner, more flexible material, allowing him to turn his head.How did Keaton pull it off? http://photos.imageevent.com/batmanonfilm/bofimages/michael-keaton-batman_B89.jpgHe turned his whole torso.Well, his was made of Fruit Roll-Up so he pulled it off fairly easily.I don't think Keaton ever turned his head in the suit; if I recall correctly, he would quickly turn his torso instead.One scene in Batman (1989) called for Michael Keaton to turn and look up towards the Joker (Jack Nicholson), who was shouting down at him from a helicopter. Due to being unable to turn his head, Keaton had to move his entire body to look, resulting in a turn that was later dubbed as the Hero Turn.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP9fFSc2Rx0He always looked like he had a sore neck, he would turn his head and shoulders as one. Bale pulled it off too. Batman Begins had sculpted leather head, as wall as the Keaton's Batman."
"Problem is, you can't really move your neck in it. You have to move whole torso."
"There's nice in-movie explanation in TDK, where Wayne wants to sacrfice protection of the original suit for bigger mobility advantage.It made backing out of the driveway easier.I know it's been said to death, but Heath Ledger seriously screwed every future actor playing Joker."
"EDIT: Was just reminded what a cousin told me after he took his kids to see the movie. In the middle of one Joker scene (I don't recall which), he turns and sees his 9yo son's face, transfixed on the screen, ...a silent tear sliding down his cheek.Willem dafoe would make a rockin joker.5 years ago I would've said the same thing. Hell, a year ago I might've said the same thing. But I think they've established a nice new cinematic universe that's different enough for a fresh take on the Joker to work. Something more along the lines of The Killing Joke's Joker. A dark, but more quiet and intimidating Joker. Possibly played by someone like Adrian Brody or Sharlto Copley or Guy Pearce or Jackie Earle Haley or Steve Coogan.and he also screwed lindsay lohan. I don't know, I could see a very campy joker working, with a voice similar to Mark Hamill (who will, to me, always be *the* Joker).Go watch season 2 of the show Hannibal. Michael Pitt would be an AMAZING New 52 Joker, in my opinion.You could have said that about Jack Nicholson, but it wasn't true.Meh, I prefer Jack.  Cesar Romero is where its at yoI disagree. But I respect your opinion. Sucks that you'll take shit for that. Jack's performance was brilliant. It fit the mood of the film perfectly. There's no place in Burton's Bativerse for Heath Ledger's Joker, just as there's no place in Nolan's for Nicholson's.Yeah that's true, and awesome."
"He did such a good job and I really didn't know much of Heath Ledger before his role as the Joker, but his role really made this movie for me."
"I'm sad that he died before he could do any more awesome roles.I think Chris Pine could be the next Joker. If you watch the first JJ Abram's Star Trek movie; the scene where he is in the bar after being beat up, about to be offered recruitment, you can see him do this shit with his mouth that I felt was so reminiscent of Heath's Joker. I think he could look, and play, that very same role.Good call. Even better sign would be his small part in Smokin Aces. I said to myself Self, that guy's gonna be somebody.Smokin Aces was so awesome. Except for that stairwell scene between Alisha Keys and Common. That was god awful. I think it was supposed to be a tribute to old blaxploitation films, but it came off so cheesy and out of place.You know, I've thought that if Johnny Depp would stop playing in these formulaic, mass marketed Hollywood blockbusters and start actually doing the more artistic stuff like he did earlier in his career, that he might actually be able to pull the role off.  He might over-act it, but if he could approach it with any subtly, I think he could pull of Ledger's Joker."
"I'm not saying it would be the same, and honestly we'll never know, but he's the only actor I think stands a chance with the look (similar enough to Ledger), talent, and eccentricity to pull it off."
"I'm also aware he's done recent stuff a little more off the grid (e.g. Rum Diaries), but his other more popular roles are just terrible.I think Jack White could play and amazing joker.Hamill did some amazing work as The Joker in animated, and later in video game form. He goes to some pretty similarly amazing and dark places in the first two Arkham Games."
"He raised the bar. You'll just get different interpretations.Really. What a dick, right?mark hamill still stands apart. not better or worse, but different enough that they can't be compared. And iconic enough to command respect/recognition. It's been said to death but I honestly think Heath ledger as the Joker might be the greatest role I've ever seen, ever. I don't think words can describe how well he did it. I don't think anyone will ever do another acting role protaganist or antaganist for that matter, as good as he did this role. Every time I hear someone mention a relatively recent movie with those words, I want to encourage them to see more film... not to be a contrarian but because there's so much more out there for you to revel in.   Immediately coming to mind is Peter Lorre as Hans Beckert in Fritz Lang's *M*.  But I think that's what a great performance does.  People who read up on Heath's Joker probably were inspired to check out *The Man Who Laughs* and then branch out to other works from there.  That's the great thing about film... decades upon decades of material to choose from rather than waiting for the one film out of a zillion this year that doesn't entirely suck."
"A friend of mine cast Heath in a film on the basis of his small but meaningful role in *Monster's Ball*.  He was easily the most studious, involved and concerned with understanding every aspect of his role... and brought that same kind of intense study to his craft in *TDK*... What I would say is that there aren't a lot of actors that have so heavily immersed themselves in a role."
"And one does not have to.  Marcello Mastroianni was always of the opinion that DeNiro didn't need to spend three months being a cab driver to get inside the head of a cab driver."
"What made Heath's Joker interesting was that so much of it came from him sitting in a room figuring out Joker in his own head, having read from Killing Joke and Year One and building on that.  What Ledger did was very detailed, intricate... I marvel at the little touches/tics and nuances he threw in giving Joker a rich kind of texture (notice how he keeps changing the story of how he got the scars or the scene of him talking to Dent in the hospital)... I think that there is potential for others to make Joker incarnations that are memorable in their own way, but once you are dealing in a realm of craft like that it's not about who is better than whom.  It's just different styles."
"The greatest drummers aren't sitting around comparing who is better.  They're all of equal technical competence but have different ways of translating the notes on the page.  Same thing here."
"But Heath definitely was an exceptional actor... I just don't know if my friend could handle seeing him as Joker because of how much he put into it.   It would really only further the tragedy of losing someone so enormously gifted and hard working.I totally agree. Not to take anything away from Ledger's work at all, but...there is just SO MUCH amazing film and acting out there. Your excellent examples, not to mention Takashi Shimura in Ikiru, hell so much of Kurosawa's work. And not just the obvious stuff like his samurai films and shakespeare adaptations. Stray Dog is an amazing film and probably still my favorite performance from Toshiro Mifune. There's Alec Guinness in Bridge Over The River Kwai...just so many to list."
"I love our modern superhero films as much as anyone, but I wish more of the people who love those films would use them as a reason to explore the amazing history of film beyond the big Summer blockbusters."
"And you're right, trying to rank the best actor of all our great actors is largely meaningless and arbitrary. What's important is not who is the greatest, but that so many are great, often in such different ways."
"As someone in film production myself, I find absolutely nothing wrong with people enjoying Heath's incredible run as the Joker. It's a tour de force performance, and evaluating it is always going to be subjective. I'm with you right there on Lorre in M. I think the problem simply lies with the hyperbole of greatest performance. Once you reach a certain level of aptitude with acting ability, it becomes very difficult to compare and contrast different roles. I don't think we can even juxtapose performances separated by several decades, there's just too much changing behind the scenes in terms of culture, technology and the evolving style of direction. I'm not saying we can't compare a crappy new role with a classic great one, it's when we look at two performances that reach critical acclaim in two different time periods, it gets a little fuzzy for me."
"And definitely, people should watch as much as possible to get a sense of the history of filmmaking and where their favorite movies fit in the spectrum.Nah, the Joker as a cultural icon transcends his performance. The hype is dissipating and eventually someone will put another spin on it and we'll all be talking about that.only if they try to copy his act. If a new actor will interpret joker it their own way it might be just as good, in different way.Tofegerl is right, the same was said of Jack N. Ultimately there will be comparisons but considering the direction DC is taking the movies it doesn't seem like an impossible task. I think Michael Pitt(Mason Verger on Hannibal) could play a very good Joker, the dude is nuts on the showBut everyone would criticize how close he is to heath ledger's jokerEspecially if Michelle Williams or Mary Kate Oslen ever want to play The Joker. [Well done.](http://img.pandawhale.com/38897-Christian-Bale-upvote-gif-jIu0.gif)I don't care if Michelle Williams plays a table lamp, I will watch every bit of her.Troy Baker. He can give a Hamill imitation and he's still young enough. Can he act though? I know he is a [good voice actor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCjJM2oo3EU#t=75) but we have never seen him in front of a camera.[The Last of Us: One Night Live.](http://youtu.be/aAhT9gbmOtw?t=34m45s) Beware. Massive spoilers for the game.Can't watch because I haven't played it yet, but I'll take your word for it.We thought the same about Nicholson. I still think he did a fantastic Joker, it's just a different Joker for a different Batman movie. If there's a new Batman series with a different direction, a different Joker will be needed.Right. Think back [the Joker of The Dark Knight Returns](http://imgur.com/O7n0Tfr), for instance. If Batman Vs. Superman decides to go down that road, he's got this highly effeminate 80s rock star type appearance about him, he's like Peter O'Toole playing David Bowie playing the Joker, and yet is still completely horrifying (especially in the fairly recent animated version where he's voiced by Michael Emerson (Benjamin Linus from LOST)."
"Heath Ledger's joker is Iconic and extremely memorable, but it's certainly not the only valid way to play the character, and I doubt that it's the last  time we'll see a very memorable big-screen adaptation of the character.I highly recommend watching the animated movie of this. The Dark Knight Returns. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2313197/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1"
"Really great and perhaps the best animated movie from DC yet.Does it matter if I don't really have much knowledge of the batman universe (outside the Nolan movies) to watch this?Nope...I watched it being new to this sub and I enjoyed it very much!Callan Mulvey has been casted and rumored to be Joker in BvS: DOJ. If that is true, good luck topping Ledger. Crispin would make an awesome RiddlerI wouldn't call it screwed as much as he raised the bar like Jack Nicholson did before him. His incarnation is however responsible for bringing gravitas to comic book roles in the eyes of the academy.Not really. He was an exception. RDJ deserved something for Tony Stark but has never seen any real recognition. Don't see anyone getting any real looks for an award int he future.Not sure if being yourself counts as acting though.RDJ did great for playing a version of Tony Stark. He's actually not that much like the comic Tony Stark."
"The kind of effort that one has to put into playing a Joker like Heath's is very different than playing a character like Stark.Yeah, he got what he deserved - a Kid's Choice awardHis acting isn't award worthy at all RDJ hardly _acted_ like Tony Stark. RDJ is a great actor but has basically been playing versions of himself for the past few years."
"Heath Ledger totally transformed himself for this role.He is fantastic to watch in that role, but couldn't it just be he is basically reliving his real life from 20 years ago with a suit of armor? :)RDJ as Tony Stark gave the breath of life that was needed for both the viewer and movie execs to take Comic Book movies seriously.I think RDJ was cast perfectly for Tony Stark, and he played the part with ease, but Marvel's movies, while usually very good, only occasionally end up being great. Meanwhile, with DC, they're usually mediocre, if that, or on occasion astounding. The Dark Knight ~~Rises~~ was astounding, and Heath Ledger was easily the best part in my opinion."
"It also seems like it would be a lot harder to play the role of the Joker and make it both believable and serious, than it would be to play a billionaire/playboy/asshole. I could be wrong about this, as I couldn't act my way out of a puppet show, but assuming it's correct, there's another reason."
"Edit: Okay, so I don't know what films are called, but pretend I do.> The Dark Knight ~~Rises~~ was astounding, and Heath Ledger was easily the best part in my opinion."
"The Dark Knight Rises was the third film, with Tom Hardy as Bane."
"I think that's why he crossed out the Rises but still wanted it noted that the third was also great."
"That said, Tom Hardy's Bane is probably my favourite of Bane. I hated that concept of the venom and glad they explored him as being more a mercenary. Actually just the overall style was supremely better."
"Tom Hardy is definitely my favourite actor.Unpopular Opinion"
"RDJ is great at playing Tony, but he's not award winning great. He does define the character because he's the first one to play it in a mainstream movie. I really think Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans do a better job  portraying their characters, but Tony just seems to be there to make you laugh, besides saving the world."
"Edit: Not so unpopular apparently.....False.RDJ also has a way of stepping on his lines, especially in Iron Man 3. [You walked right into this one I've dated hotter chicks than you.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=zuX-Lnor7OU#t=137) That line reading was just as bad as Storms You know what happens when a toad is hit by lighting? line from X-Men.Those lines are just badly written. It's most certainly not the actor's fault.Really? I liked that line :(HuhrtpChris Hemsworth plays Thor like a big dumb brute, I don't see how his performance is better than RDJ. He did define the character. In the comics, there was a bit of what we see from time to time, but Tony stark wasn't really your lovable asshole party boy that you just couldn't say no to because he was so charmingly sarcastic. He was more just brilliant inventor/businessman, rdj took it to a whole new level."
"Sure, you can probably cite examples that show he was that guy in the comics, but the characterization wasn't as strong or definitive until rdj. I'd have to agree, simply because Tony Stark isn't an award winning role. Awesome, but not award winning.I never read comic books, but I have a basic understanding of who most the characters are and how they should be represented. And to me, RDJ defines who Tony Stark would be. An eccentric billionaire struggling with his demons and alcoholism (which they didn't touch on in the films but should have)."
"I'm a huge comic book buff, been reading Iron man and the Avengers in multiple universes for years. RDJ perfectly embodied Tony Stark. It may not be award-winning purely in terms of cinema, but it *is* award-winning in terms of translating a complex character from print to the screen."
"RDJ did as good a job portraying Tony Stark/Iron Man as Ledger did portraying the Joker, when it comes to really becoming the comic book version of their characters.Really?  I think Hemsworth is a one note character in Thor.  Evans is great in CA through.I think all three were incredibly well cast. It's not easy to land on the ideal actor, especially when you're starting a franchise."
"I think the folks over at Spiderman are pretty jealous. Tobey McGuire was *okay*, Andrew Garfield is brutal. Brutal is good or bad? > Andrew Garfield is brutal."
"Holy shit, thank you. I saw the most recent one in theaters - that scene where he breaks up with Gwen (in the middle of the street...?) because of some promise he made to her dad was one of the worst displays of acting I've seen in a long time."
"...part of it has to be the writing, which is also very sub-par. But Andrew Garfield always looks like he's on the brink on collapsing into tears. How he and Emma Stone managed to have zero chemistry on screen despite dating IRL is beyond me. Makes you think about how stale their actual relationship is...Have you ever seen Mr. and Mrs. Smith?"
"Recipe: take the two sexiest human beings on Earth, make sure they are a serious couple in real life, make sure they are both at least good actors, put them in a movie as a couple."
"Result: No fucking chemistry"
">How he and Emma Stone managed to have zero chemistry on screen despite dating IRL is beyond me."
"HahahahahahahahahahahahahHH spot on observation!"
"But I don't think it was from lack of trying on Stones part! I don't see Garfield having chemistry with anyone in that character, they made him almost too nerd/awkwardI'm not sure anyone can criticize Andrew since Sony, the writer and director are 110% to blame"
"They fucked it up so bad and made such terrible movies that they had to basically CANCEL/DELAY part 3 because everyone hated the movies so much."
"(Compared to other big budget films of course)"
"Doesn't matter what actor you throw in there if the writing and direction is great."
"Case in point: Drax from GotG. Perfect character written exactly for what Bautista can do and not reaching into things he can't. Not a good actor but used perfectly."
"I personally like AG as spiderman. I think the writing could be better. But his persona to a certain degree fits well with Peter Parker. Much more than Tobey."
"I do know Peter was a bit mopey dopey in the beginning, but TM basically Annakin'd the role. Too much on the emotional spectrum. AND of course thankfully we had a great actress play Gwen in the new movies, while MJ was perhaps the worst casting i have seen in terms to personality differences in comics and in the movie.I think Tobey is a great Peter and Andrew is a great Spider-Man. If they could somehow mesh the two together then they would be perfect.    'If they could somehow"
"mesh the two together then"
"they would be perfect'I think you're on to something. I don't mind Andrew Garfield when he's having fun and saying his goofy little Spiderman quips to the bad guys."
"But as /u/tokomini said, anything with emotional weight that involves channeling the character's vulnerability seems to be way too much for him. He's just not a very strong actor in that regard.>anything with emotional weight that involves channeling the character's vulnerability seems to be way too much for him."
"Are you serious? The chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone in the latest two movies was better than *anything* that Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst could put together in their wildest dreams. The casting decisions here were amazing. They totally knocked it out of the park. I cannot possibly imagine anyone other than Garfield playing the role right now, and [Amazing Spiderman 2](#s Stone's performance with him has made Gwen's death absolutely *devastating* for the audience from an emotional perspective.)"
"The Spiderman franchise's problem is Sony's insistence on constantly rebooting the goddamn story over and over again. There isn't anybody left who doesn't know how Peter Parker got his superpowers. They don't need to be telling the same shit over and over again. Yet that's exactly what they do, and then they act surprised when other superhero movies do better than them. And worse yet, when it was time to handle the 2nd installment with an original story, they turn it into a revolving door of villains. They dismantle the gravitas of Spiderman's challenges, because there's just so many of them."
"None of these failures have anything to do with the casting. It's all in the plot and creative direction. In fact, the entire reason why these movies haven't miserably flopped is precisely because they did a great job casting the roles. The actors managed to salvage what would otherwise be two very underwhelming experiences.[deleted]>No actor wants to play the same character for 20 years, so they have to reboot with new actors."
"They can cast new actors in the role and make a new movie every 4 years *without rebooting the goddamn origins story every single time*."
"James Bond has been an ongoing franchise for a very long ass time, with new actors in different eras, without repeating its story over and over and over again. It has offered new content for the moviegoers, with new casting, all in the same spirit and continuity of the franchise themes and stories."
"There's literally no reason why Sony could not do the same with the Spiderman franchise. And in fact, this is precisely what Disney-Marvel went on the record about when they publicized their intentions of using most of their current MCU heroes in a James Bond-ish fashion. There's an upcoming Captain America hand-off right now after Evans completes his 3-movie contract. All signs point to Sebastian Stan and his current character Bucky Barnes taking over the role."
"In fact there's a massive amount of Marvel comic book precedent for these kinds of hand-offs. The comic book Thor just very recently lost his right to wield Mjolnir, and a *woman* proved her worth instead. So now she took over the title of God of Thunder. Steve Rodgers handing off to Bucky Barnes is a very established and old storyline, and recently the shield changed hands again in the comic books. Hell, Peter Parker himself has three clones in the same continuity that take over under different real names, and there are two additional entirely new alter egos that take the Spiderman persona in different time eras."
"Fox rebooted their X-Men franchise with brand new actors while simultaneously retconning everything they've done in the past, and it was brilliant. Nobody was sad to see the old movies fall out of canon status. We have new Prof. X and Magnetos now. We have an entirely fresh start to *decades* of continuity, and nobody will bat an eye when they re-cast all of the established characters. Was that so difficult? No. They just had to put someone with half a brain in charge of the operation."
"So Sony doesn't exactly have a shortage of ideas here. They could just continue the same Peter Parker under different actors, or they could hand off to actual new comic book alter egos behind the same suit the way Disney-Marvel intends to handle Captain America. Both of these would be far superior options than to keep redoing the exact same origins story over and over again. We all know how Peter Parker got started. We know his uncle died. We know he got bitten by a radioactive spider. We don't need to be told all this shit again for the bazilyionth time just because there's a new actor playing the role.I agree with the character's vulnerability portion, but to me it's more of how they built their Peter Parker. I don't like how they made him a skater and more of an outsider when Parker is a science nerd. Tobey's Parker was perfect. The sweet, bumbling next door neighbor kid who always tried to see the good in people (minus the guy who killed his Uncle) and who had a smile on his face.You know who WAS cast perfectly in the Raimi trilogy? JK SimmonsI agree."
"I feel like he doesn't get enough credit for his perfect rendition of Jamieson. On par with Downey's role as Iron Man, he just simply didn't get much scene time. But then again, how could he? He's not a lead role.Probably why they're just ignoring him in the new shitty movies.Simmons? Ha! The guy's a hack! Washed up too, but nobody told him that. Brant, write that down. And get me a coffee. I am still paying you, aren't I? - J Jonah Jamieson, just there."
"Note: I wrote that in JK Simmons voice..."
"Edit: grammarAnd the Goblin, hot damn. That performance was amazing.Is there a role Willem DaFoe hasn't kicked ass in?RDJ plays Tony Stark as RDJ. Heath Ledger played the joker as something no one had ever seen before.Yeah but given his past, RDJ has some experience he can bring if/when they decide to tackle the demon in a bottle storyline. That's why I was happy when I heard he was cast as Tony. Tony Stark should get an Academy Award for playing RDJ irl. I think Chris Evans and Hemsworth are both pretty good, but RDJ is absolutely perfect as Tony Stark. I don't think it's possible to play that role any better.Granting that he's playing a very different Tony Stark than how he historically was usually portrayed in the comics. Comics Tony rarely came across as witty or charming."
"Presumably now he has effectively re-imagined the character such that comics writers have him in mind. I've read the same has happened with Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier."
"I suppose that's true, I'm more of a DC fan so I didn't ever read much pre-RDJ Iron Man. The same happened with Nick Fury though I think.Actually, Nick Fury is an interesting story. In the Ultimate Marvel universe, Nick Fury was redesigned to look like Samuel L Jackson, prior to Jackson's casting in the films. It wasn't until later that Nick Fury actually appeared onscreen.> Tony just seems to be there to make you laugh"
"Funny, I see Tony as a guy who is defined by his confrontations with his demons. There's humor in the Iron Man movies as well, but mainly I see Stark as a dramatic figure."
"I think all three of the actors you mentioned turned in stellar performances. Truly, all of them-- including RDJ-- inhabit their characters so thoroughly that we are entirely drawn into their admittedly absurd worlds. And much of the time they're reacting perfectly to CGI. Tom Hanks was praised by Robert Zemeckis, director of *Cast Away*, as being very good at looking at nothing; these guys are very good at *interacting* with nothing, and they do it so well that they are regularly accused of defining characters that have existed in print for decades. Definitely award-worthy."
"[Edit: Added the bit about defining existing characters.]I feel like RDJs life parallels Stark's which makes the performance so good and personal."
"he's a brilliant actor/scientist that squandered a lot of his youth and talent on women/drugs living a shallow playboy lifestyle but comes to a crossroads and turns his life around. it's a cliched but powerful redemption story that resonated personally for RDJ. >Funny, I see Tony as a guy who is defined by his confrontations with his demons."
"He fought with his alcoholism for what.. like 5 minutes before curing himself, basically?He probably wasn't actually an alcoholic.He was. They addressed it briefly in 2 (and it was a *HUGE* part of his character in the comics .. read Demon in a Bottle) before and during the party at Stark's house. After that he just kinda invented something for his arc reactor that cured it.That had nothing to do with alcoholism. He isn't an alcoholic in the movies.Then how do you explain Fury talking to him about it like it was a problem, and the fact that *it is addressed* in the second film considering the party debacle at his house?Alcoholism wasn't his main demon in MCU. It was the start of it in 2, but the story arc of his problems starts to pick up behind the scenes in The Avengers when he is confronted by the other members, mostly Captain America."
"His character in the movies is that of someone who narrowly escaped death at the start of Iron Man, to thinking he is invincible. Through Iron Man 1 and 2 this is pretty much proven to him a few times where he escapes death over and over. His ego inflates more and more and it isn't until the Avengers that he realizes that he isn't going to always win, and he can't protect everyone he loves."
"To your point about the humor, they tried to make him so cool that I found myself cringing at lines like Please don't tell me that there is a twelve year-old kid waiting in the car that I've never met.  It's like, we get it, you have sex.  The moments where he wrestles w/ the demons are much more interesting to me as well."
"Edit: is to are>To your point about the humor, they tried to make him so cool that I found myself cringing at lines like Please don't tell me that there is a twelve year-old kid waiting in the car that I've never met."
"It's really interesting that you just references a quote from Iron Man 3 and not from either of the other 2 movies, or The Avengers."
"I'd say that it's because Tony's wit and humor is genuine in the other movies. And they're hilarious because they build of a strong sense of self-identity. That's not the case in Iron Man 3. After the events of Iron Man 2 and The Avengers, we find Tony broken, wrestling with identity issues. He believes that the suit makes him Iron Man, but can he really be *the* Iron Man if his technology can be replicated, his suit can be built by others? Can he really defend the ones he loves against threats that he doesn't understand, from worlds he didn't know existed? And the awesome humor and wit he employed in the past *to entertain* is instead being employed to hide his problems from the world. That joke you're referencing is cringe-inducing because it's intended to be. That's the deliberate reaction the script wants to invoke, and apparently it succeeded."
"Hiding behind humor instead of dealing with our issues is one of the most omnipresent human reactions ever. I've lost count of how many comedians in real life had their lives cut short because they turned to alcohol and drugs to dull the edge, and hid it from everyone with their wit. We just lost Robin Williams to that recently. Tony's journey is a reflection of the same pattern of behavior. Iron Man 3 was his recovery and self-discovery -- the realization that Iron Man isn't the suit, but it's his resolve and his intelligence, and nobody can take those away from him.You are looking too much into the line. It was meant to be funny. To me, it was amusing. Apparently not to the op. Wow, that's a deep interpretation of ~~Lethal Weapon~~ Iron Man 3.I will admit he's great in the first one, but after that he just seems to be a comic relief character, at times. Other times he seems to be an important part of either his own story or the Avengers.Same with Hugh Jackman and wolverine.I thought the new hulk guy, ruffalo something, did a damn good job as bruce banner.I loved Norton. He really hit the scientist part of banner that I liked. It's a shame what happened and now hes not an avenger. RDJ is fantastic as Tony but it's still more RDJ being RDJ himself. Heath's performance was a complete 180 from his true persona ( Though some may argue it actually was a bit of his genuine character, especially during that period ).I don't know about Nicholson raising the bar. It could be because I watched Nicholson's Joker *after* Ledger's portrayal, but I honestly felt like I was watching a rank overacting amateur in Nicholson's case. I'll always struggle to believe that Nicholson raised any bar with his performance.I really truly do not like Nicholson's performance of Joker. It is just two hours of incredibly hammy scene-chewing and it drives me way out of the film."
"It also drives me nerd-ragey that they made the Joker be the guy that killed Bruce's parents. Batman is not supposed to get closure on his parent's murder, not ever. Every criminal he chases is the one that killed his parents, and he can never be satisfied in that."
"And if I could go my whole life without hearing that horribly cheesy dance with the devil in the pale moonlight line again, I would be very happy."
"I agree, but you gotta think of it in context. Before that movie general audiences only knew campy 60s Batman. In fact most grew up watching that as kids. Batman '89 pushed Batman into the right tone and we never would have had the awesome animated series or darker feel in later movies. I'm not crazy about it either, but Burton really made the right movie at the right time. I think the thing with the 1989 Batman is that it makes almost no attempt to even really be true to the comic book character. That's almost a saving grace for me-- the fact that it diverges so much and in a seemingly intentional way kind of lets me accept it and view the movie in a much less biased way."
"The movie was trying to tie together and make a sort of seminal, standalone, introductory, maybe, Batman story, and from that view I can understand wanting to have the Joker and the Batman be mutual creations of a sort, two twisted monsters born of the same event. Maybe. Will that appeal to comic book readers? Almost certainly not, I would say that most of the people I know who read the comics feel as similarly as you do about the Joker being involved in Thomas and Martha's deaths."
"The Tim Burton Batman almost felt like an Elseworlds, it was so strange. Batman saying he would kill people? Revealing his identity to people so easily? Bruce Wayne being far more neurotic and awkward than he was in any canon comic book incarnation? It was...certainly it's own beast."
"TL;DR: I agree. > I think the thing with the 1989 Batman is that it makes almost no attempt to even really be true to the comic book character."
"Yup, because the Tim Burton Batman films were darker, grittier versions of the old Adam West TV show, in my opinion. This continued through the following three, becoming greater and greater distortions of the campy show."
"Nolan's trilogy was the first to really dig into the comic books for style and mood, as I see it.Right, that makes perfect sense. I wasn't around when the Adam West show was playing (or when the 1989 Batman film aired, actually) so I'm woefully ignorant of that sort of contextual clarity. I kinda forget that was a thing. That's actually a really cool way of looking at it, thanks. The problem is we've had Batman for 75 years. From Batman using a gun to Silver Age Batman to Frank Miller's Batman, there have been so many different takes on the guy with entirely different styling, mood and personality."
"Nolan's trilogy didn't dig into the comic books it simply dug into the Modern Age of Comic Books, especially Year 1, the Long Halloween, Knightfall and The Dark Knight Returns. These comics match our current cultural view of the Batman mythos but stuff like the Adam West Batman were just as representative of Batman comics from the Silver Age.> stuff like the Adam West Batman were just as representative of Batman comics from the Silver Age."
"The Adam West Batman was, indeed, representative of the comics at the time (broadly, anyway). They were NOT representative of the comics at the time Tim Burton's Batman was made.It was in a way actually..."
"Ill try to keep this short as possible (Batman's history is surprisingly detailed) but the Bronze Age initially brought Batman back to the darker themes and lonewolf status. This started around 1970ish. Robin was shipped off to university, all the wacky gadgets were dispensed with, the Joker became a homocidal maniac again etc. However, as the 1980's rolled over Batman started slipping back into a pseudo-camp reminiscent of the silver age mixed with the darker themes. The early 80's is where the Vicki Vale/Selina Kyle romance plotlines really started up, a new Robin was introduced etc. This continued until Miller introduced TDKR and modern day Batman we know and love was cemented more or less."
"Burton's Batman's were a little late to the scene, 3 years after the Modern Age had begun, however, they emulated that late Bronze Age Batman quite effectively. You can also see a bit of The Killing Joke in Burton's Joker but his influences for Batman/Gotham and Vicki Vale seem to fit the era that had just ended.Okay, that's neat trivia and all, but I don't see how it's acting as a direct response to the things I said. I just don't know why you're writing it, and as such I don't really know what sort of response you were expecting.Your reading comprehension sucks.You specifically said Burton's movies were not representative of the comics at the time. I'm saying they were but 3 years late for the comic era they represented. Not ever?  Because he *has* reconfronted Joe Chill multiple times over the years.  The first time they did it Joe Chill ran away terrified and was about to tell his fellow mobsters who Batman was, but they killed him first when they found out he was responsible for creating him.  [They even recreated the scene in an episode of The Brave and the Bold (although with some differences)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUnljdse5Q)"
"The second time around Batman teams up with Joe Chill, and ends up with a gun pointed to him, but the character they teamed up to catch, The Reaper, shoots Chill first."
"In a more modern take, Batman had been stalking Chill for a month before giving him the gun that he used to shoot his parents, which still had 1 bullet in it, and it's implied that Chill understands and takes his life with it.Yes, never. All those retellings/reboots/retcons are bad and should feel bad."
"The fact that it was any random nobody street thug, not some supervillain or master criminal, who took Bruce's parents is important to the whole mythology of what creates and drives him."
"He *was* a nobody in some of those cases.  In others he wasn't.  But aside from Year Two, they were all part of Batman's canon story.  You don't get to get angry as a nerd about them getting their facts wrong when you're just picking and choosing what you like yourself.  Those things happened.  The first one in particular was written by Batman's creator himself.  They don't just feel bad and go away  because you don't want them to exist.1. I absolutely have the right to get angry about anything I want. Tomorrow I might choose to be angry about kale."
"2. I also have the right to a strong opinion about what makes a particular character's motivations and psychology important and meaningful, no matter what has been done to that character over years by different writers."
"3. If we stuck to Bob Kane's vision of Batman we would have nothing of the Batman character that people love today. If Bob Kane had his way the campy 60s Batman would be the pinnacle of Batman portrayal. Bob Kane loved the 60s Batman and famously disowned Miller's The Dark Knight Returns."
"My point is that you're specifically angry over what they did in the movie being wrong and being something that not *supposed* to ever happen when it *has* happened even more times than the instances I mentioned.  You can have the right to whatever *feelings* on the character you want, that's not the issue at hand.  We also obviously *didn't* just stick with Bob Kane (and I was talking about Bill Finger who is credited with writing that story), but multiple other popular writers as recent as Grant Morrison back in 2008 decided that they *did* like Batman getting closure with Chill."
"My point is not on what you personally *like* to focus on about Batman as a character, and what stories you don't like, but what you posit as being factually incorrect to the point of making you nerd-ragey because they got it wrong in the movie.  It isn't wrong, you just don't like it.  Which is fine, you can have whatever *opinion* you like, but it doesn't change anything.> but what you posit as being factually incorrect to the point of making you nerd-ragey because they got it wrong in the movie. It isn't wrong, you just don't like it."
"That is almost literally what nerd-ragey means. It means getting angry about trivial bullshit that only a nerd would get angry about and most people don't give a shit about."
"The sad part is, you're going to come away from this thinking righteously that you're being downvoted because people can't deal with your nerd rage, rather than because you're having trouble distinguishing it has never been part of the comics from it has sometimes been a part of the comics but it's not my favorite interpretation.Wow, I now have much more respect for The Brave and the Bold now. It was always too light-hearted Golden-age for me.Which take has Chill's suicide? That shit sounds awesome.[Batman 673 - Joe Chill in Hell.](http://www.comicvine.com/batman-673-joe-chill-in-hell/4000-122114/)"
"My worry is that future actors will try to imitate what he did, rather than finding something new to it. I really like what he captured, but there's other aspects still there.If they do decide to try Joker again in the future then I would love to see Mark Hamills joker come on screen. After playing the batman games (particularly arkham asylum) he really brings out the essence of the comic book joker.He did a great job keeping the dark side, but taking it in another direction. He'd need to lose some weight, though.He's actually not too bad now, since he lost weight for Star Wars.I think the problem with Hamill as a live action joker is that his voice will always be associated with the cartoon and video game Jokers. And translating the craziness of those jokers to live action would be next to impossible to do and do it justice.I think Hamill could do a great job, but just doesn't look the part. It would have to be some sort of full motion-capture type thing to re-create him to look the part as well as he acts the part.I sincerely hope that no one tries that, using the rationale that you can't better the Heath Ledger performance any other way. I always had a very hard time recognizing it was Heath under all of that makeup and prosthesis, but damn, that first picture really shows it.Yeah that picture made me realize that one of the reasons he's so hard to recognize is that he actually pinches his face into this specific joker expression when he's in character. The first photo shows his out of character look and it's completely different and suddenly becomes obvious it's heath. The point when Batman locks the door when Gordon tries to get in was so intense. It was a turning point for Batman, because you see the Joker has finally gotten inside Batman's head and it makes him indulge in the insanity.I can really imagine people looking at the first pic as First look at Heath Ledger as the Joker and crying out at the bad make-up and bad role choice. Thats why I think the outrage for Ben Affleck was made far too early.damn it, you're right"
"People did cry about Heath Ledger when he was first announced for the role.  They were skeptical if such a young actor could capture the essence of the Joker.  And yes, they were comparing Heath to Jack Nicholson's Joker, that's how skeptical they were at that point."
"Needless to say, once the trailer came out, all the nay sayers were quiet.I see this scene as being on par with the scene in Heat where [Pacino has coffee with De Niro](http://youtu.be/5gyfIvMd4T0?t=30s).[deleted]Dr Niro is good at what he does. He just doesn't want to be doing it forever. But at the same time he doesn't know how to get out.Such a brilliant scene. All one take, too. Not the first take, take 11 as I recall, but still. You're watching them act and react to each other live.Chris has actually admitted to taking inspiration from heat, especially in the prologue heist.Although the inspiration was obvious, the scene was still very original and felt new. The addition of William Fichtner (also in Heat) added a lot, too. * [Bytes taken from Christopher Nolan interview on Hero Complex](http://herocomplex.latimes.com/uncategorized/christopher-n-1/)"
"* Photos I've been collecting over the years, sorry no source"
"EDIT: Just realized it should be accompanied **by**. My grammatical mistake!And it's also definitely not bytes.Easily the best joker and batman scene pretty much ever imo. [Favorite pic from the album.](http://i.imgur.com/CrWPfY2.jpg)Love the socks.It's the pants, isn't it?"
"the socksDat ass.He got buns, Hun.Oh my God, Becky"

"ButtI feel like I need to rewatch the dark knight nowReally one of the best scenes, in any movie, in a long time. Say what you want but The Dark Knight was/is one of the best superhero movies ever. Just straight up great. I still remember seeing it at the midnight showing. Brilliant. Heath owned the role so much, and even if he was alive my feelings would be the same. He was The Joker, no if/and/buts about it...a really great fucking film. That's not saying a lot. The Dark Knight is incredibly boring, almost as illogical as its sequel, wears a sheen of darkness that seems to most people I know to represent intelligence and realism but mostly shades the lackluster characters that seemingly have no other motivation than to appear in the next scene."
"Joker's performance *is* great, though."
"Can't wait to get down voted for having a dissenting opinion.I mostly agree with you. its a fantastic movie, when the jokers on screen. otherwise its quite boring, like the other two in the trilogy.The Dark Knight Rises was quite bad but did have great moments but the other moments were quite really...bad. same like amazing spider man 2. hate the movie but so many good movies...its a shame. but The Dark Knight, imo, its wonderful. IMO rises wasn't bad, but I felt like it followed the lead of Batman Begins. begins and Rises felt truly in Gotham City, Dark Knight did not feel much like the other Batman movies. Gotham felt much closer to the real world which made it all the more terrifying in some aspects.I feel almost the same way as you. Get ready for down votes though. But don't expect anyone to tell you why it wasn't boring. Apparently not thinking Nolan is the greatest filmmaker alive today is breaking Reddiquitte.yeah, I really was disappointed with the whole trilogy. and I expected the downvotes, reddit loves nolan. I know this is an unpopular opinion but honestly I kinda hate the scene. Part of my issue is Christian Bale's often mocked Batman voice, which just becomes absolutely silly in this scene, for me."
"I didn't want to laugh when I saw this in theaters, but I did, and I wasn't alone. All of the drama gets sucked out the second Batman goes full on Cookie Monster, and it just feels like it ruins the scene."
"I had similar issues with the third film, though the issues were far... far greater there since I couldn't take Bane seriously either when he sounds like Sean Connery off of SNL's Celebrity Jeopardy bits."
"It feels like... watching some really well written dramas, but for some reason the cast have decided to do silly voices.>  Say what you want but The Dark Knight was/is one of the best superhero movies ever."
"Who says otherwise?SupermanHe's so white bread, who cares what he says.Lois Lane and Lex Luthor, I guess...I always thought of it as one of the best crime movies in recent memory and not the best comic book movie. It seems to be much more about crime and escalation than the comic book superhero. I'd give Spiderman 2 or Captain America: The Winter Soldier the nod for best superhero movie, though The Dark Knight is a better movie than those two.Winter Soldier was very good. I never liked the Sam Raimi spiderman movies, i know i know...hate me.....but yeah just couldn't do them. Far better then the new ones. I loved 500 Days of Summer but you really can't see any of Webb's vision in the new movies because Sony has too much control. That's what I loved about three Rami films. So many memorable moments.I think it really was a great film, not just a superhero movie like others.  I mean for example, I loved Guardians of the Galaxy, but it wasn't exactly a *brilliant* film.  I mean, it's was great more so in the way a good comedy is great.What made it a great film?It's the best of a certain *type* of comic book movie. The type inspired by the Frank Miller vision of utter endless bleak darkness. Which is not to invalidate it, because it is a very good film, but don't fall prey to the same sin the Academy always does, that serious films are inherently better than lighter ones."
"I think it deserves the praise as THE best comic book inspired movie. At this point, people no longer pidgeon hole it to strictly the criteria of super hero movies and I genuinely hope DC can replicate something like this. I was always hoping they would take the risk and hire Alfonso Cuaron for the justice league movie. His love for meticulous background choreographed chaos coupled with oners would have fit the gritty virtuoso style he exhibited in Children of men. I would watch a movie where superman is zipping through buildings above while we are at street level docu-style chaos with batman. One can dream.They are able to stop it up by FIVE and still make it look perfect?"
"Fuck.What does this mean?Heath ledger as the joker is one of my favorite performances ever.  Can someone explain this for me, please?"
"**Wally overexposed like five stops**, I want to say, and then **printed it down to bring some of the color back in**. But it's this incredibly intense overhead light which let us move in any direction. We had a handheld camera and shot however we wanted, be very spontaneous."
"1. What effect would that have had compared to just exposing normally?"
"2. What does printed it down mean?Over exposing it would make the image really bright and would cause some of the detail in light areas to drop off. Printing it down, or darkening it in post production would add a level of grit that otherwise would not have been there. Overall it should add a bit more contrast than a normal exposure."
"It also could generate a scene that is off *just enough* to be subconsciously noticed. You know something is off but can't quite put your finger on it. In a scene like this that can be a powerful effect.I believe overexposing the film to that extent gives that washed-out look. That, coupled with the harsh overhead lighting, really emphasizes the grittiness of the interrogation. They don't have to worry about clipping because it wasn't shot digitally (Nolan and Pfister prefer film)."
"Printing it down means they underexposed the film when they develop and color time in post so it wouldn't be blown out (since it was overexposed so much)."
"Don't quote me though, I've never gotten a chance to work with film as a medium; I've only shot digitally. This is just coming from a cinematography class I took in the spring.It really shows how important makeup, costume, lighting, editing, and camera work are to the scene as a whole. The stills just seem so different from the actual final product. It doesn't matter how good of an actor Heath Ledger is, with a shitty makeup or costume job, or the wrong lighting, it would have looked ridiculous. These guys don't get enough credit.It might be a bit weird, but this movie, and this scene, was a revelation for me. I felt watching this movie and Heath Ledger, especially in this scene, the exact way that so many people describe when they saw Marlon Brando in *A Streetcar Named Desire*. It flicked a switch in my mind. It's after I saw this that I really fell in love with movies.[deleted]It might be. Upholstery fabric looks great on film."
"It looks less great most other places, but in a controlled environment, you can make it look right. See also: David Tennant's Doctor Who long coat.It's electrostatically flocked parachute silk.No, I remember them having that discussion especially regarding scenes where he is on the bat pod. They feared it would get caught in the wheels but luckily, it fluttered.[deleted]Well probably, everything is modified to some extent to get a specific look. It's probably not a big adjustment though.A appearance/role by Ledger in TDKR would have most certainly helped the success of the movie. Oh what could have beenIt's amazing to me how good TDK was and how bad TDKR was. TDKR wasn't bad per say, it was just more of a comic book movie to TDK's crime movie."
"If that makes any sense Can you expand on this?Sure. Let's take The Dark Knight first. We really only have two comic book set pieces and that's the kidnapping of Lau and the chase scene. Let's remove those two and look at the remainder of the movie: A bank heist, a mafia meeting, legal procedure involving a RICO case, the mob striking back that involves the death of a police commissioner, a robbery/kidnapping attempt at a political fundraiser, an assassination attempt on the mayor, the disfigurement of the DA and some good old fashion terrorism. Probably because TDK deals with control, law, and order, this one feels like you could have switched out Batman and the Joker and with a few tweaks, had a similar movie like The Jackal or Die Hard 3."
"The Dark Knight Rises rises the stakes more because you have Bane's very long term plan coming to fruition that wipes out the Steelers and isolates Gotham. Bane traps the majority of the Gotham Police Department underground and now has a nuclear bomb driving around Gotham while participating in some societal reconstruction with the kangaroo courts. Additionally you have Gordon's Resistance Movement, the wall of cars and Bane's army of heavily armed guards and stolen Wayne Corp. vehicles..."
"The finale of The Dark Knight involves Batman defeating the Joker and Two Face one on one, plus or minus some dogs. The finale of The Dark Knight Rises involves a massive fight between the cops and inmates, Batman and Bane, and a nuclear weapon. TDK feels grounded in reality while TDKR has a larger, more grandiose and I would argue a more 'comic book' feel. Interesting, thanks. I was on the fence about some of your points, but I think you're spot on with that last paragraph. However, I'm not sure if that is a valid explanation for the quality of TDKR. I understand if you disagree, but I think TDKR was easily the worst in that trilogy. However, Batman Begins, as an origin story, was very much a comic book movie, as it was more outlandish and the storyline was much more comic book styled than anything seen in reality...but I feel the quality of the movie is much closer to TDK than TDKR.Oh, I totally agree TDKR is the weakest of the threeI think if The Joker was the villain in TDKR instead of TDK, it would have been the best movie ever.I disagree. What about the Bat-Joker relationship was there left to say after TDK? Sure, seeing Ledger chew scenery as the Joker would have been awesome, but we'd established and resolved the conflict between those two characters. We've got the rest of the Bat-franchise to show off what Ledger's Joker alluded to at the end of the film: He'll get out, cause some mayhem, and push Batman until he almost breaks, *which he never will.* If a follow-up film had Batman snap and kill the Joker, or [even lose control enough to severely injure him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0mHUlxWq7g), then Joker still wins. It would just reverse the point of TDK."
"Now, what I *would* have given a limb to see Ledger's Joker in Arkham, corrupting a young Dr. (Detective?) Harleen Quinzel in a mashup between *Mad Love* and *Silence of the Lambs.*joker taking over banes plan would be awesome.FOR YOUBane's plan would be of no interest to Joker; Joker would have a plan of his own.As the Joker loves chaos, he would have turned Banes plan on itself. After all, why would he destroy his playground that he and Batman fool around in? There's no fun in that."
"And Nolan's Bane wouldn't have worked with him for this reason, and would have either killed him or leave him locked in Arkham. It's been said before, but a scene showing Bane walk by the Joker's cell, looking at it, and waking away with the Joker laughing as he leaves would've been great. No CGI or actor needed. I think if Bane had come across Joker's cell he would probably have just killed him, recognising the danger he poses."
"Also, it was Blackgate prison that Bane busted open, not Arkham Asylum.Yeah, Arkham was essentially abandoned. I recall a while back though when the movie first came out, there was a script leak or something similar talking about the Joker being the only prisoner left in Arkham. I think you may be referring to [this fan-made storyboard](http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-where-the-joker-was-in-dark-knight-rises-2012-7). Yup. I was. Good detective work. I stand corrected. I don't think he would have been, not the main villain anyway.Him playing the judge instead of Cillian Murphy would have been great.If I recall they had the Scarecrow presiding over a kangaroo court like that in the comics at one point.uh, if heath was alive, there most likely would have been an entirely new story for the third installment. The joker wouldn't play along with bane like thatDon't think he would play along per se, but in a cut-off, isolated city of lunatics, I can see Heath's joker relishing the opportunity to be King of Psycho Island, regardless of the circumstances. I think I read here on reddit before TDKR came out a cool theory of how to include the Joker in the film even with Ledger passed away.."
"Basically it amounted to Bane walking through Arkham or Blackgate (whichever Joker would've been in in the Nolanverse) and telling his men to open each door as they pass. But as they come up to Joker's (obvious by the paint and laughter behind the door) Bane basically says Except that one. Leave it locked."
"I thought it was a neat little idea.oh shit, that would have been terrific. I keep thinking of this everytime I think of the dark knight risesLedger's Joker is the ultimate movie villain. It will never be topped.amazing how I see Heath in that first frame with the joker just sitting there but for all the other frames all I see is joker. I never realized how tense Jokers face muscles were the entire movie [Photo # 12](http://i.imgur.com/Z8hKn7S.jpg), for some reason, just stands out to me as iconic. I don't know that I've ever used that word before but when I got to that photo, that was how I felt about it. There, it's just two quintessential players in this game... on equal footing. Just having a chat, as it were."
"Yes, they're in an interrogation room and you'd think that gives one of them the upper hand but you can just tell that's not the case here. The look on Joker's face and his general demeanor - this is an absolutely great shot.Fun fact: People cared way more about the Joker than Batman.Batman is usually the least interesting character in his own stories.Heath really owned that role. Even in these stills you can see the character that he lived. I also really love how elemental this scene is. There is virtually nothing done with the lighting, and there is no soundtrack for the majority of it. And once some music does come in, it's basically just an [infinitely rising tone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rzIiF7LpPU). How awesome is that for helping to ramp-up the tension, eh?This is terrific.  It's posts like this that makes me visit reddit everyday because of some of the great subs such as this one."
"Through all the inane, juvenile and useless posts you see on this site, man, you guys shine.Best movie version of the Batsuit in my opinion. I revisit The Dark Knight every few months, definitely my favorite blockbuster all 4 of the leads (Oldman, Bale, Ledger and Eckhart) really hit a home run here. Ledger stands out as the best performance but many people overlook the others who were also incredible.The reason this is the best comic book movie ever is because it's not just a comic book movie, it's just simply a great movie. No other comic book film can say that, it's stuck in the genre. Honestly I could never seen Heath Ledger (like his actual face) in the joker because of how much he changed everything for the role, that first picture is literally the only time I can actually see him in the Joker.Really wish Nolan would do more commentaries.He was devastated by Heaths death, like Christian Bale. Really does not want to speak about the matter. I mean, he hardly ever does commentaries, for any of his movies. And I would love to hear more from him. I loved this! I don't know if I have ever read anything so I depth from the director about one particular scene. Where can I find more interviews with Nolan on his batman films?Not to sound like a smartass, but I just usually google Christopher Nolan and interview. He's one of the few guys out there that never gives a bad (or at least uninteresting) interview."
"EDIT: A wordDamn."
"That is some seriously powerful stuff."
"Thanks for sharing it.It's the most important scene in the film and the one that most establishes why The Joker is something Batman can't deal with effectively. The most telling phrase is when Heath says You have NOTHING to threaten me with. And Batman doesn't, because unlike any other villain, he can't just beat the shit out of him to get information. The Joker doesn't care if you beat him, and he doesn't care if you kill him. His greatest victory would be forcing Batman to kill him. Batman has literally nothing the Joker wants, so there's nothing to bargain. You have nothing to do with all of your strength"
"I've always loved that line so much, it's the point where it was clear the joker won that round, it's similar to me to sonny in a Bronx tale now yous can't leave, that's it he's got the upper hand  I would love to see heath ledger audition tapesI specifically remember seeing Dark Knight in the theaters with a couple of my friends, and in the opening act when Ledger reveals himself to be the Joker underneath the mask,  I could hear my friend terrifyingly whisper,  that's not Heath Ledger...Posts like this are why i love r/movies.  Lots of good insight into an amazing film.[deleted][deleted]This last photo is just funny, because it somewhat looks like the Joker is trying to take a poop.my only wish is that, I hope one day comic book movies become this good. I dont care how much money these movies make, I find them to be nothing but shit."
"This trilogy. Oh should i say this scene alone is better than any comic book ever made."
"I am not saying they should go this dark, but they should at least stop all this pg shit, and corny villains and give a good unpredictable movie."
"The first time I watched this movie. I had no idea how it would end. Its obvious batman would win, but how.....Was he ever not in character?"
"I never noticed how long The Joker's finger nails were until that pic of him pointing at Batman.I always wondered why they didn't remove Joker's makeup and put him into a jumpsuit in booking.Does anyone else love Heath's socks?My God, look at Heath Ledger's fingernails. Such a subtle yet telling indication that he gave himself over entirely to the role.Can we talk about how awesome the Joker's outfit is? Super snazzy; I might have to suit up.My favorite movie, movie scene of all time.Would have been great to hear Nolan give props to Alan Moore for the original idea of this scene. The Killing Joke was a great story.Impotent strength. Such a great oxymoron I loved the way that the Batman actually listened to the Joker's speech about the true nature of humanity as he saw it.  It was like he was turning it over in his mind, almost convinced that he was hearing the truth for the first time.  An amazing scene from my favorite movie.  Thanks for this.  Heath Ledger played that part better than anybody ever could. That is the greatest character and acting of all time.Christian bale will always be the real batman.This just makes me happy and sad at once.  What a magnum opus.  What a swan song.  RIP, Heath.Breathtakingly good photographs. Such a massive loss. Why couldn't Christopher Nolan have directed the new Ninja Turtles movie? :(WHERES RAHCHELGreatest film ever made.This is essential for film majors. Great post OP!Pfister just lit the scene with the desk lamp and nothing else."
"Horse shit. I recreated this scene in a lighting class in film school and spent hours studying it. No way that was lit with just the desk lamp. For starters, that's just not the angle the light's playing on Ledger's face. Still don't believe me? Look at the lamp itself, you can see it's not only illuminated (from the same source as what's on Ledger) but you can see the fucking specular reflection! Related: how the hell do you recover that much highlight detail from a *five* stops overexposere (after the lights come up)? That's *insane*! (what were they shooting with/on?)I doubt it was five stops. Even whomever was being interviewed said that was questionable."
"Though it's possible. No idea what stock they were using, and we know he pulled it some in developingthe first time i saw this scene, i was sitting at the edge of my seat, biting my nails with tension as if Christian would tear down Heath with absolute rage. It was a very real scene. Truly gripping moment which gets under your skin. Heath could not have played the Joker any better than this...  Nolan accomplished his mission of getting under the audience's skin with his version of the Joker. My absolute respect to the man who immortalized the Joker.It's odd - I've never thought this while watching the film, but seeing stills like that, make Bale's Batman seem a bit...small.Never really noticed how ugly that Bat-suit is before.This scene is exactly what it's like dealing with my 4 year old every daythis is amazingFull apple box = short people2x apple box = Tom Cruise. On the sixteenth picture Nolan mentions camera drift.  Can someone please explain this technique to me?Instead of completing locking the camera off on a tripod (which would result in a completely static frame), it's handheld (or on a steadicam) but isn't actively moving or panning. The composition is still the same, but it  floats around just a little bit, putting the audience more in the scene. Some of my favorite characters and actors, with my favorite director explaining the shots of a favorite scene."
"Thanks for this.Awesome! I love Heath as the Joker!Thank you so much for posting this.I watched 10 Reasons I Hate You last night. I love Heath LedgerNow replace this scene with Ben Affleck...the setting and Ledger would be great but Batman...I dunno.*Never start with the head the victim gets all fuzzy.*"
"**BAM!**"
"..."
"*See?*What does he mean when he says the dop printed down the shot after overexposing it?Godamn I love the Dark KnightThanks for posting this, it is such an iconic scene and one of my favorites. Period.William?The last great movie villain. It's a shame there's so few memorable bad guys in movies these days.This is fan - fucking - tastic!Awesome movie, awesome performance from Heath Ledger.  Too bad his demons won  :(I laughed a little too hard at that last frame for some reason. Number eight needs to be a meme. Damn, it's been nearly 7 years since Ledger died.By far one of my favorite scenes in the movieHeath Ledger really made this movie (not literally)Such a heavy character, the Joker. Heath took it and became it. God that blessed actor,.that first picture is the only picture of Heath Ledger as the Joker that I have every actually recognized Heath Ledger. Its the perfect lighting and angle to actually look like Heath. Every other time I see him as the Joker I can't tell its him"
".What's amazing is how you see Heath in that first picture but see Joker in the other pictures. He really got that character down.My absolute favorite scene in the movie. Really exemplifies who The Joker is, and why he's such a great villain. Why he and Batman will never cease their conflict. I don't think there will ever be a better batman/joker on screen portrayal better than this one. This acting was astounding. The look and feel of the characters was beyond my ideas of what the character should be. Sadly Heath ledger did such an amazing job it overshadowed ekharts portrayal of dent, who could have easily won a best supporting actor title as we'll.How is it that someone as focused and committed as Christopher Nolan is to filmmaking can make movies with such incredibly terrible plotholes (see *Dark Knight Rises, The*)? It's a damn shame. Heath's acting saved The Dark Knight, but there was nothing so redeeming in TDKR to make it more than a giant eyeroll of a film. There's suspension of disbelief, and then there's abandoning all logic and just piecing together cool scenes that sort of flow into a narrative. At least Inception covered its tracks well enough to not make it noticeable.I do wonder what bales reaction was the first time he saw the joker makeup. I hope they didn't spoil it before hand by showing the concept sketches.Great, now I have this irresistible urge to go watch the Dark Knight. Thanks OPIts amazing how he looks just like himself in the makeup (in the first img) but when he gets into character its a completely different person.Jesus, 5 stops over exposed??? I like Wally as a cinematographer but that takes some balls to shoot in that way.This scene always stuck out for me for a reason they only alluded to: This wasn't the only time we see Batman in full light, but it's by far the longest. This was as much a test of Batman as it was of The Joker. It showed that he was more concerned with what's-her-name's safety than his own stealthiness. By doing this he opened himself up to the Joker in a way that never happened at any other point in the trilogy. It showed how the Joker was actually in control of everything that happened in this scene, and, by extension, everything in Batman's life, because he was the Yin to Batman's Yang. The trilogy peaked with The Dark Knight, and this scene is really where everything came together. If using hoverzoom, or Imagus or similar, scrolling between 10 and 11 is kind of captures the two characters and their relationship perfectly, and is really satisfying.Epic performance for sure.This is the first time I actually noticed Batman's cape in this movie.This movie will never get old to me.The thing that strikes me the most is how much this scene is the polar opposite of the Police Brutality scene in the comic book Transmetropolitan.  Spider Jerusalem get beaten to hell by the police, but does it with this look of smug supremacy because he knows that getting beaten by the Law means they're afraid of him."
"It's a great Yin/Yang moment to the power in this situation when you switch which side the protagonist is one.Awesome God Heath Ledger had such depth in this movie. Amazing. Well done! Heath died way to young! I feel he did die doing what he loved and in one of his best acting gigs ever.  Title says 32 on-set photos but I'm only counting 10. Am I missing something?"
"edit: Never mind, i'm an idiot.I can't believe its been 7 years since this movie came out.The only thing that bothered me about that scene is that the Joker is somehow able to take a (large police officer) hostage after the beating he received from Batman. He should have had a concussion at the very least.TIL filmmakers overanalyze their own work the way highschool english teachers overanalyze booksThis is pretty darn cool. I love seeing the inner workings of scenes like this. So many little things that were conscious decisions that I wasn't aware oflbitcoin for everyone! /o/"
"http://moonbit.co.in/?ref=f2c0143b3895why the hell wasnt this on the bluray special featuresHe just wasn't big enough.  Another inch or two and 40 more pounds of pure muscle and I'd be convinced.I still think Ledger's Joker is the greatest villian character in movie history and just might be the greatest character ever. To bad the best joker died :(The cape looks really stupid when Batman is sitting in a chair. I've never seen it from that angle. I love shots like these though. Thanks!"
"The chairs looks bolted down, but aren't. Great read!Any way to get these pics in a wallpaper format?batman is some real serious cinema ; ^ )I know I'll probably get downvoted for saying it, but I like Mark Hamill's voiceovers(Arkham games, animated series) more than Heath Ledger's live action. (Not to say that Heath's performance wasn't spectacular, it was)The make up for The Joker was so good that you could barely tell it was Heath Ledger. But in those first two shots, the first one especially, for some reason I can see Heath more than I ever have. Thanks for sharing, one of my favorite movies and roles of all time.Same here. Found myself thinking Ah there's Heath.I really miss Heath Ledger. His death was very impactful at that time in my life. He deserved to reap the love he earned.are these really on-set photos? they just look like stills from the actual scene, maybe just taken from the other cameras that were filming. I imagine they were taken by the stills photographer. It would have been better if they could have touched on the same kind of scene in a sequel, but where Batman handles it the right way instead of using violence.Omg I loved heath ledger! I miss seeing him in New moviesAs spectacular Ledger's performance was in the film, you can't deny that's thanks to the writer and director of the film. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2yv8aT0UFcVery cool study in the scene...Great images and quotes. Thanks for this. Seeing these photos remind me that the weakest part of Nolan's Batman movies was the character of Batman himself. As much as I loved all three movies, they were really carried by the excellent villains and supporting cast. I think these photos just highlight how Bale is not an imposing or intimidating figure--he literally just looks like a guy in a silly suit rather than the force of nature that Batman is supposed to be. It's because they're Bruce Wayne movies, not Batman movies.I just hate Nolan's take on Batman :/ I appreciate what he was going for, it's just not for me in the slightest.Great content. You are definitely one of the most valuable Reddit accounts.This was one of those iconic movie scenes that will be shown forever. I never realized just how important this scene is. What a great film!Did Ledger finish this movie or did he die before his scenes were complete?[He almost finished his next film too.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1054606/?ref_=ttfc_fc_tt)"
"They managed to tie it up with Jude Law and Johnny Depp in a fantastic way. If you're a Ledger fan you should really see this one. Fantastic!finished itThere was a specific line from the comics I really wish had been in the movie.  Still a great scene."
">You had a bad day once, am I right? I know I am. I can tell. You had a bad day and everything changed."
"For the whole quote, which is a bit too long for the movie, here is a link.  4th bullet under The Killing Joke."
"http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_JokerMakes me want to watch the movie.One of the only 'adult' comic book movies ever made. I am so sick of movies like 'Guardians of the Galaxy'.  I wonder if we will ever see a comic book movie made strictly for adults again.to be fair if they did a lighthearted comic in a really gritty/realistic way it would risk betraying the fanbase that's excited for the movie in the first place. I think both the Dark Knight and Guardians of the Galaxy perfectly achieved the tone that was representative of the respective comicsThe most overrated movie ever..It was a good movie. That's it. I fail to see where it is the top 10 or even top 100 movies of all times and I hate the circlejerk that is constantly surrounding this movie and specifically Heath Ledger. He did a really good job sure but the reaction that this is the best performance of ever for all time!!!!!!!!!!! is silly and has been beaten to death.The most trolled comment ever.If it isn't the most overrated, it's right up there.  I honestly don't get what people saw in it, it's got no soul, terrible interpretations of the characters, gaps in logic, pitiful action scenes,, etc.He had it planned so perfectly how to escape.  Too perfectly, to the point where it didn't even make sense.  A lot of holes in that movie.  It's said many times that the joker and Batman are equally as powerful as each other, but in different ways. Joker represents what Batman could've become had he chose to (all the villans are)."
"He was truly a super villan, and stunningly intelligent, I don't count that as a plot hole.Anybody else incredibly sick of hearing about this movie?  It's not the end all be all movie that it is made out to be.But but but... he died so that makes this the best movie ever!!!!!"
"To be fair, if you're 13 years old this may in fact be the best movie you've ever seen, but I'm just tired of hearing about it.I just came reading the headline.I'm obsessed with Joker, Heath and that movie. Thanks for posting this!"
"a[I guess the look I'm best known for is Black Steel.](http://i.imgur.com/EUUIgZm.jpg)I love this movie but every time I see Batman punch the Jokers hand on the table it's so corny it takes me right out of the movie. I'll be honest, I didn;t like the Joker in the Dark Knight. They basically made him omnipotent. He has time to hire mental patients and criminals as his henchmen,  get one arrested with a bomb sown in his stomach set to go of at the right time as he's being interrogated. ETC ETC."
"He's the opposite of chaos, he had the most organized and  punctual organization in all of gotham.But the lisp and unreal growl in Batman's voice, does that not irk anyone else? And the women who played Rachel, I'm the only one who cringed when they appeared?"
"Eh, I'll get downvoted to oblivion.I loved how Batman tends to appear out of thin air in closed rooms in those movies. This is the greatest super hero movie ever. No other Joker will ever compare, the role actually killed the actor.The way reddit sucks this movie's dick is nauseating. > On the set, we shot it fairly early on. It was actually one of the first things that Heath had to do as the Joker."
"Does anybody know what was chronologically the first scene that Heath shot in this film? Or else, the first few? I'd love to re-watch the movie and observe how the character developed.Now, the important thing to remember, guys, is that Batman has never studied criminology or psychology or anything like that.  He's basically just a rich thug.  I think if he just acts like an idiot and loses his temper here it'll really sell who Batman is, and what his relationship with the Joker is, got it?Heath Ledger's Joker - The original duck face. Meme material all aroundI only saw maybe 6 or 8 pictures. Do I not know how to properly use imgur? This is a serious question.At the bottom, it'll say load more images or something.thank youThis makes me even more sad about the fact that there was never any conclusion between these two.Can someone explain the purpose of the set photographer?These movies are amazing, the last one of the trilogy is my favourite /r/moviescirclejerk I wonder if anyone in the Gotham PD raised any concerns over the fact that they had a guy dressed as a bat interrogating a clown.I loved Heath Ledger as the Joker....but I hated that scene. It just seemed so un-Batman for Batman to be interrogating a criminal. I just couldn't let myself enjoy the scene because I kept thinking how implausible it was for a guy to be sitting around doing police stuff in a batsuit. Driving around in the Batmobile, kickin bad guy ass; yeah, sure.  Hanging out in the pricinct....not as much. What next? Batman drinking bad coffee and filling out paperwork? /r/moviescirclejerkOh look, an article about TDK and Heath Ledger in /r/movies.  Astonishing.A man dressed as SWAT Dracula interrogating a crown. Highest Cinema.Reading the descriptions, this scene feels very much like an allegory for America (Batman) fighting terrorism/extremism/al-qaeda (The Joker). Am I the only person on the planet who can't stand this movie? I love Batman but I don't get all the love for this movie. Not to start an argument or anything here. You have to remember in the 2005-2008 Span aside from Batman, the only comic book movies we got were 300, Watchmen, Catwoman, and Constantine, and they weren't really big blockbusters outside of Watchmen and 300. Batman Begins came out in 2005, and we hadn't had a batman movie since Batman in Robin in 1997, and no one was really making comic book movies. The first Batman was groundbreaking in that Nolan delivered a very real and believable Bruce Wayne/Gotham and there wasn't anything quite like it. Come 2007-2008 was when Marvel Started their Phase 1, and The Dark Knight came out, and we began seeing a LOT more comic book movies coming out*sigh*"
"HL's acting was pretentious and overrated."
"go ahead and crucify meIt's a shame that all this lesson the Joker taught Batman was somehow lost. When Bats faced Bane, another foe who didn't care for his life and was willing to die in the explosion, all Batman was able to do was punch him for the information.[more view](http://wgkrs.com/RlvdTE)one of my all time favs"
"RIP in peace keith...rip in peacethose ears and cape should go...make batman more adult and it can work...might not be able to sell as much merchandize doeI know I'm going to be downvoted but"
"Everything Nolan is saying makes it clear that he doesn't really have much of a vision. It's obvious he's making all of that up on the spot because someone is taking it down and most of it is just regurgitating what his crew tells him. Nothing he said reveals anything about the way he directs, his intent as a director or how the actors responded to his directing. It's just what he sees in that room. Made even more evident with the last line I haven't thought this through before wtf, why the fuck not? jesus christ, where is your prep time going, Nolan?Well, he has to walk a line between over- and under-directing."
"He wanted to leave room for the actors to express their interpretation of the role, and he wanted to leave room for the experienced crew to suggest things. He probably had a good notion of the scene going from low-lit maybe slightly cliche cop-interrogation into the Batman stuff, but then the lighting guy is like We'll do it like this and why would Nolan argue with that?"
"Then there's the point of the scene:"
"We wanted it to be the point at which Batman is truly tested by the Joker and you see that the Joker is truly capable of getting under everybody's skin."
"As he says, it's a central set piece that they wanted to get right - whilst writing. That is they wanted the dialogue and the actions (such as were writeable) to reflect this notion of Batman losing control - hence his (and Gordon's) controlled start."
"By the end it's the Joker who's the one in control and Batman has - more or less - been defeated."
"The Joker's MO is more or less to set himself up to control the lives of others. To push their boundaries and break them. Which is why he is defeated at the end, when the boat-dudes wont break."
"What Nolan was talking about when he said he hadn't really thought it through before, was the fact that the scene encompasses all the elements he finds most interesting in film making, not that he hadn't really considered what the scene meant other than Huh, Batman beats up Joker, duuurrrrr."
"He was probably slightly too busy at the time to sit down for 10 minutes and reflect on what that scene had required and contained on a technical and storytelling level."
"As for his direction with the film and this scene, Nolan talks about themes for the film, for the scene. The contrast between Gordon and Batman, the shift between Batman and The Joker. He mentions how the lighting affects the feel of the scene. He talks about what he wanted to scene to signal with regards to both The Joker and Batman characters."
"So all in all I'd say he talks quite a bit about his vision.I swear I must be the only one on this planet that thinks Heath Ledger was a terrible Joker and that Christian Bale was an awful Batman. My Joker will always be Nicholson but I don't care much for these uber gritty portrayals. Give me a good Prince song and a chance to deface some art over this scene any day."
"Why so serious, indeed.Jack Nicholson was better.  Cesar Romero was better.right...and who won an academy award ?jack was not even close to heath's performance as the joker. It's not really fair to compare them They both fit the tone and feel perfectly in their respective movies. Meh, Nicholson was just Nicholson. Ledger actually became the Joker of the comics I loved. Nicholson wasn't bad per se, but I never was lost in his performance. Ledger became a different person onscreen. In your opinion.Heath's portrayal of the joker is SHEER BRILLIANCE.  Course, you guys know that.My god Batman's mask looks ridiculous."
"Hey /u/Join_You_In_The_Sun,"
"This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.I'm a big, tough guy (I know the internets, we all are) but that scene really did hit home with me. What DO you do when all your physical and moral strength is ultimately futile?Having watched other Heath Ledger films, I don't believe they used his voice in The Dark Knight. It sounds nothing like him, it doesn't even sound like a synthesizer or anything was used. People are so impressed over his performance, but I think they were fooled completely. Whoever did the Joker's voice in that movie was a professionally trained voice actor.Nope.  That was all Heath.Compare the Joker's voice to all the other roles Heath has done. He cannot manipulate his voice like that. He couldn't even do a proper Western American accent in Brokeback. I watched Doctor Parnassus or something like that, and his voice was a deep, broguish Aussie accent."
"People have been bamboozled. That wasn't his voice. I've noticed that there seems to be a conspicuous lack of behind the scenes footage involving him too. I wonder why?There has been much written about how Ledger holed himself up in a hotel preparing for the role.  He has spoken in interviews about how part of that preparation was the voice and the laugh.  There is nothing I can offer to convince you if you don't believe it.  We will just have to disagree.  I would wonder, however, that if someone else had contributed to such an iconic piece of movie history, they would have demanded some recognition and made it known publicly that they provided that voice. No one has taken credit.  I think this supports that Heath alone was the voice of the Joker."
"It's called a non-disclosure agreement."
"One theory I've had is that it was Gary Oldman. It makes sense.One of the most overrated performances in film history. That's just how I feel about it.Am I the only one here who doesnt give a shit and is bothered that this is in the front page?"

Android devices at the time.It was Queen or the theme to Ghostbusters for a solid 10 years.And [sometimes](https://youtu.be/7fIrajum1DA?t=36s) it felt like those overlappedWow that was rough. Instead of getting braces Freddy just had them hire a kid with fucked up teeth too. Brilliant.Let's not forget Bon Jovi."
"It's impossible, I've tried. Mr. Bovine Joni himselfGod damn it, I just finished a run through of that show. Don't make me start again.I think you mean Jon bon jovi..."
"That's what I said! Bovine Jovi!Ah but I think you're halfway there. Living on a chairTake my karmaAnd make it my flair-airWhoa-OH!Living on a Chaaa-IIR!!That was pretty good guys. Bravo!If you haven't seen it watch ESPN's 30 for 30 Small Potatoes. It's about the failed USFL and how Trump basically destroyed that league in an attempt to springboard into the NFL. Worth the watch as are all of the 30 for 30 series which is on Netflix. > 30 for 30 Small Potatoes"
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luZNCMkdTeEThis is insane, everything is like 1.5 times the normal speed. WTF?People have been speeding up/slowing down certain shows, and songs to avoid Copyright detection.Most likely to get around YouTube copy right detection Yep, really cemented it for me as to what kind of character Trump really has.30 for 30s are the bestMy favorite has been the Bo Jackson one. I had no idea the buccineers ruined his last season of college baseball. I'm from Alabama, and the Bo Jackson 30 for 30 is one of the best things I've ever watched.That one was incredible. One of the greatest, if not the greatest, athletes of all time. My mom went to college with him, one day she was rounding a corner in the hall and ran straight into him. Instantly knocked to the ground.My mom was at Auburn when he was too. Hello brother....and that's how I met your mother...Off topic: Pony Excess is amazing. That is the one about SMU and basically every school in that conference was cheating. The Marcus Dupree one is the best one I've seen still.As someone who has lived in Miami almost all his life The U is my favorite but the dupree 30 for 30 is my 2nd  favorite for sure.Wasn't that the one where the former announcer for the Generals called him out for destroying the league and, when asked about it, Trump responded by saying he would (legally, not physically) attack him?Can we take a second to appreciate [this mullet](http://i.imgur.com/cvYTR2h.png)?That thing should be in a museum!His beard looks like the sort of beard you get when customising a video game character.Is there such a thing as a clip-on beard?A lot of dudes are getting beard implants now, so kinda.http://imgur.com/6nD3vamI wish I could think of names as awesome as /u/CaptainFartdickYou'll never be that cool. Sorry.http://gfycat.com/IdolizedHauntingKusimansehttp://i.imgur.com/92LFUyN.jpg?1http://gfycat.com/AlienatedFinishedBluebirdThe story of how a rich man managed to go bankrupt RUNNING A FUCKING CASINO.> a fucking casino"
"Notice how casinos are mainly *cash* businesses? That means its easy to just not report income simply by taking the cash and putting in your pocket instead of in the ledger. This way you can make it look like you're losing a ton of money every year. But why would you want it to look like you're insolvent? So then you can claim bankruptcy, stiff all the creditors you owe money to (or refinance with them), and dissolve the racket you were running legally. Bankruptcy isn't bad business, a lot of times its a windfall."
"Cmon man, haven't you ever sold drugs before? You need a guy that owns a restaurant or a pawn shop (any cash business) to square you up when the IRS starts snooping."
"Disclaimer edit: I have no idea if that is really what he did or not. This is a serious allegation. It is one thing to be a scheming creep and move money around to protect your wealth in a bankruptcy. What you are talking about is straight up fraud. I don't think I have heard anyone claim this is what Trump is doing.   What are you talking about. The way you launder money is you claim that your cash business took in more money then it really did making all the illegally got money now legal. This wouldn't make you look insolvent, it would actually make you look like you're doing very good because you're making a bunch of fake profit Exactly, now if you gave yourself a huge salary and massive massive bonuses and expense accounts...  then you could bankrupt it by giving all the money to yourself...Corporate bankruptcy doesn't work the same as an individual going bankrupt. Donald Trump uses bankruptcy as a loophole to either get rid of investments he's bored with or as a way to make more money."
"Bankruptcy is an admission of insolvency. It is, broadly speaking, protection against particular lawsuits claiming you aren't living up to your end of the deal by basically saying that you can't, because you have no money."
"Bankruptcy is complex and there's a lot of different laws and legal categories surrounding it but, simply put, Donald Trump stays rich because he manages to reliably separate his personal wealth from his corporate investments, so that when one of his companies goes under he takes as little a hit as possible."
"It should be obvious at this point that bankruptcy means nothing to him when he's still got money to burn."
"**[e]** grammar.It would be interesting, or entertaining at least, to hear Trump try to explain his corporate bankruptcies as something that actually shows how really really smart he is, but also such a straight-shooting, stand-up guy. I guess, it would go something like this:"
"*You see, these bankruptcy laws are there for a reason. They allow entrepreneurs like myself to keep on innovating and create new jobs instead of going down because of one mistake."
"Yes, I made mistakes! Everyone who tries to innovate is going to make mistakes. But because of bankruptcy laws, I was able to survive these mistakes and go on to create my incredibly successful businesses. Bankruptcy laws help keep the economy going, so, of course I'm going to use them. It stupid and un-American not to do so. Food stamps and welfare, on the other hand - they're just an invitation to sit on your ass and let the government babysit you.*"
"**DISCLAIMER FOR ANYONE READING THIS OUT OF CONTEXT:**"
"I strongly disagree with all of the above; I was merely trying to channel The Donald as accurately as possible."
"[deleted]What people say and how people feel do not necessarily align.He's not taking advantage of the system; he's 'business savvy'.You're being sarcastic right?Are there people who are business savants?This is a great analogy. Both systems are in place to protect the public. Both are meant to be used as a last resort. both systems can also be gamed for benefit. The big difference is the amount of money. The wealthy have found ways to make bankruptcy very, very, very profitable.There was a decent writeup here a week or two ago explaining the difference between what normal people call bankruptcy and what the super rich call bankruptcy. Two vastly different things.Several years ago I saw an interview in which Trump stated, If you owe a bank $1000 and can't pay it back, you become a liability.  If you owe a bank $100 million and can't pay it back, you become a partner.[The now former Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis said something similiar a couple years ago to a interviewer.](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/the-greek-warrior)"
">A few years ago, Varoufakis told Yorgos Avgeropoulos, a documentary filmmaker, that the difference between a debt of ten thousand euros and one of three hundred billion euros is that only the latter gives you negotiating power. And it does so only under one condition: You must be prepared to say no."
"This being in the context while he was a college professor and was being asked about the Euro Bailout at the time.'If someone owes you a thousand dollars, they're in trouble. If someone owes you ten thousand dollars, you're in trouble.'"
"Not Trump, but you reminded me of it.If someone owes me ten dollars, they've got a problem.  If someone owes me twenty dollars, I've got a problem."
"You just reminded me: I'm poor.Well it's actually that they were filing for different types of bankruptcy. There's different versions, so it's really not that rich/poor call them differently... but there are different types of bankruptcy, and most people just assume that means they're broke.Absolutely correct. It's all extremely confusing, but from what makes sense to me it basically all has to do with interest rates, allocating money and product to increase profits. In the business world it's quite common and quite an intelligent move that most businessmen fail to recognize when needs to be done."
"Oh and voodoo magic. I think that has something to do with it too.I think it's a vast oversimplification to say that declaring bankruptcy is a 'command and intelligent' move in the business world."
"It's not as shattering as an individual doing it, but it also informs the corporation's ability to get investment backer funding, loans, public trading, etc.I really don't need any more convincing that he's a scumbag.  but it looks kinda funny.Just out of interest, why is he a scumbag? he's built a large amount of wealth on the backs of undocumented workers, then turns around and talks how they are ruining out country.  Dude, you GAVE them jobs!  You are ruining the country by your own measure.  It's trump that kicks people out of their apartments to build gaudy looking, nice looking places that are actually multi story shit boxes.  It's trump that over leverages these projects, skims a bunch off the top and weasles away after the fact, giving up shares of now worthless companies in bankruptcy."
"Donald Trump is exclusively good at 1 thing. Making Donald Trump rich."
"He's not in the helping people business, he's not in the diplomacy business, he's not even in the war making business, he's the textbook definition of a Plutocrat."
"We don't want president trump to evict us, restructure our debt, and build a gaudy house of cards on top of our country.He's not even especially good at making Donald Trump rich, given what a leg up he got from his father and how much of his supposed wealth is leveraged.  If not for Frank Trump and his connections, Donald might be selling used cars in Hoboken.On top of it, he's just an all around rude, mean, self-centered person. If he disagrees with anyone or dislikes anyone, he calls them talentless and ugly. What kind of grown adult does that? He acts like he deserves everything because he's rich, including sex. When his (now ex) wife wouldn't have sex with him, he held her down and forced her to have sex with him. By definition it was rape, but due to gag orders (no pun intended) and numerous threats Trump has made to intimidate her, she can't say what really happened."
"He strong-arms and bullies anyone who says something mean about him in the media, even when it's completely true."
"He's made his living out of building businesses that were really good at fucking people over and earning himself a lot of money."
"He's garish and classless. Everything of his is gold plated because he thinks that having gold on everything is super cool because it shows everyone how rich he is."
"He's that kid from high school that had really rich, mostly absent parents, who spent too much time watching MTV so he had no sense of social norms. He never had parents around to tell him to quit being a prick, but they always had an high credit limit on his credit card to buy him nice clothes or a new car or a new watch. He was the kid who would show up at the party and try and take (never ask) some people's beer or tell them to pour out shots for everyone (or just steal a bottle), but never offered to return the favor or ever do a favor for friends. He felt he earned the money he had and no one should touch it, but everyone else should use their money to help him.He's basically C-Zar from Kroll Show all grown up. That's actually terrifying.We are pretty much listing attributes that make a person the worst type of human being.> Donald Trump is exclusively good at 1 thing. Making Donald Trump rich."
"With a lot of help from his father. When you start with million of dollars, a successful business, and lots of connections it's not that difficult to make a fortune, especially when all you care about is money. So many people don't even mention that his father was considered a real estate mogul, the difference was his father was doing it while NYC was declining, Donald mostly started to make money as it was increasing in the late 80s on."
"A friends grandfather worked with his father and said that Donald was an egotistical, pompous jackass even before he had money.he would have made more money had he just taken his inheritance, bought properties, and held onto them for a little while, doing nothing, selling them later.If Bush Junior managed to won twice,i really think USA people would elect a turtle with enough hype and advertising.A turtle you say? What are the key issues this turtle represents? I am all ears.Turtles do not have ears, so we'll need your support. [deleted]Google Mitch McConnellYou may not but people do. I know more people than not who have sworn to vote for him. Where do you live? Just curious because I feel like that is a pretty major variable."
"Edit: love changed to live. Retardville I am guessing.I live in Denver and my whole family loves him. But they are also openly racist, homophobic, and pretty much every other vile conservative stereotype. I have a family member who worked for Apple and one who worked foe Nasa and yet theyre still that way. Its really hard to teach people critical thinking skills when theyve been brainwashed to be a certain way their whole lives."
"Plus trump is always confident and assertive and people are fucking stupid, they just gravitate towards that.  Sometimes it makes me wonder if the problem with having a caste society is merely that its impossible to always distinguish the real humans from the might as well be chimpanzees. But those kinds of people seriously might as well be a different, less intelligent species."
"Edit - kids -> kinds> But those kids of people seriously might as well be a different, less intelligent species"
"Are you still referring to your family?It's wrong to differentiate the intelligent from the less than intelligent, just sayin. Things would probably run better in the world, but there are plenty of smart sociopaths that need to be as far away from power as possible. The same holds true for anyone of intelligence that has a superiority complex, such as yourself. People like that fuck things up and next thing you know forced sterilization and other craziness happens. We don't need that, thank you.How is it possible that a person like this can potentially be president of one of the most influent countries in the world? Serious question, i'm not American.Because the American political system is set up as a hybrid reality show and sports tournament.  It isn't about who will lead the country best, it's about picking sides, fighting the opposition, and selling entertainment."
"Trump is the Snooki of the American presidential race.It's not. He's taking up space in the papers, keeping the focus off Bush III.Plus it's 25 years old.  If I were judged on what I did 25 years ago, I'd never get hired.  He's done so much more dumb stuff since then that this is really unnecessary. Well our current president was judged on his actions since *birth* so...What was the Cosby doing more than 25 years ago? Oh yeah being a scum bag. So was Trump. He shits on the little guy and yet they love him. He planned on getting 40 year tax abatement plans from NYC on his buildings in the 80s. I'd say 25 years still applies. Everything he has now, is based on how much he took ,and took, and took...No, i think when you're trying to beckme the leader of an entire country then what you did 25 years ago is still pretty relevant.I probably had cleaner pants than Trump 25 years ago. And I was still shitting them.good point.  It's funny, this is the closest we've ever come, to electing a cartoon character president."
"reminds me of that black mirror episode.Why shouldn't he be? Clinton was judged on what he did during the draft. Kerry was judged on what he did after Vietnam.> Plus it's 25 years old."
"[Ok so how about one that's 4 years old?](http://m.imdb.com/title/tt1943873/)Bulldozing a house someone's still living in?  [Where have I heard of that before...](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZMoi-nDd6cQ/hqdefault.jpg)That line about what hell be doing for the environment; the fucking gall of that man is beyond belief. I shouldn't watch this, it won't be good for my blood pressure.> He's done so much more dumb stuff since then"
"Like running for President. I sincerely hope he gets the nomination.  Not just because he'll never win, but because I really want to see his epic rap battle used in campaign ads. I loathe Trump, but his multiple campaigns for President have not been dumb at all.  They aren't meant to genuinely attempt to put him in the White House, they're meant to boost his name / brand, and they mostly succeed very well at doing that.What I don't get is how much it conflicts with the general business wisdom that mixing politics only harms your brand with half of your potential customers. Has that gone out the window? His media personality was never really *Republican*. It was *rich dude that owns casinos and hotels* (yes I know that is usually Republican). Democrats watched his shows too. How is it that a supposedly intelligent businessman decides it is in his best interests to remake his image in such a clownish way?"
"And then a question that begs to be asked: is this actually boosting his brand in a marketable way? He's now solidly written off 60% of the country, and of the remaining 40% perhaps 50-70% also think he's a fucking moron. lolOne theory is that Trump is running for political favors.  His antics are an attempt to keep the media focus on him and not the other candidates.  This gives the real candidates an easier time through the primaries with less in fighting and less media scrutiny on there records.    That is devious as *fuck*, but totally something I'd expect out of Trump (or really the entire Republican presidential slate, admittedly).this particular run is pretty strange from a self promotion stand point. He has lost a bunch of high profile business partners with his baseless and crude remarks. Maybe, in a strange way, this is his real run for the white house. > Maybe, in a strange way, this is his real run for the white house."
"Honestly, I do wonder if you are right. Everyone keeps saying no, he's not serious it's all a ratings move but really... what if he IS serious? I mean, the guy is a certain kind of crazy, that much is clear. Perhaps this is all meant in dead seriousness, and he really does think he has what it takes to be elected.Yep, Trump doesn't want to be president. It's not like that would give him all the attention his narcissistic heart desires. Nope. Right?  I keep seeing Trump is really just running to boost his brand.  Just because that seems like a good idea, doesn't mean that's ACTUALLY the reason he's running for president.  It MAY be the reason he's running, but there's absolutely no real evidence and people state it like it's fact."
"Most people aren't delusional narcissists, so I can understand trying to attribute reasonable goals to Trump's actions.  Still, it's annoying that people tout their theories as facts without any evidence to back it up besides Trump would have to be crazy if he actually thinks he can win.  Trump might be as crazy as he looks guys.It's pretty clear no one is as confident in donald trump as donald trump. His ego is bigger than the national debt.Except Donald Trump was aged 45 25-years-ago."
"If I were judged by what I did at 45 - well, I'm not even 45 yet.Yeah, I'm pretty sure I wasn't presidential material 25 years ago, but I was 3 so it's not exactly the same.Literally 25 years ago was nine months before I was born so I was busy jumping from my dad's dick into my mom's snatch."
"I couldn't run for president I was busy running the race for my life. Yea but it's not the only time you jumped from your dad's dick to your mom's snatch...Nice how you just elided the accompanying genocide of millions.Sex scandal!> I was busy jumping from my dad's dick into my mom's snatch."
"Half of you was. The other half was just hanging out waiting for something to happen.You were trying to make something of yourself. Commendable.Pulling himself up by his ballstraps.Making a vas deferens.25 years ago /u/cheesechimp threw a temper tantrum in a local grocery store. Is this the kind of person you want in the Oval Office? I thought not."
"Vote Trump 2016, public temper tantrum free for over 26 years. I dont think Ive ever heard him speak except in public tantrums. 25 years ago /u/cheesechimp poopied in his pants.  Do you want him to poopie in the Oval Office?"
"Vote Huggies 2016.  Keeping you dry and fresh, always.> Vote Trump 2016, public temper tantrum free for over 26 ~~years hours minutes~~ seconds..."
"ftfy"
"It seems like the last 26 years has been a continuous temper tantrum.That last part is a bit debatable, isn't it? I've never actually seen him throw a public temper tantrum. Just say absurd things in that weird way of his that is devoid of emotion but also sounds like hes trying to talk over jet engines. Didn't he sue someone for a billion because they called him a millionaire?Oh, right. Maybe he is several varieties of psychopath. Who are you going to believe, Mr Trump, or the liberal Mexican-loving commie media? TRUMP SIXTEEN! TRUMP SIXTEEN!I like you, you're a straight shooting, no B.S. kind of personHe's 70????"
"Edit:  Wow he's only 3 years younger than Sanders.  I guess no one can throw that age card in there.Hildog isn't a spring chicken either.Yea, she had a stroke...That was only to get back at Bill and Monica, though.The opening is great."
"Queen's I want it all playing over a montage of decadent scenes from the 80's."
"And forget Trump not wanting this thing released, I bet Melanie Griffith wishes that footage of her hair style was long gone.Yeah, but Melanie grew up with lions as pets instead of trophies, so she gets a free pass."
"http://imgur.com/CUpFBsJhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cny_D50Rr44"
"I just watched ROAR a couple of days ago. It's a movie with her crazy ass parents and like 200 wild big cats in one house. Everyone is getting attacked and running from lions, it cost $14 million to make and every single attack scene is real. I highly recommend it."
"The trailer says it all:"
"It's like Walt Disney went insane and shot a snuff version od Swiss Family Robinson"
"Pure chaos the entire time. I looked up Melanie Griffith on Wikipedia because of this post.  I was completely unaware that Dakota Johnson from the 50 Shades movie was the daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson.She should never have kissed that dentist.[**Here**](https://player.vimeo.com/video/134895538) is the full documentary.Why did I have to scroll down so far?"
"That's not you're fault though. Thank you friend.[Here's the direct link to the documentary.](http://trumpthemovie.com/watch)"
"I'm going to watch it for science."
"*edit: The Not-So-IMDB Review*"
"I learned nothing new.  The premise of the film seems to be he's a shrewd business man, loves to leverage (power, politics, money), and has failed at many business ventures, and is an asshole (has he ever denied this?).  Can we not say this about most successful business men?  It almost felt like it was saying that Trump would lose all his money due to his incompetence, but here we are in 2015 and he's still rich as fuck."
"With that said, DJT is a shit-bag.  I got more of an idea of who Trump was by watching The Central Park 5 documentary, which was great. Fuck Trump.  What a scumbag."
"I do find it interesting that he leads the polls, while holding exact opposite moral values of conservative beliefs.  I'm a long time Republican who is voting for Bernie.Feel the Bern!So was it worth the watch?No.Long time Republican voting for Bernie? Something doesn't add up lolBernie is left by current U.S. Standards but is actually more conservative than the far right by UK standards. IMO the U.S. Democratic Party is becoming pretty moderate, and the Republican Party is becoming extremist right. Hence trumps standing. [deleted]I hear you on his gun control issues.  I'm a supporter of the 2A.  He did say something that I agreed with in regards to gun control, though - something to the effect that gun violence in Chicago is different from gun violence in rural Vermont."
"I worked law enforcement in a large city, with rural surroundings.  It was very common, to come in contact with law-abiding citizens armed with a gun.  In fact, I had a farmer hold a robbery suspect at gun point, after the suspect led us on a pursuit and crashed on this farmer's property.  Funny shit."
"I think the important thing is to allow ownership of guns, but require background checks.  This is where my views sway away from most conservative views.  Also, stop calling semi-automatic rifles, that appear to look military, assault rifles.  It fires the same way a semi-automatic handgun fires.I know several Republicans on board the Bernie Train."
"I see Sanders' views on big corporations and money in politics, as bigger than any other issues we face today. You fix that and I feel as if a lot of reform can be made in our nation.  Yes, I don't agree with some of his opinions and ideas.  But one thing I don't question, is his honesty and compassion towards all his constituents.This guy sums up how I feel too, you have to play the cards you're dealt and so far the cards are *awful* in both parties.  I strongly disagree with Bernie on some issues, very strongly, but at least I trust him.  Which is more than I can say for every other fucking candidate."
"I voted for Obama even though I lean toward free market economics and small government, and I'd vote for him a third time if I could.  He's a lot more conservative than people think, I think he's a great president.  Can't file people into neat little boxes, we have complex thoughts, feelings, and motivations."
"Ninja edit:  I think the problem is that a lot of us who would like to consider ourselves republican feel alienated by the party because of the religion thing, the freedom for women to choose what they want to do with their bodies, the rhetoric on immigrants, sexual preference/marriage, and climate science and general science ignorance.  Those things are deal breakers and a bit ironic for a party who claims to be in favor of government staying out of your personal business.I don't know, have you *seen* the republican candidates? All 500 of them?Why would a long-time republican vote for a liberal socialist?"
"Were you lying before or now?Morally/socially conservative (e.g. the religious right) and economically/fiscally conservative (e.g. *laissez-faire* economics and the stereotypical Wall Street banker) are two completely different things. Politics is not a one-dimensional spectrum.As I have stated in past comments, I grew up in a Christian home, with Republican parents.  I still hold many conservative views.  I just am tired of the money in politics, even at the lowest forms of government.  Bernie is the only candidate who is looking to fix this issue.  Through research, I have also changed my views on the belief that businesses are the force behind job creation.  I no longer believe this to be true.  I just wanna know one thing: What's the story behind the guy who was 'slain outside the building' or whatever. Did Trump put a hit on someone?I believe, they were discussing his business connections with men associated with the mob.  It never directly stated Trump was involved with the murder.  Perhaps the narrative wanted the viewer to draw this opinion? I'm not sure.  I never felt that way.  It was all loosely tied together, imo.>I do find it interesting that he leads the polls, while holding exact opposite moral values of conservative beliefs."
"You need to remember there are social conservatives and fiscal conservatives.True.I just can't read the title without a Jerry Seinfeld in my head.> I'm a long time Republican who is voting for Bernie."
"That is very inspiring.  I have high hopes for Bernie's campaign.40 min in. Better than I expected Cheers!> holding exact opposite moral values of conservative beliefs"
"As someone with no horses in the primary on either side, I'm curious how that's true. His moral compass seems pretty squarely in line with free market economics, which is what people know him for. Or am I missing something?I'm no republican, but how exactly is he supporting free markets? The few things I've heard him say are about strict immigration controls and keeping those select people out of the american markets. Restrictions = a free market champion?"
"Well, I grew up in a Christian family.  I went to a private Christian school.  I went to church three times a week.  My family was, and still are, devout Christians.  They disagree with abortion.  They disagree with gay marriage, under the guise of, the sanctity of marriage."
"Trump is the anti-child for any argument of the sanctity of marriage.  He's a known womanizer, adulterer, fornicator, etc., etc...  It's disheartening to see them accept this man as great, when he's truly a terrible person, who has no moral compass."
"I will accept that his free market economics fits Republican voter's mindset.  I just think if they really understood trickle down economics, they would see the flaw in it.Every time I hear/read the phrase trickle down economics I want to blow my brains out."
"THE PHRASE STARTED AS A GODDAMN POLITICAL JOKE. Will Rogers was making fun of the rich. Literally, it did not originate as an economic theory and hasn't ever really been a theory."
"i.e. he's fiscally conservative and not socially conservative.The problem with your logic is you expect people to actually look below the surface. People voting trump don't give a fuck much like people on the other side of the spectrum voting Hilary don't give a fuck about her corruption. It's disheartening. How is Hilary corrupt? [I'm honestly curious, I'm not American so I don't know much about her.][deleted]We have a right to destroy all of our drinking water to turn a profit but those two people over there can't get married, too many dangly bitsThanks for taking the time to respond -- I appreciate it!But... he's not for free market economics. Free market economics does not rely on government assistance to shed failing investments through bankruptcy. That's actually relying on government intervention for financial gains. That's just straight greed. He did that 5 times. Also, free market economics does not call for economic sanctions and alterations to trade agreements based on overexaggerated false information. He's just a grab bag of conservative ideologies that when summed up best resemble a plutocracy, rather than anything else. Puting a foreign tax to favor the national industry isn't a very free market thing to doReally wish people would hold off on the crazy stuff about Donald until after he gets the Republican nomination or decides to run independent."
"I really do not want Jeb Bush....Yeah, let's just hand it to Hillary since she's the answer to all our problems...Absolutely. The guy has no chance of wiining. Discrediting him now just means that a real scumbag has a better chance. Leave him alone.the public always chooses the best person for the job, that's why Obama is president.What difference do you think it would make?Fuck both of them, really.Bush v Clinton 2016"
"Corporate America's wet dream ticket.If It comes down to Hillary or Donald Trump, I'm voting Trump. If it comes down to Hillary or Bush, I'm not fucking voting.Just curious why you would in no situation vote for Hilary but would vote for Trump?Exactly what they want you to doI'm really hoping he runs as an independent. It will basically guarantee a republican loss in 2016.We won't vote for himThe Republican establishment almost definitely would not vote for him. Moderate Republicans in general probably won't vote for him."
"Far-right Republicans, anti-government, full-on crazies still might. If he runs as an independent, even if he could get maybe 2-3% of the vote, it could still have an impact on the election. Ralph Nader running as a Green Party candidate screwed over Al Gore."
"Here's the situation tho - Let's say we get a General Election with these candidates"
"Hillary Clinton - Democrat"
"Jeb Bush - Republican"
"Donald Trump - Independent"
"Hillary and Bush are more similar candidates than Hillary and Obama. That's how moderate she is. Bush is obviously a more moderate Republican. There would be very little separating these two on the issues."
"If Trump were to even grab a small portion of the base for himself, it would SCREW Jeb Bush, because in order to stand a chance at winning then, he needs to dominate among Independents/Undecideds."
"You didnt hear? Bernie Sanders is getting the Republican nomination I've heard of him I heard he's speaking at the Waffle House across from the democratic national convention. Bernie holds the record for largest presidential rally for ALL candidates in this cycle.  His recent crowds have been huge.   Keep talking the failure game though to ensure no other candidate but the approved one has a chance."

"http://time.com/3963695/bernie-sanders-biggest-rally/From a foreign perspective it seems really odd, that the u.s. has political dynasties like the Bush or Clinton families. And even more odd that they keep getting elected over and over again on all political levels. I mean on the one hand the u.s. is said to be >the< democracy, on the other hand it looks like it's rulled more like monarchie or oligarchie."
"Why do people keep electing these dynasty families?The crazy stuff is making him rise in the polls.  Republicans love it."
"He is polling twice as high as jebjeb.[Read this](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/donald-trump-is-the-nickelback-of-gop-candidates/). It's not that he is well liked, it's that he has a plurality of supporters. 20% of likely GOP voters love the shit out of him compared to 43% who find him unfavorable altogether. The field is so diluted that having 20% makes him #1. Political opinions aside, Trump as president would be one hell of an entertaining 4 years. There wouldn't be a dull moment that is for sure. He'd either say something outrageous or rub some random foreign dignitary the wrong way on a daily basis. Probably be random skeletons in the closet popping up non-stop."
"This election is shaping up to be quite the shit show / circus.That is what happens when you dumb down the population to where they watch reality tv competitions for 8 hours every night. I get the feeling that *every* election will be that way from now on, until the entire system is overhauled.  Which very well might not be until after the apocalypse.I for one welcome U.S. President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho as my new overlord.At least he listens to people smarter than him. He sought out a solution to the problems they faced, rather than ignoring the problems and claiming everything is fine.If you told me ten years ago that Bush, Clinton, and Trump were running in 2016, I would've punched you in the face.I still feel like punching everyone who says this to me.I think shit show will suffice, a circus usually involves at least a few talented individuals.Lying / manipulating is a talent, and these are some of the worlds best.( deg [?] deg) CLOWN FIESTA ( deg [?] deg)1990 was 25 years ago. Ugh.when He said 25 years ago I instantly thought 1985 hahah. Time flies.And 1965 was 25 years before 1990. It's crazy to think that the difference between now and 1990 is the same as the difference between 1990 and 1965.There are porn stars that were born in 1996. Ugh.1997, evenI don't mind this.[You've Been Trumped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%27ve_Been_Trumped) is an interesting documentary film. It's about him being an arsehole in Scotland. Building a golf course and shitting on the locals."
"edit: gold -> golfThis documentary took my opinion of him from loathesome to irredeemable, and it didn't even have to work hard.  It just showed him being a developer and how it affected the people around him."
"My favorite part was when the cops pull up to find the filmmaker interviewing some locals.  They can't find any crime there, so they drive away.  Couple minutes later they're back and have the filmmaker's face slammed in the hood of a car getting cuffed."
"I wonder why they just changed their mind like that... /s[deleted]Can we get a gif?Yeah, that's especially scary because of the implication - the Scottish police force isn't typically thought of as corrupt, but in that documentary it was very obvious that either they were in the pocket of Trump Inc. or (more likely) someone higher up was.I liked the bit where Trump points at some houses and says We'll knock those down and his assistant says I think someone lives there and Trump says I don't care."
"What a cunt. He tried to sue the BBC (because he likes to sue everyone because he's a dick) for defamation for that film. It got nowhere because the BBC tried again and again and again to reach him to give him the right to reply and he refused. > The creator released is for free."
"Fine, I'll take one creator please.I mean, I hate Donald as much as the next guy, but this looks like a smear piece that I don't need to hate him."
"Rich gonna Rich.Sorry, are you hating him because he's rich?  Or because of how he got rich?  Being rich isn't a good reason to hate him, but if you hate him because of how his business tactics got him rich, then I understand.Well you don't *now*, but if the film was supposed to be released 25 years ago that might make more sense.Everyone knows he is a buffoon..."
"That's exactly what the narrator says in the clip.  How could this possibly be a balanced piece?"
"EDIT  Fine, sorry I said balanced.  I meant the trailer/docu should be balanced with facts and figures, not just a stream of inflammatory and polarizing insults.Who says it was or should be balanced?Is it being advertised as a balanced piece?Not in the least.  But inflammatory language like that makes it difficult to be taken seriously.That's what lost me.  I get it.  He's a prick.  Your movie isn't going to be what convinces me of that."
"It's a smear piece.Then this movie isn't for you, but for the people who legitimately don't realize it. Nobody is gonna force you to watch it. Do you get mad at pro-vaccination ads because you already know that vaccinations don't cause autism?Exactly.  I've always seen him as a one dimensional cartoon character.  I think this is just a rally piece to be shown for college youth political groups.Documentaries aren't about balance, they're about truth.  You wanna complain about a documentary on North Korea focusing on the bad death camps and not the fun loving side of Dear Leader?Of course not, but if the trailer for a docu on Dear Leader has the narrator saying He's a buffoon and showing comics of him being painted as a clown...yea, I get it.  We know this.  There are less direct ways to show information, it is a little insulting to be spoon fed like that.Then the complaint should be about the name calling, not the lack of balance.I don't get this mentality of reddit. Documentarians don't have to be balanced. They're just making their argument through examples and interview of people with insight and piecing it together in a movie. I can't stand when people get mad that it doesn't cover both sides. If Donald Trump wants a documentary about his altruistic side (haha) he can have someone make it for him. It's like saying nobody should vote for Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton because they don't help prove republican arguments along with their own.Because resorting to name calling is typically a sign of a weak argument. Or entertainingName calling doesn't inherently weaken an argument. If it's a good argument, it will be good either way. We haven't seen the movie, but knowing Donald Trump, I can't see it not being a good argument even if it's stud that some people already know> We haven't seen the movie"
"Did you finish the trailer? http://trumpthemovie.com/watchThat's because a monkey could create a decent argument against Trump.  He's a fucking moron."
"Moron like a foxDocumentaries are notoriously one-sided and rarely ever balanced.I get the sense that this documentary is trying to explain how he's not nearly as rich as he says he is, and his ability to amass wealth is kinda his most redeeming quality.He would have more wealth if he had just invested his father's fortune in mutual funds rather than all the stupid crap he built then bankrupted"
"edit: [Here's the evidence](http://www.moneytalksnews.com/why-youre-probably-better-investing-than-donald-trump/). Whether you call it Trump's fortune or his father's (and there is no way the first exists without the second), Donald would have amassed a greater fortune if he had stopped working 30 years ago. The only thing he's 'good' at is making money and he's not really great at doing that either; he just has enough wealth to mask his failed ventures.I don't know about that, his father died in 1999 with 300mil."
"Assuming a 7% return, it would take 50 years to turn that into 10 Billion.  Even if you don't think he is worth that much, in 16 years, at 7%, he would not even total 1Billion, and that is assuming 0 spend.Made in the 80's by some British guy80's kids like me remember Trump as being synonymous with wealth and success. We all laughed when he went bankrupt. The only thing I'm interested in about this documentary is his mob affiliations, and that's just because I have a general interest in the mob.I hope he wins so hard.  Right? Remember those YouTube compilations of stupid shit that Bush said while in office? Those will look like Nobel Prize acceptance speeches compared to what Trump will give us.TUCK FRUMPMusic is not loud enoughI mean I know personally he wants to be president but the whole Trump backing isn't per say people that want him elected. A lot"
"of people like myself support him not because we want him as president but because he's backed by his own money so he isn't afraid to tell other politicians how it is. He's saying a lot of things (not all) but a lot of it that need to be said. Unfortunately most candidates can't say much because they're afraid to lose funding. Half these politicians are idiots and someone needs to stand up and tell them. Unfortunately it's Trump doing it but that's all we got. (No I'm not voting for him)This is an interesting point that I had not consideredExtremely good point. Not to mention, the fact that he is being SOOO non PC and different while still gaining in the polls is completely unheard of and I'm sure most campaign managers are paying attention."
"Hate Trump or love him. I hope this can stir up politics in general and we might start seeing politicians that speak their minds start gaining more in the polls rather than being crucified every time. Although I don't know if this will happen in the democratic party anytime soon...it just seems to get more and more PC. You think a notoriously corrupt man, is invincible to corruption? Lol that's so preposterous.  He is a known abuser of power and money - he will abuse presidential power too."
"And, NOTHING he has said, needs to be said.  He's a blowhard moron who appeals to racist idiots. Y'all should watch *Small Potatoes: Who Killed The USFL?*"
"One of the first 30 for 30 films. Fuckin' Trump, man. Epic sound track. Why are we talking about this silly man? Another great Trump doc is  You've been Trumped just watched it today, he's some scummer.http://trumpthemovie.com/watchhere is the full doc.."
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcOTQLh0lX4Sooo, why does a trailer for a documentary made 25 years ago consist largely of recent footage?The only thing I can think of is the guy who originally produced and made the documentary re-edited the movie and trailer to include modern clips from his presidential run so that it could apply to more present times and not just some unreleased documentary that was made 25 years ago.Just watched it. It is literally just a 25 year old documentary with nothing new added.[This frame](http://imgur.com/TbvHjNC) from the documentary, /r/punchablefacesthe OG duckface"
"MAGNUM!Donald Trump has permanent duck face.[So similar](http://www.supernaturalwiki.com/images/1/15/Zoolander.jpg)So, how did Donald Trump suppress this? Did he use his wealth and influence to convince theaters to not play this?"
"Or is that just one of those lazy cop outs to drive interest via a faux Streisand effect?Compelling video! Trump has my vote!TRUMP 2016[deleted]The Bernie Sanders following is so strong on Reddit it creeps me out a bit :pIm not claiming he is a good candidate or bad for president. But there are some points that I think should be considered:"
"1) We (american society) lambaste politicians for using a teleprompter and not have well crafted original responses. We jump at an opportunity to get Obama or anyone else. When candidates don't use a teleprompter you can get a glimpse into their true intentions. When Donald trump repeatedly goes on stage, he shoots from the hip and sometimes says some dumb shit. That what we get when every word is not crafted before hand. (Aside from the John Mccain statement) that was just a stupid comment. The flip side is to give him a teleprompter and make him like every other perfect puppet."
"2) Arrogance is an essential ingredient to being a president. Obama certainly has it but it is dressed up nicely. Trump doesn't care if people don't like him which will be better for America when a difficult decision has to be made."
"3) He is LESS likely to pander to lobbyists because of his wealth."
"Again, I am not saying he is the candidate, but it is VERY refreshing to hear someone who is not a career politician. Everyone else is so worried that they will misspeak because their lives literally depend on staying in office. Just think of the other things they will and wont do to keep their office. They are all compromised."
"Please offer a counter point. Thanks Reddit!Honestly, I've looked at the actual full videos of most of his controversial statements and almost ALL of them were taken extremely out of context. Which makes sense because almost non of the articles blasting him actually link to the video, except for the McCain one. I would say even the McCain one, he was probably more orienting towards the career McCain had and the incidents he had in the Military besides being a POW. It was a horrible time to express it but this is what he was trying to refer to. I'm a veteran, but I try to be objective when I hear people's opinions on the military. He just said it very awkwardly and probably realized right then there's not much point because it's nearly impossible to get any argument in once someone has hero status, which I do get sick of. McCain is a hero, but that doesn't make him infallible or diminish all of the other aspects of his life that doesn't make him that fit to be in the position he's in.What's happening is the media is trying to destroy him because he doesn't fit the narrative of a Bush/Clinton race.  They were so sure the McCain thing would be the ticket that they immediately wrote articles about Trump's downfall before even gauging the public's response.Donald: I'm REALLY rich!"
"Der Scutt: You hear a figure quoted by Donald. You divide by 2 then divide by 4 and you're probably closer to the real answer."
"9 Billion /2 = 4.5 Billion. 4.5/4 = 1.125 Billion."
"I'm going to go out on a limb and say he's still REALLY rich. He is a dope but do we really need a hit piece like this?"
"Man found dead, he had a card in his pocket that thousands of other people had. Donald must have pulled the trigger..."
"He is so evil, the base boards in my apartment are of low quality...."
"This reminds me of a movie my mom sent me about evil Hillary.  In one part of the movie they list all the deaths that were somehow caused by the Clintons.  People they knew who mysteriously died.  A few of them were plane crashes.  The FAA keeps pretty good records so I looked them up.  One of them was that it was foggy and the guy flew into the side of a mountain in his little private plane.  So of course the Clintons must have caused the fog and moved the mountain there.  If a piece is going to use evidence like that then I can't trust anything else that I cannot verify.  Another was some guy committed suicide... and the movie said it was a murder that was made to look like a suicide, but they couldn't prove it.  I look it up and the guy went to a psychiatrist a week before and got some anti depressants.  So obviously a guy who is depressed would never commit suicide, Hilary must had done it."
"In this trump thing.. He hired illegals to work on a building. His excuse? His company hired a contractor who hired a subcontractor, he didn't know they were illegal.  You know, that sounds like a pretty freaking reasonable explanation.  Could he have done more? Sure... But when I hired someone to work in my house I didn't check the greencards of the workers.  So I'm just as big of a dope as Trump."
"The guy is a dope with a lot of money.  This doesn't mean the guys who made this movie weren't dopes as well. From the trailer I suspect that he is a dope too."
"Edit: I forgot one part.  He made his money using other peoples money. How evil.  HOW THE HELL DO YOU THINK THE WORLD WORKS!  If someone gives you money and you make a profit for him and yourself thats pretty much a good thing.  When I sold my house for more than the mortgage was I made money with other peoples money (Specifically a loan from my family), does that mean I'm Hitler like Trump? YesBernie 2016!I'm sure this is just straight reporting and isn't biased at all.Now we know who originated the duck face.The Trans-Pacific Partnership is an attack on America's business...this is a bad deal. -[Donald Trump](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/590982593736286208)Is anyone else not really phased by anything in this trailer?"
"I just feel like So what?!?!"
"Remember how that anti-Obama documentary was racist. This is heroic, though5k upvotes and only 900 views on YouTube. Not defending him, but this definitely proves that people love to hate famous people they think they should hate.Blatant mudslinging.I just take it as Trump has both sides scared that he is willing to speak from his heart.  (not to mention that leftist reddit has a hard on for Sanders)"
"The info presented in that video was just pure mudslinging with little evidence to back it up.This feels like an attack ad taking on the form of an attack movie. is this really necessary? Also get the feeling that someone paid for this out of pocket to resurrect it from the grave. He's done enough dumb shit in the past 2 weeks that this seems a bit overkill.Wow, this documentary looks like fucking shit. At least try to be slightly unbiased when promoting it. I'm not a big Trump fan but this movie looks like a half assed smear commercial. The trailer is so over the top in it's smearing that I don't even want to see the movie now."
"I like the mob connection which involved some guy who was killed that had a Trump Casino comp card in his pocket. Because everyone that gets a comp at a casino personally knows the owner, right?I hope Donald Trump makes the Republican ticket because it'll mean autowin for the democrats.Sooo, why does a trailer for a documentary made 25 years ago consist largely of recent footage?[deleted]They've updated it to include recent footage and events?Nope, just watched it. It's a 25 year old documentary.link for the lazy http://trumpthemovie.com/watchReminds me of the numerous Clinton documentaries that have suppressed over a long period of time.Someone saw a chance to try and drive some revenue for a quarter century old documentary.Trump is this weeks Walker on Reddit."
"If Mr. Rodgers ran as a republican there would be links all over the place for about a week about his service in Vietnam and before you know it he would be known as Mr. Fred 'Babykiller' Rodgers. Come on, don't pretend Trump isn't a piece of shit just because he's a Republican. Even if it's true that reddit hates any Republican (which isn't true considering the love for Ron and Rand Paul), that doesn't mean the hate for some of them isn't deserved. Not to mention Trump would be equally hated if he ran as a Democrat. It's not the label people hate, it's the ACTUAL THINGS HE'S SAYING. I guarantee if a guy like Jon Huntsman gained some traction in the GOP, reddit would be completely on board with him. Is it worse than this one about Hillary? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYW5nmS9psUsually arrogance comes after a political victory. Trump's is already arrogant, I seriously think his head will explode if he actually pulls this off and becomes President.It's pretty obvious how much some people don't want this man to be president.Meh.  The worst you could say about the guy doesn't compare to Benghazi, the corruption, and lying, Hildebeast brings to the table. She's almost comic book level criminal.  It's stunning the number of people who think she's the greatest thing since sliced bread.  Interesting documentary - I didn't see any new info/footage about more recent endeavours as the trailer suggests though, it looks like it was released as-is from 1990.If the President Luthor arc has taught me anything, it's that Trump would summon hostile aliens to our planet as president.So he's a modern day William Randolph Hearst, basically?I suppose now he'll just sue the internet to make it go away."
"I want the guy yhat uploaded this video DEAD! I want his family DEAD! I want his house burned to the GROUND! I want everyone who downloaded it DEAD! Are Americans actually voting for this guy? If so, why?I know Trump is a pile of shit but for fuck's sake is this transparent. This is definitely paid for by a campaign. They just aren't pushing the candidate's name down anyone's throat. . . yet. Boy, what convenient timing.That's nice.  I don't think he will be President, but I LOVE how he makes all the other politics as usual candidates nervous. if he ran on the platform that he's gonna make a bigass wall on the mexican border, i'd probably vote for him.Do we really need a sleazy slam piece on a guy that everyone already knows is a scumbag? Seriously, Republicans don't even care at this point. They're willing to get behind whatever filth floats to the surface. Used to be that a Republican needed moral high ground. Now the evangelicals are looking the other way. Hilarious. This guy can't get the independent vote, so he can't win. I say let him win the primary...don't fight it. OMG he's a business man. Wtf does any expect a successful business person to be like. for joke candidate, its amazing how many people are shitting their pants over him, trying to destroy him as quick as possible..25 minutes in so far.  IMO he doesn't even look that bad.  He keeps setting really high completely impossible goals, gets them done and people are nitpicking about things we can't even confirm.  Tony Schwartz really isn't saying anything bad about him, and I feel like they cut out the praises."
"Also at one point they talk about how the media started to turn against him when they saw he cheated on his wife.  It feels like the makers of the documentary are part of that media."
"I'm only 25 minutes in btw so we'll see if things change.  Did trump also pay off all the top commenters to talk nonsense so that people who are lazily browsing and probably won't watch the documentary continue to know nothing of his shenanigans?Trump is a twat, but i'm already sick of this media smear campaign. It's worse than Trump.It's only a smear if untrue...........TIL that Donald Trump is a real life Lex Luthor.Never before has Twitch chat meme been so relevant:"
"ehm...ehm... T U C K  F R U M PMOVIE: You've Been Trumped  http://www.youvebeentrumped.com/youvebeentrumped.com/THE_MOVIE.htmlTrump is wackIs anyone else the most surprised Trump doesn't own trumpthemovie.com?The full film: https://vimeo.com/134895538If Superman says he's a bad guy then that's all we need to know.That's my theory and I'm sticking with it :)Was Trump the inspiration for Blue Steel?!If you ever get the chance to watch the documentary Queen of  versailles do it."
"That also gives you a snap shot to how evil Trump is.There's probably a lot of substance in this documentary, but it goes off the rail into tabloid levels of harassment and sensationalism when it begins saying it pissed off superman and compares Trump to Lex Luthor. That's a Trump level of douchery right there.Top fact: Lex Luthor's a genius super villain precisely because he had hair like Trump and had the self awareness to shave his head.They made a joke...This is interesting. I'm curious if this documentary will play out the same way Dinesh D'souza's documentary on Barack Obama did. Seemed like it did nothing but pander to the lowest common denominator, in this case, political fanatics.Divide by 2, then divide by 4, probably closer to the real answer"
"What if, just what if, we divided by 8 for the real answer?Trump also threatened me with lawsuits in 2012.  After I made a Donald Trump iPhone game."
"The app was in the app store for a few months, it had sold maybe 50 copies for $1."
"Then one day I get a phone call from Michael Cohen, the EVP and Special Counsel of the Trump organization.  I'm still not sure how he even got my phone number, usually any legal stuff from the app store is emailed to me.  But he did use bully tactics and threats to get it removed, saying things like if you don't remove it, you'll regret it in a thick New York accent.Am I the only one who thinks of Dan Halen from Squidbillies when thinking of Donald Trump? I bet this was the interview."
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2VoNSx_khs[deleted]Okay, slightly off-topic, but reading through this entire thing with the [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-trumpweb/fjkehfaokpmcbigmbgdhmjblecgfkedg?hl=en) that adds real quotes of his into Donald Trump's name is hilarious. lmao.....gosh i hope he's not gonna be our president Why? Because he's no saint? That describes everyone in D.C."
"I dont like him personally,  but might vote for him,  because Im not looking for a buddy,  but a president.  He has a strong platform, which is far more than can be said than rest of the callow politicans running.  They couldn't enact change with a bulldozer. Trump likely can"
"The other alternatives are a pinko,  or a murderer and liar. Free documentary just came out for free?  I know, let's link to the trailer!I'm less interested in trump and more interested in why society is interested in trump. That's the documentary I want to see Car crash/Train wreck mentality for pretty much everyone."
"Hard Right love his brand of unapologetic racism and classism and want to get their own prejudices validated. There's also the race-to-the-bottom that's going on among the other Republicans trying to out-crazy Trump with Huckabee taking the lead in that race."
"Centrists and Right of Center have no idea what do with him because they're actually trying win an election. Your establishment candidates that collapse into stammering when asked to comment on whatever awful thing Trump just said or did."
"And everyone left of center is having a laugh at the chaos and riding the outrage bandwagon."
"All in all it's some fun election year politics that drives eyeballs and clicks to major news organizations. So you see more stories about the circus because people like to talk about a circus.what if... ,and this is a huge what if, trump was really a democrat and was running for Prez as republican just to lose the election to the Democrats. Think about it. I can't recall the last time i heard anything at all from any other candidate. He is eating up all of the airtime with his buffoonery. He throws the election so the dems take it.  You could almost say that about any Republican candidate. Finished watching it, basically he mooched off his pops in the real estate gamble. Used a shit load of tax abatements for his personal gain yet they backfired horribly. This guy will lead America to the fucking ground for sure!Nothing says credibility like a mullet. more empty insults without any actual substantial information, at all. Nice try Don.why do I care what some git thinks about trump from 25 years ago?It's a good way to put into context what is going on now. Smear job because he's kicking ass and telling some hard truths.Why wouldn't you link directly to the movie?"
"www.trumpthemovie.comWhy not link directly to the movie, movie."
"[http://trumpthemovie.com/watch](http://trumpthemovie.com/watch)Why not movie the movie directly movie, movie?Meh.   Of course he's rich, he's been a businessman all his life."
"What i want to know is how did the Clintons come into their millions of wealth and properties, when they've been in politics most of their careers."
"Politicians should not become millions richer.  We have proof today from Clinton's released emails that she & the state department lied about Benghazi . They did absolutely nothing to help the ambassador."
"But a 25-year-old trump documentary is certainly more important than that!!!"
"tth_tthThis is still a thing?This documentary needs more random guitar solo.I'm totally a part of the reddit Sanders Circlejerk-- and don't really care for Trump, but whenever stuff this old surfaces about anyone and we all make it a big deal, it makes me hope people aren't still judging me for what I did 10, 15, or even 20 years ago. People do change."
"Also at;dc (about trump;didn't care) also at;dw (about trump;didn't watch)Is trump actually a serious contender in the presidential race? I hear about the things he does and says from over here in europe and it sounds like a troll playing huge joke on everyone.I like Trump. He speaks his mind and doesn't afraid of anything.**More bullshit anti trump propaganda.**Its like he waited for Jon Stewart to retire so he could run for president.I have a guilty secret to confess.  As bad as it would be for the country I sort of want Trump elected exactly like I wanted Rob Ford elected and for exactly the same reason.  The failure would be SPECTACULAR."
"Trump 2016: Why vote for the lesser evil?Interesting documentary but this is just a political smear campaign. No matter what they bring up about him, he looks like the Virgin Mary if you hold him up against Hillary.  That woman is just as power hungry and insane as SNL tries to make her out to be.I've looked at all the articles and documentaries about Trump, and not once have they ever been fair to him. They always twist his words and take them in the worst possible way and never show his side of the story. I guess it's just because he's rich, and people want to blame the rich for all their problems out of jealousy or spite or just pure ignorance. They never want to believe anything is their fault and so they'll believe anyone who offers a scapegoat. And why not? He's rich. He couldn't possibly have worked hard to get that money. He must have gotten it through thievery and trickery. Most people have no idea how insanely difficult it is to start and run a business. So, as much as I would love to give this documentary a shot, how do I know it's not just a more bitter, one-sided propaganda?__STILL CLEANER AND A BETTER CHOICE THAN BUSH OR CLINTON__How is this different from the movie *Atlas Shrugged* that came out just before the 2012 election and attempted to sway people from re-electing Obama? Isn't this the exact same shady marketing propaganda that this website was against in 2012? The people who watched Atlas Shrugged were already not voting for Obama.Nobody gives a shit, he has zero chance at getting elected, why the fuck even bother.  People need to focus more energy on shit that actually matters. It's entertainment. Trump is like the tabloid journalism of presidential candidates.This is what happens when a billionaire decides to go on a trolling spree.I'm sure not going to sit through 1+ hour of Trump, but I'm just delighted that he's running for president.  Every day he's in the race drags the GOP even further into the swamp.  He's the gift that keeps on giving."
"If reddit really thinks that Trump is any worse than Clinton, Jeb, or anyone else running, you're delusional. Fucking shitlibs gotta shit their agenda over every sub.lol, wtf was seth meyers doing in that video?You mean Trump didn't earn his money honestly?  WOW what a fucking surpriseYa know. I just need to get this off my chest. Whenever a politician pisses off the media, it means they are doing something right. The fact that this has music from QUEEN tells me that they ar being funded by someone with vested interests in seeing Trump lose.Would still have him over Hillary American politics sucks... all the money is going into smearcampaigns.... USA the country of shame.As a republican, fuck trumpI seriously don't understand why people even give him this much air time, it is so easy to see that he is just making himself a target with an agenda which is absolutely CRYSTAL clear."
"FUCK , Even our 8 year old school kids will know for sure that something is wrong with a person if he goes around saying that he is worth 10 billion dollars !!!I'm just waiting for El Chapo to take"
"care of him."
"What kills me is I've heard multiple people in my wife's family and seen numerous people on Facebook say shit like: you know... If you really listen to him, he makes a lot of sense."
"I just sit and cringe. I guess if you're a biggot, racist, elitist maybe he does make sense. These people don't really care about this at all or they would have released it when they first made it. They're doing this because they know they're going make a lot of money from it, and that's it.[deleted]>$9,240,000,000"

"$1,155,000,000 is still nice.Just watched the whole doc!  A shame it wasn't aired when it was created, but great to put out there today.  Fuck you redditI feel like this made me want to vote for Trump.  You play a montage of a man with queen blaring in the background and I will vote for that person every single timeHe was bankrupt in the 90's had illegals slaving for him and that was known back then, how is he any better now.I can't believe this idiot is leading the polls... Jesus christ America...People are sick of fawning political correctness. Trump is the politically incorrect candidate.Trump is a sideshow and this whole presidential run is a smokescreen. The fact that he is the center of attention is exactly what the GOP wants. If the conversation is about what a moron Trump is it lets the rest of the field fly under the radar. The only chance they have to get someone elected is if they are exposed to the public in drips and drabs. Any prolonged attention for any candidate in the GOP field will reveal that they're an unelectable doofus.Looks like the GOP played their Trump card.> **sideshow**"

"Fluoride contrails created by lizardmen confirmed."
"I work construction where people by and large lean right and Trump is VERY popular among them. I don't think this is a GOP plot man, the guy does say things that an unfortunate amount of people really like to hear. So many of my military friends want him. Nevermind he didn't serve or that John McCain thing. Really wish Reddit would stop bashing Trump all the time. Literally every post made about Trump that hits the front page is someone bashing him and/or his family and every post about Sanders has everyone praising his every move/decision."
"Quit being so biased.I just added something to my watch later playlist for the first time ever.Didn't he pull this stunt a few years ago?The guy at 2:50, now that's a mullet."
"https://youtu.be/7Qy75pRQKMU?t=2m50sWe have chosen our champion.That guy that didn't know pro bono meant free (or that a caveat is usually a bad thing), like it's some super secret rich-guy code for free meant to trick peasants.I watched it twice. Oh yes!He could be America's Berlusconi!My favourite one is [You've Been Trumped](http://www.youvebeentrumped.com/youvebeentrumped.com/THE_MOVIE.html) which he has tried to get banned a number of times."
"It's about how he basically bribed the Scottish Government to build his new golf course... ...over a protected national park.Trum**P**The PR war has started! I'm excited.was anyone else bothered by the hard popping P sounds made by the announcer?"
"Don't listen to the director of that documentary, that guy is a loser.I simply don't understand how anyone has ever liked Trump even a little even for a moment. Pundits are speculating about when his campaign will crash and burn. I don't know why it didn't crash and burn when he announced it. They're predicting he'll kick boo-boo in the debate because he's used to TV. I don't know. He's used to being on TV in situations where everyone around him is sucking up to him. (Key phrase in this comment: I don't know.)I am so happy I get to watch is free!That aspect ratio. Video has come a long way in 25 years.There's also a more recent one called You've Got Trumped, although that one specifically is about some Scottish locals trying to stop the Trump Organisation from building a golf resort in their backyard (also a nature reserve).the one thing I have learnt from documentaries is... they don't change shitThe title sounds like a Seinfeld joke.Would any of this really surprise anyone.. I mean this guy has been a side show for decades.  I really question the relevance of these so called polls.  The thing that concerns me the most, is the liberal media trying to desperately disparage his character, as if he is a legitimate threat.  They are doing more to validate him than any Republican could..  The air time alone is getting him noticed.  Keep it up CNN and you'll have another over-actor in a pivotal leadership role.Quick post every bad thing you can find about someone trying to participate in politics! It's interesting that after 25 years of being suppressed, it surfaces right as Trump is running for president and leading in the polls. I strongly dislike Trump on his own merits already, but this seems like it might be deliberate move.  you think?"
"plus 25 years ago was a loooong time - a lot of the clips had to do with donald trumps FATHER (a man who is long dead)This whole time I thought it was just a PR gag that this guy is running for Pres of the US. Holy shit you live in a fucked up country. This guy is serious.This is great entertainment while the right delays its Hispanic candidate to delay any digging of dirt.ayyyTrump kind of reminds me of rich Biff in back to the future 2. My dad told me years ago, trump isn't worth what he claims to be worth. His money is all in assets. It's always been known I think.that's a pretty shitty movie... can't even get the audio to sync to lips?This is the GOP at work here. They've gone into overdrive to shut down Donald Trump's gig he's got running. They are breaking out all the tools to get this smear job done right.The most interesting part of this trailer was the STELLAR get-up the red-haired Trump Tower tenant had about half way through. I mean, what a mullet! And that beard!Will this be anything like the two hour documentary about the clintons on YouTube?That background music *really* didn't help at all, I could barley hear the people speaking at points. [Dat mullet](https://youtu.be/7Qy75pRQKMU?t=2m48s)Lets not make another buffoon president of this beautiful place :)I've always known Trump was a dickhead.  I can not wait to watch this!!!"
"How many views do y'all think this video will have tomorrow?  Next week? I wonder if people know that this is the same style of film that sparked the Citizens United case.  Only, in that case, it was litigated because they released it too close to an election.  Someone want to give us a TL;DW?Why wait 25 years for this to be released? Believe me im no fan of trump or any republicans, but I can't help but wonder why was did this surface just now? Did the Koch brothers push some buttons in hopes of propelling Bush ahead of Trump?"
"Also here is a long-shot what if Trump is running for president with a sole purpose to prove how fucked up the political system, how racist republics are, how he was the only one that avoided being bought by the super rich donors,  & at the last second his the last guest on Jon Stewart's show endorsing Hillary.I hate Donald Trump. I mean, I really, really hate Donald Trump. Read my comment history for exactly how I feel about him."
"But this looks absolutely terrible and completely unprofessional.but seth meyers has ASSURED me he has less money than he has claimedSeth Meyers - trusted news sourcedoes anyone elses sound not work for both the trailer on youtube and also the sound on the actual website? my sounds works for everything elseIs anyone else running for president? Cause I don't see anyone else in the news about it, which is unsettling"
"*le reddit army has arrived*"
"HELL YES LADIES AND GENTS, bring in the cavalry The trailer is just about as cheesy as the man they mock.Can't take the narrator seriously ... he is interviewing cab drivers and calling Trump Lux Lether or w.e from the superman movies. I wanna see the doco but that's the worst trailer>25 years ago."
"smhI want to vote Trump just for the fun of it. I mean this man wants to build a fucking wall of china, what a joke."
"I obviously won't vote for him though.Arm yourself brothers! the war to restore sanity has begun.Why is it just a trailer if it was released for free?Here is the link to watch the full movie: http://trumpthemovie.com/watch"
"Should let him win the primary then release itMy shit has more class than Donald Trump.Nobody will be able to convince me that he is not just a ruse presented to us by this one party government.http://www.youvebeentrumped.com/youvebeentrumped.com/THE_MOVIE.htmlDonald Trump's about to sue somebody...and after he sues him, and the other guy, and the one before that, and then Bill Maher again...then this guy's going to get sued too.As someone who has historically found themselves on the liberal side of the fence, this looks like a giant pile of horseshit. I can't wait until he sues to have this removed from the internet.If you are really into political documentaries, watch Obama 2016This should have been rerevealed in october, let him climb the polls a bit more~~Title states that the documentary has been released for free. Yet the link leads to trailer and no sight of the full documentary anywhere here or at the YouTube channel. Where is the beef?~~"
"EDIT: You can watch the full documentary here http://trumpthemovie.com/watchI wonder if they paid for that queen songWhat the hell young Trump looks a lot like Trey Parker.[for the lazy](http://trumpthemovie.com/watch)I hope the movie itself has this same intense shredding guitar playing just as loud throughout the entire movie.I find it hilarious that trump is trying to be president. I'm gonna be so embarrassed if he becomes our president. LOL [Global warming was created by and for the Chinese](http://socialcontrol.com/blog-14-tweets-that-will-make-you-wonder-why-donald-trump-is-leading-in-the-polls/) -Donald TrumpPeople really need to stop  taking trump seriouslyThat VO sounds like it was done on a cassette recorder from 25 years ago.  Watch TRUM*PUH*, What's The Deal."
"If the narrator in the trailer also narrating the movie, I'm going to struggle.  His emphasis on the P in Trump makes my teeth itch.oh wow!!Just look at last 25 days of Trump and you will know almost everything about this scumbag. I love watching liberals getting all worked up about Trump's bid for presidency.  Trump's name on the ballot in the general election is the best possible thing that could happen to the left."
"That guy is completely unelectable, so he'd either cinch the loss for the Republicans or (somewhat more likely), run as an independent and draw enough votes away from the GOP to seal a democratic win. 25 years ago huh. Big fuckin deal?Yeah very interesting the story of how a very rich man managed to go bankrupt running a casino LOL"
"Donald trump is weird afSeason 5 Arrested Development confirmed. George Sr. runs for presidency.   dae not like donald trump"
"edit: plz respondClassic Trump.Has anyone else noticed that Trump is the typical evil rich guy from movies and T.V. shows?Donald Trump was relevant 25 years ago? Wouldn't be surprised if the Republican party paid for this piece...The film that Donald doesn't want you to see! reminds me of 5 secret tricks doctors don't want you to know! So Romney failed to be elected because he was filthy rich and what does the GOP do ? Nominate an even richer doofusSo if Trump is Lex Luthor then who is Superman?man Trump is the man! Donald Trump has anus mouth.Hehe his mouth looks like a butthole at first glance in the thumbnailMan, Trump is really an american version of Berlusconi. Here's the full documentary by the way."
"http://trumpthemovie.com/watchFor free? I doubt that. Somebody paid a lot of money to spread this documentary now that Trump is running for President. He is an asshole, but none the less. Always ask your self Que bono?, to whose benefit. Can't Stump the Trump!This documantary is so weak :/... I was expecting some goldmine, it just calls him a scumbag and an asshole. We already knew that!"
"I am questioning if this was released by Trump cause it has no evidence to show his shady side. Maybe this will help him keep going up in the polls.Can Trump run a country? I'm honestly asking. I only know he was on reality tv and has a lot of money. To me this is like Kim Kardashian running for president. He's gone bankrupt a number of times, if that's any indication.The creator released is for free. English motherfucker do you speak it?I love how we can all come together a d say how much we hate Donald Trump hereTrump has figured out the Obama strategy. The more the opposition criticizes him, the more powerful he seems to become."
"This kind of shit is just making Trump stronger at this point. It's like nuclear waste and Godzilla.Did Bob Costas narrate this?Donald Trump's Citizen Kane?http://trumpthemovie.com/watch/"
"thats the link for the full documentary heres the film: http://trumpthemovie.com/watchWhen you're at the top, everyone is trying to drag you down.I like how they say he's not rich while he flies around in his own airplanes, lives in yachts and penthouses, and does what he wants.Funny that the video has less than half the views than this post has upvotes.This looks really bad. I guess they're just releasing it now hoping to make a quick buck off his recent popularity.

Not sure if that's his style or just doesn't notice but he did the same thing in this documentary. [Perfect.](http://imgur.com/3rmnNNS)http://trumpthemovie.com/watch there's the fullit*?Superman's dead.Watched it . Not bad. Honestly, everything they brought up in the trailer seems like par for the course for someone as ultra rich as Trump. Treating other people like shit? Looking down on the lower class? Burning bridges and having absolutely brutal business sense? Yea...gotta think that isn't too crazy for many of them. How exactly did he suppress it?http://trumpthemovie.com/watch/BTW here is the video > http://trumpthemovie.com/watch/what's next?  An expose on Gaddafi being egomaniacal.  Full movie http://trumpthemovie.com/watch/Bet it won't be free nowHeh, he just can't comprehend someone doing something for free that he can't control with a pile of cash.you guys are wasting your time attacking this fool. he doesn't stand a chance in hell of winning the presidency anyways.

Id watch.Become rich by pushing others out of the way and being selfish cockadeerso a 25 year old documentary?  what good is this?  What is he up to now?I think the documentary does a good job of explaning that who he was is still who he is.   These are the things he did to get to where he is.Same ole, same ole...I get better vibes from used car salesmen.Just in case you didn't already have 0 chance of ever voting for the joker...lolIf anyone listens to Joe Rogan's podcast, a comedian named Joey Diaz brought up something very interesting. To paraphrase he essentially said that there was no way Trump was building skyscrapers in the 80s, without a Mafia connection, and once he gained more popularity, a lot of this shit would start coming out. And now it has.[removed]no need to torrent.  It's available to stream on their website. What if someone wants to watch it on their TV?Funny how people can find all of the skeletons in one's closet. lolThe title made me think it was by Jerry Seinfeld. Here's the (free to watch) link to the full movie vs the Trailer  http://trumpthemovie.com/Most of his money comes from crap games in Jersey. lolTrumPYou're FIRED!This is not the real documentary about Trump. The real movie is called Gremlins 2.The man who wanted to trademark the phrase You're Fired. Is now running for presidency. Seems a bit ironic.I'm starting to think trump was let loose by the democrats and the TPTB to make the Republicans look horrible. And the medias doing a great job covering it too. Hopefully this brief lapse of insanity ends and people realize there are much better candidates to look atThis is just more publicity for him.I haven't seen it, but I bet it makes him look like a douche bag.Worst audio ever. No doubt he's a scumbag but I'm going to watch it to see that guy in the trailers sick mullet. Thanks for making me dig for the link. And yes, this is 25 yrs old, but is there any evidence at all that he's not still a [malignant narcissist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignant_narcissism)?"
"I'll save the joke about slot machines in the congressional break room for later.Please repost if Trump is still in the race 6 months from now, ty.1) I didn't know Trump coined the peace sign."
"2) What a glorious Mullet."
"3) I am on a quest to play that board game.24:04 - NOBODY EXPECTS THE SPANISH INQUISITIONSo he basicaly  is The kingpin ?I dont see this doing anything.And here's the link to the actual film: http://trumpthemovie.com/watchCan't stand this guy"
"I didn't want to vote for Donald before this trailer, now I'm excited at the chance to."
"DONALD TRUMP 2016As much as I am against everything the donald stands for, he is so refreshing against the other candidates. and he is so outlandish that if he runs 3rd party (please do!) a democrat will almost certainly win...even if its hillary.Nice try Mr.Bush/Republican Party,he is still making you look like morons.Unfortunately all he's doing is making America and our political system look stupid. Nothing else.I've got a feeling Trump suppressed this documentary really means nobody cared about this boring bullshit back then, but we can bait an audience to watch it now.No, trump is the kind of coward that doesn't want his dirty laundry aired out. It is totally believable that he suppressed it back in the day.I very seriously doubt there's anything new in this movie. Probably the same old scumbag shit we've heard a million times, they just branded it as controversial! and what Trump doesn't want you to see! because that's the kind of buzzfeed world we live in.yea, it's 25 years old so I imagine it would be repeated information. It is technically controversial, but most of us have already realized the corrupt shit he has done. It is just relevant again because he is running for president now, and like Richard Nixon said in Futurama Computers may be twice as fast as they were in 1973, but the average voter is as drunk and stupid as ever. So it is good to remind people just how big of an asshole this guy is.This looks like a terrible movie."
"Also, who the fuck doesn't know Donald Trump is a moronic, ego maniacal liar? Hes been dammed from the beginning Trump will not win the election.Whoa, bold prediction!I went back to the futureI just wish he becomes the new president to piss people off :)Seriously.. this guy is batshit bonkers and ruins everything he touches. Remind me again why we want to stop him from representing the GoP? As far as I can tell this is the guy that will inadvertently save us from some far right nutjob actually taking office. I say we support him and keep his hopes alive. This seems like an extremist question, and, well I suppose it is extreme, but I honestly believe this man should be killed if he wins presidency. And I only put that conditional in so I don't seem like a maniac.I like my documentaries like I like my books.  Not over screeching guitar.  Seriously couldn't finish watching the trailer.I _highly_ doubt the released it for free part. The fact that there's not a single competent candidate to be the president is what I find funny. Just how America!Sanders?I want to hear reasons on why he is really a scumbag. Cause I don't know much about him. All that I see in the media is that he can be rude and very intimidating."
"When I see that though, kind of makes me think what if he did win...he would be so feared in congress that they might actually get things done."
"As far as intestinal relations, that could be scary.Look at the Schwarzenegger and Venture governorships. The outsider who comes in to get things done has a steep learning curve in becoming receptive to compromise. I doubt Trump would be happy in any leadership position where he has to compromise and seek consensus.Seems as objective as 'Blackfish'.  LOL."
"Funny how they bring up construction employees.  Yeah.  Because developers hire/run job sites directly.  Its not like they hire major GCs like WebCore or anything.  Its not like there are large scale cost controls on any large project. LOL.people hate him because he's a shrewd, arrogant and outspoken businessman. people like him because he's a shrewd, arrogant and outspoken businessman. What is the point of a documentary that shows that he is a shrewd, arrogant and outspoken businessman?I'd take Trump over another goddamned Bush or Clinton in a fucking nanosecond.  Let's vote for someone who will change stuff. That's what reddit did last time right?"
"And 17 million uninsured people got health care including 70% of the uninsured in California.   That's a pretty big change.Since this election is a shit show let's all vote for a middle ground independent to show that we don't like the polarized party system that's taken control of our country! Anyone in on this? From the film: [speaking of the late '80s] It was a time when celebrities dominated the news"
"Good thing we got past that....I like him as much as I like Bernie Sanders. I wish there was just one, just one moderate president running.Why do I have the feeling that this is just a ploy by the establishment because Trump legitimately makes all of these scumbags in Washington worry."
"I'm sorry, but there isn't a career politician you can get me to vote for. Bernie Sanders is just as much a career politician as the rest of them. I guarantee he can be bought too, and it is no wonder how he is re-elected in one of the most liberal sections of the country."
"I need a career businessman, doesn't even have to be Trump, to win this next election, because I am sick of the middle class being financially slaughtered and destroyed by both Democrats and Republicans alike."
"I feel this documentary is just another attempt at trying to brainwash the american public... You know how you can tell trump isn't rich honestly not even the Interviews or what people say look at the billionaires."
"When trump brings up Romney, Mitt just laughed. While most billionaires know each other and you can see them around each other they stay away from Trump."
"Trump is running to get his brand up and to steal campaign contributions. Big, old money and even big, new money (Gates) NEVER speak of their bottom line. What you would get is a sly chuckle and something along the lines of oh, I don't know...."
"The fact is - they don't. They know a ballpark number but their exact wealth changes day to day sometimes, hour to hour, depending on the market, investments, etc. They don't invest only in this county, they have worldwide interests, that changes constantly."
"They do know they don't have to donkey-bray their holdings to the media, boasting crudely of their so-called wealth. Real money stay quiet."
"Trump is a complete blowhard and buffoon.A dead mob associate has a casino comp card in his pocket and that is considered a mob connection?  people who support him as so ignorant"
"http://www.publicintegrity.org/2009/03/20/2919/corporate-bankruptcies-leave-taxpayers-holding-tab-superfund-cleanup"
"Why are Democrats so intent on sinking Trump now?  Honestly, we should all be talking him up until he wins the Republican nomination, and then release all this stuff. There is no way in hell moderate Americans would vote for him. His nomination would be a guaranteed victory for the Democrats.[deleted]all this is doing is reinforcing him as the frontrunnerDonald Fart. Donald the Flatulent. Donald Stinker."
"These are all the things that instantly come to mind to everyone the other side of the pond hearing his name.He's a lying attenion whoreI feel like this may have a bias On of the things I have learn in my 55 years.."
"You can't teach conservatives...foxghazi and ebola coming over the border got republicans to the polls last election.  Same thing different person.  The GOP has it easy.To be honest I don't think releasing this documentary makes much of a difference because most of the people on reddit are democrats and support Bernie Sanders. Unless this documentary blows up all over the news IMO it won't change much.Smear Trump with one hand and jerk off Sanders with the other.  Reddit, you are nothing if not predictable.Liberals really hate this guy. I think you all are more afraid of him winning cause Hillary is a joke. I actually think Trump is running for the sole purpose of making sure his friends Bill and Hillary Clinton win the election.   You know Trump is for Universal Health Care, single-payer Canadian style?   This whole thing was orchestrated by him to make the GOP look like fools.   He's going to make all the candidates look like idiots during the debates then he'll drop out and become a third party candidate insuring a Clinton victory.Seems like he's a perfect candidate, just like the rest of these vapid, self obsessed criminals.... like Hillary.Too bad they didn't do this for Obama.pretty sure they did.I'm curious who this documentary is for. The people who don't like Donald Trump are already convinced he's a shithead, and the people who support him are more than likely not going to be swayed by this, dismissing it as left-wing propaganda, similar to An Inconvenient Truth. I'm not saying that these documentaries are propaganda, I'm just saying that the filmmakers will be hard pressed to convert any more people into the anti-Trump camp.I'm guessing this documentary wouldn't be made if they hadn't started it 25 years agoThey spent a ton of money many years ago making the film and it never got released so they lost money.  Now Trump is relevant again so they can possibly make some of it back and get some notoriety out of it.  Wow Reddit allowed Trump stuff on the Frontpage!"
"Anyways, that was fuckn awesome because Trump is fuckn awesome and here's what's even better:"
"- the documentary just makes Trump seem even better and more awesome than ever and yet Trump will still sue or own the filmmakers into debt and/or shame."
"Oh silly Reddit, silly liberals when will you learn - **You Can't Stump the Trump!**Hey, I have a documentary about Barack Obama being an America-hating, capitalism-loathing socialist who destroys the healthcare system, quintuples the national debt, trades terrorists for desserters and gives Iran a gateway to nuclear weapons: It's called MSNBC News from 2008-2015. Give it a watch."
"**Vote Trump in 2016!**Please don't treat us like children. Show the whole movie or show us where we can watch the movie. I watched the teaser trailer and I kinda wanted to smack you around because are treating your potential audience like it is a congregation of retards.im going to vote for himAll this trump hate for absolutely no reason. I mean I don't like the guy but at least he's something different. We need a new system.A turd sandwich is different.LOL This makes me laugh.. Your title is so Michael Moorish? Are you a bloated whale who is completely intellectually dishonest too? Trump is driving you libtards crazy, I love it.. Everybody knows the sexy vote is Bernie!It's funny that Trump realistically has no shot at the nomination yet the left of America still fears him enough to start the smear campaigns early.  Honestly I believe what he says really resonates with a lot of people and he's not part of the establishment. Before people especially here in reddit reply racist!!! His comments were taken out of context, and he also had publicly denounced: Bush, Walker, and Perry. People resonate with that as well because they are just GOP establishment republicans. Getting back to the beginning of my comment I sill feel confused as to why the left is so afraid of him. My super right wing coworker wants to vote for him because he tells the truth, and that's why the liberal media is attacking him. Reddit was fine talking about hate speech when it was feminists, gays and gamers on the line. But some rich dentist shoots a lion or some billionaire runs for president, and it's bring on the slander."
"I don't know if Trump is a huge prick or not. I can't imagine anyone accruing 10 billion dollars of wealth while remaining a decent person. At the same time though, I can also imagine a lot of ulterior motives to make one of the wealthiest men alive look worse than he is. But a little consistency would be nice."
"Reddit was willing to lay down it's most basic freedom after John Oliver's harassment video. I hope you realize, any law protecting people from other's saying mean things about them would be used by both people you like and hate.[deleted]You forgot the /s tag. Why did he call you a commie ? When communism is all about power and control to keep the marginalized in check... Whhaaaa[deleted]its ronald mcdonald not mack donald.But nobody really calls me that anymore so it doesn't even make sense."
"But it *is* your name so just pop that name tag on."
"But..."
"*You're gunnu have to pop it on.*I hear Quentin Miller ghostwrote all of his presidential speeches.So, are we joining the anti trump rah rah rah too?So that's where the duck face originated from...Just in time for the debates! This is going to be so entertaining.25 years ago, i was shitting in a diper and?Here we go. The reddit masses are beliiving in everything the liberals feed them. What happened to criticial thinking?Would you contend that these are all lies, or are you satisfied with the way trump conducts business and himself?"
"23 Disney Cameo AppearancesThe implications of Rex collecting dust in Wall-E's bunker, by himself, for centuries........ poor guy.Maybe it's a different one.For what it's worth I think the toys 'die' if they don't get attention for too long, so he probably just got lonely for a while and died.But all the humans have gone, so all the toys don't need to hide."

No one around you to love you and play with you.... Just, there... Geez, this is on my mind as well. What if he is not sentient anymore and became a regular toy? And no one will ever know his adventures with the other toys, and what they were capable of. He's just an object without meaning in the shelf of a robot that's alone in the world. But hey, he won't be alone FOREVER. The humans come back eventually...You basically just repeated what /u/bluepunchbuggy said.Well, we don't see every item in Wall-E's collection. Maybe Buzz and Woody are slightly further back.It's still haunting to know that being set in the future, Andy and even the little girl who inherited the toys, probably passed away a long time ago.

This must be a sad theory so we can all feels.Or maybe... buzz and woody have already been made into boxes.Hammy is seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/phbFcK2.jpg) in the background in front of EVE's face.gonna need a HD-er image for confirmation. That could be anything.I just tried taking playing it on LoveFilm and taking r screenshot on my Kindle, but apparently I can't because it came out as a plain black screen. It's not Hamm, it's a piggy bank or an ornament. There's a closer shot of it at 25:02 (the above shot is two or three seconds earlier) if anybody wants to check for themselves.You're right, it's a generic piggie bank. /u/Aranwaith, dont be all"
"zomg its another pixar reference lolz and shoving lies into others. Thats not Hamm.That's needlessly harsh. He's not shoving lies, he's just been misinformed. The Wikipedia page on [Pixar references](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pixar_film_references) makes the same claim citing a website that uses the same image. It would be a very silly thing to lie about.[here](http://i.imgur.com/J9y5nkF.png) is a zoomed in bit a few seconds after.Yep. Thats confirmation right there.That looks nothing like Piggy. http://puzzles-games.eu/data/media/3/Toy-Story-3-Hamm-Piglet-Box-Wallpaper.jpg"
"His snout is larger. That's not to say he isn't sentient, but it appears Rex didn't have any of his original friends in the group.Yeah the other one looks like he spent an afternoon with sidWell considering they're all mass-produced toys, there's really nothing to suggest that that's even Rex.We can only hope, Internet comrade... Only hope.... It's that or they're all being crushed under a skyscraper of trash.Or sitting atop one like kings!The toy who waitedAt least he wasn't replacedAdd Rapunzel apparently makes a cameo in the new Frozen as a guest at the Ball.It's Rapunzel and Eugene, but not at the ball. They can be seen entering from the bottom left of the screen when Anna firsts bursts through the gates during The First Time in Forever. Rapunzel's in a purple dress with her short hair, but Eugene's in royal wear. You can see them for about half a second, but it's her hair and dress, and  it's his hair and facial hair for sure.[Yup, here's a pic](http://i.imgur.com/3La5GNe.jpg)Wow! Thank you!yay! this makes me so happy for some reason :D it's like they're people"
"Edit: whoa thanks for the gold! :D :))) I know exactly what you mean I wish the Disney version of Rapunzel were real. Hands down hottest Disney princess."
"Too weird?Well rapunzel kinda looks like the frozen girls. Disney version of [This](http://data3.whicdn.com/images/30284942/Siwan-Morris-vs.-Katy-Perry-vs.-Emily-Blunt-vs.-Zooey-Deschanel_large.jpg)I'm a Jasmine kind of guy but Rapunzel is a solid second.Not weird, but I don't know if I can agree with you there. Elsa and Anna were pretty damn hot.Not at all.Because I can *make* it weird.Me and my right hand already did. Like [this](http://imgur.com/GymuF3O)?This comment is adorable. It made me go aww :)I'm not seeing Pumbaa in that Hunchback of Notre Dame picture.enhance He's hog-tied on a pole upside down being carried off by those two dudes at the bottom left, presumably to be eaten or carved up at butcher shop."
"[Also he makes a second 'cameo' later on  in the film as well.](http://joshubuh.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/3a-hunchback-ft-lion.jpg)They say it's him tied upside down, but I can never make it out. It just looks like two guys holding a big stick! Has anyone got a higher-res shot of it?That's not Pumbaa, but an actual gargoyle at Notre Dame. They mentioned it in the DVD commentary that while the one in the Market IS Pumbaa, the one on the cathedral is there in real life. Oh, neat[.](http://i.imgur.com/n9hSRUT.jpg)I enjoyed your period.We all enjoy periods. In the end credits of Finding Nemo they show Mike Wazowski swimmingShrek is in the top left of picture 16. The Snuggly Duckling Scene.There's also the pizza planet car when the fish are going through the escape sequence.What?! Are you serious?Yeah but credits are hardly canonical...How can you not watch the credits on that? They play Beyond the Sea... I freaking love that song. La Mer, actually. Same tune, different song entirely.I'm pretty certain that it was Bobby Darin's version (the most popular one) of *Beyond the Sea*."
"[This youtube clip of the Japanese language version of the end credits appears to confirm this.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rnYmRz3S2Q).Well now I have to rewatch it soon, I am in my head one hundred percent sure it's Beyond the Sea, and now I'm probably wrong.  Crazy stuff. [Here's the video.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivcSKLnl-lY)"
"[And picture.](http://imgur.com/JowLuVy)Oh my God. Holy shit. Monsters evolved after humans. Those films take place far in the future.Wait, what?  How are you getting that from the picture?  Finding Nemo seems to take place in the present and I don't see why Monsters, Inc doesn't as well.Because Fish don't talk in present day, and monsters don't exist ... yet....Doors lead to a different world, human world and monster worlds are different.But they share the same sky. One sky, one destiny...>  One sky, one destiny."
"Kingdom hearts?Go read that Pixar theory linked above. It explains what he's saying. Even though there are humans in both Monsters Inc AND Finding Nemo.I was going to expand: either the doors are time portals as well (most plausible) or the humans also survived, and a separation was made after the civil war that eventually arose, and slowly the Monsters were forgotten to memory. > time portals [...] (most plausible)"
"If you say so, buddy.http://www.pixartheory.com"
"It blew my mind. The only part I don't like about this is the monsters just turn up out of nowhere, it's the one part that craps all over it.Hundreds of years after Wall-E, animals started changing due to radiation caused by BnL. These animals evolved into monsters and accidentally wipe humans off the face of the planet. Monsters University was founded in 1313; this is dated using the monsters' calendar, not the human calendar, and shows that it took place almost 1400 years after A Bug's Life. At Monsters University, they falsely taught the monsters that humans were toxic and from another dimension. This was because monsters were worried about being erased from existence and altering history.holy crap. I remember watching something that basically said they created all of the ideas for the movies at once, this could likely make this theory true. If they did create all the ideas at once (which is likely considering luigi makes a cameo in finding nemo, and cars was released after finding nemo), then there's quite a few more movies that are going to take place between a bug's life and monsters university considering the 1500 year time difference. Also, we should be seeing a lot of movies set in time between brave and the incredibles."
"Bear in mind, this is presuming the theory is accurate in the time differences between each movie.It seems more likely that they reused the car from Finding Nemo as a basis for making one of the cars from Cars, since Finding Nemo came out before Cars did.I don't have the source at hand (I'm at work right now) but I remember reading that a long time ago when Pixar was just starting to get funding from Steve Jobs, John Lasseter and his guys all sat down with Jobs with all these ideas and many of them were the Pixar movies involved in that theory."
"Like I said, I could be wrong. It's been awhile since I read it and don't have the source at hand due to employment."
"Tl,dr: it was pre-planned and waiting for more funding. [He'd make a very handsome throw rug](http://i.imgur.com/z57KmfE.jpg)That's dark, like when Lord Farquad in Shrek turned mama bear into a rug.OooooooooooohhhZazoo!He remembers me!*Zazu.I've got a lovely bunch of coconutsMickey has multiple appearances in A Goofy Movie.[Here he is!](http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxjewjweAb1r337tvo1_500.jpg)The Bug's Life toys in Toy Story 2 is great.[In the end credits there are the bugs sitting on a branch right before Buzz Chops through them.](http://youtu.be/vWclgyyIfUs?t=2m59s)I find it odd that they included that but not the post credits scene of TS2.The skeleton pirate bit confused the shit out of me as a child.Mulan and Lilo and Stich were both created at Walt Disney World's MGM Studios. This is why there were so many referances in Lilo and Stich. To add, Chris Sanders, who directed Lilo and Stitch, was head writer on Mulan, and was the project he worked on previously before pitching Lilo and Stitch.In Mulan, the doll Shan Yu's bird finds looks a lot like LiloI find the Pinocchio one from Tangled both creepy and awesome.Jessie from Toy Story also appears in Monsters Inc. when Boo is showing Sully her toys. IIRC the ball from Toy Story also makes a brief appearance. These ones are always missed from the Disney cameo lists!That ball is from the Pixar short Luxo Jr., and is included in all Pixar films.Like the Pizza Planet truck is in all movies after Toy Story. I love trying to find it.And the text AC113 (I think) which is the name of the classroom in which John Lassetor studied animation, or something along those lines.All movies except The IncrediblesMickey, Donald and Goofy are also in The Little Mermaid."
"Would post proof but on mobile and really lazy. Didnt, someone also post a penis on the cover of The little mermaid?If you guys want a really old-school Mickey cameo, he shows up briefly about 30 seconds into the Fleischer brothers' 1931 cartoon [Bimbo's Initiation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFrBG4xyaF8)."
"[Still frame](http://imgur.com/FGxDnAV).Sounds like a porno. RC out!Yeah, I hear you."
"It's actually a really good cartoon, though. Definitely worth a watch.[Kermit](http://static1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130923144137/muppet/images/7/7d/The_Little_Mermaid_Kermit_cameo.jpg) is in that same scene as well, directly above where Triton's shell starts on the left side. Here's [Mickey, Donald, and Goofy](http://www.moviemuser.co.uk/MovieImages/MAD-Enchanted/mad-enchanted-little-mermaid.jpg)I might be grabbing at straws here, but the really light-skinned guy right above Kermit looks like George Jetson, and to the left of King Triton's crown looks like one of the old guys from the Muppets. Yeah, that is pushing it. The guy above kermit does resemble George Jetson, but it's probably coincidental. Statler and Waldorf (The two old guys) are definitely not the same as that guy near the crown, the resemblance is really vague. Good try though!Holy shit, I never knew about the Kermit one.  That's amazing.He's crossed into a different dimension before he becomes bought out.Well yeah. Donald and Goofy are there with Sora.Is a mermaid in the crowd holding a Mickey Mouse balloon?  Also, it looks like another mermaid is wearing Mickey Mouse ears.  I'm talking about the picture with Kermit in it.Nice catch.I noticed the pet shop in 101 Dalmatians is called Percy's. the dog in Pocahontas is called percymade in VERY different decades. 101 Dalmatians is much, much olderWhy would that matter?  They could still be referencing it.  Pinnochio is a lot older than Aladdin.It could be the other way around though, naming the dog after the pet store.yeah, thats what i meantnow THAT makes senseAre you sure that Luigi appeared in Finding Nemo? Cars came out in 2006, and Finding Nemo came out in 2003.Honestly that one is a stretch.  The car is similar in that it is a shade of yellow, has 4 doors and a sunroof."
"They might still be connected though, seeing as assets like the car model from Nemo could have been reused in making Cars.> Luigi"
"I just wonder if that isn't really Luigi since that car doesn't really look like a Cinquecento.  But that is my opinion.  But it is cool to find these things in movies.  When I was younger it was find the penis tower on the cover of Little Mermaid, and the debris spelling sex in Lion King.  That's what got me thinking, the car in finding Nemo doesn't even look too close to Luigi. Pixar also wasn't Disney until recently. Pixar literally preplanned all their movies in one sitting all together.They planned Toy Story, A Bug's Life, Monster's Inc., and WALL-E. Everything else has been thought up after.Ah, you're right. [Wall-e appears in many places long before the movie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5hI1du-sHQ)Actually that one is fake. I own all the Pixar films and have watched those scenes a million times. Wall-E is in none of them.Huh, I'm now curious, I'll have to go check on this."
"The Wall-E ones are fake That one's certainly a stretch.I believe Cars went into early development in like, 2000. I mean, Pixar does take time with their films and doesn't bust them out in two years.It takes like 3-4 years for them to make one movie An uncle of mine who had worked for Disney Imagineering, I think it was, knew a lot of stuff that Pixar was doing (I'm not sure what his exact job was, but he was pretty connected to Disney's projects) and told me around the time Finding Nemo was out that one of Pixar's next movies would be called Cars and would be about cars. So they plan their movies out way ahead of time and I'm sure they used a concept sketch of Luigi or something to put in Finding Nemo.And Ratatouille definitely came out before UpNot sure why you're getting downvoted because you're correct.The Incredibles also came out in 2004in the ratatouille picture, you see doug from UP. Ratatouille came out in 2007, up came out in 2009. multiple movies are always being worked on, and pixar films take a long time to create. SO it's possible for a character to make a cameo in a movie when their own movie hasn't been finished.They plan all their movies years and years in advanced. They've had WALL-E in the works since the 90's.While I'm sure they plan years in advance, I severely doubt they lock down character designs that early. Plus, they already had a 'car' cameo in the Toy Story truck.It may not be so much a cameo, but maybe Pixar reusing an already modelled asset in Cars."
"it takes upwards of five years to do one movie. They have several projects going on at once. They very much do have them that early. Wouldn't surprise me if Mr Lasseter drew some of the cars before even starting the script."
"Most of their movies have been in development for a long time, production is shorter. But I'm sure they've been writing and doing concepts for their movies for 8+ years.As someone who works in the industry, they lock down character designs that early. Ratatouille came out before Up, and that's still Doug. Pixar has a habit of including a cameo of at least one character or object from the next movie being released."
"[The specific references in each movie are listed in the third section titled Movies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pixar_film_references)if you just added #Movies to the url you wouldn't have had to say that.Pixar has been known to tease upcoming projects via on-screen Easter Egg cameos.They usually tease the next movie to be released, not the movie 3 years down the road. 'Usually' doesn't mean 100%, here's an exception. I think they just needed a car for Cars, so they used one they built for Nemo. In other words, it's not a tease of Cars; it's just Pixar reusing an old object in a new movie.The car has eyes.  And creating a cgi model for a car featured in the movie would require quite a lot more detail than one that passes by for a few frames. I bet you can add eyes and detail onto a pre-existing ordinary car model.Sorry, I meant the car in Nemo has eyes. It's brief but I believe they're there. Not quite, every pixar movie actually has one moment in it hinting at the next movie, you just won't know until you see the next movie.  Such as this slideshow showed us, [monsters inc. came out in 2001](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0198781/?ref_=nv_sr_2), but featured boo holding up a [finding nemo doll, which came out in 2003](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266543/?ref_=nv_sr_1), which had a child reading a [Mr. Incredible comic, which came out in 2004](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317705/?ref_=nv_sr_1)."
"Not recycled, used that car on purpose.Right, but Cars wasn't the next Pixar movie after Nemo, so your point is irrelevant.Pixar movies take an average of 4 years to make. There is a three year period between Finding Nemo and Cars. So Cars was already in production by the time of Nemo's release. So it is possible.But it's not even the same car, it's not even close, just look at the windows and detail on the shape of it.  The only resemblance is that they are both a vehicle that is yellow.Pixar has admitted that they recycle old models. For example, they say on the Toy Story 2 commentary that the toy cleaner man is the old man from their Geri's Game short film.That was an intentional cameo appearance, not just recycling old models. You can even see some chess pieces in one of the drawers of his cleaning kit in Toy Story 2.You can call it a cameo if you want, but it's still re-using an old character to save on the time and money needed to create a new one."
"And there's nothing inherently wrong with doing that, either. I find it hilarious that out of every political argument and flame war I've ever been in on Reddit, my most downvoted comments, *by far*, are those daring to suggest that Pixar might actually re-use old object and character designs.  The horror!It's closer than you're making it out to be. It's entirely possible that the designs simply weren't finalised yet, but it isn't completely far off being the same car.Yeah I remember watching a commentary about Wall-E and they said that they had been working on it around the same time as Toy Story but it came out years later. They don't work on their films one at a time and one after the other. It's really more like their always expanding on all their ideas until they have a good outlook and that's when they focus on making the movie. But the ideas are pretty much always there and that's what makes all these cameos possible and likely.The car also has eyes. Why else would it have eyes. The Ratatouille cameo also showed a dog from Up which came out years later.Wall-E has had cameos in many of the previous movies including Toy Story.Incredibles came out 2004, so after Nemo, but they still had the little boy reading the comic. :-)IIRC, Ratatouille (2007) came out before Up (2009), and Monsters Inc (2001) before Finding Nemo (2003)... I guess animated movies have a much longer time frame from start to finish than normal movies, so 2 years before a release they would definitely have all the character art work + dialogue recorded and are then just working on animation."
"Edit: wrong way around!You mean Up came out *after Ratatouille.In the trailer for Wall-e, the people from pixar described a meeting where they dreamed up most of the Pixar movies.Yes! Sorry, my bad.Does anybody else recognize Figment on the shelf in the Treasure Planet picture as well?"
"Figment is from the ride at Epcot in Disney World. The ride used to be so much better until they updated it, now it's horrible. :(I remember the original...sighI miss the Dream Finder.Which time?"
"They updated it TWICE."
"The first update did not have Figment in it and fans were upset, then they did a third version and shoe-horned Figment in it. Yes, I was one of those upset fans. I forgot about the second update with no Figment! Now they replaced [this guy](http://parksandresorts.wdpromedia.com/media/disneyparks/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2fmt123234LARGE.jpg) with [Eric Idle](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001385/)"
"It's just not the same :'(They replaced him with Eric Idle to tie into Honey, I Shrunk the Audience, that's why. Idle plays the director of  science Institute for both attractions. i believe when james comes across the pirate he says a skellington! as apposed to skeleton. i may just be misunderstanding due to the accent.I picked that up too, it's gotta be intentional.Damn, RIP Pumba.Man Lilo's sister was hotIn the Nightmare Before Christmas shot (second to last), one of the flags on the left looks a whole lot like Sid's shirt in Toy Story.came out before Toy Story, so i highly doubt itHave you not been paying attention?  A number of these cameos were characters from upcoming films.Nightmare wasn't a Pixar film, so yes, i was paying attentionI never said Pixar...and it is a disney film.but Pixar is the one that spends several years making their films and has put in characters from movies that haven't come out yet into their current projects. Nightmare wasn't made by Pixar, so that wasn't the caseDude!  Read the fucking comments!  Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, the muppets??  None of those were Pixar either, but they have all been mentioned for having Easter eggs from previous AND future projects!  This guy gets it.The only I didn't really know about was the Snow White witch in Nightmare Before Christmas. Really cool. It doesn't really look like her, imo.Mostly that apple. Yeah it's not even that close if you ask me, check it out. What's with the mop of blonde hair?"
"[Witch](http://static1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110830100014/disney/images/f/f6/Snowwhite-disneyscreencaps.com-8944.jpg)Yeah, I mean The Nightmare Before Christmas was not strictly a Disney production. It was made under Disney's Touchstone Pictures and only claimed as part of the Disney canon pretty recently since it's gained a bunch of cult success over the years so I'm inclined to believe this was more a reference to the fairy tale than a Disney movie nod like the others.[deleted]The Pizza Planet truck is in all Pixar movies. In A Bug's Life, it is seen at a distance parked next to a trailer. In Brave, it is a wooden carving in the witch's hut.[Except for The Incredibles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pixar_film_references#Pizza_Planet).[Here they all are!](http://loldamn.com/pixars-easter-eggs.html)The carpet isn't the same magic carpet in Aladdin. That one may be a stretch. It clearly has a totally different pattern. I mentioned the DVD commentary for Hunchback earlier about Pumbaa, and YES the makers of the film confirmed that the carpet in Hunchback is supposed to be the same one from Aladdin. Now, as for the pattern...going to the commentary for Aladdin, all of the surfaces for carpet in that movie were done using CGI, thus it would be difficult to map the correct surface onto an already difficult shot."
"...I watch too many DVD commentaries.I love DVD commentaries. You learn some very interesting trivia that way.AHh good to know. The second Aladdin picture is also a reference to I Can't Wait to be King from The Lion King. [Rapunzel and Eugene in Frozen. Bottom left](http://i.imgur.com/lkRstyR.jpg)I cant see Pumbaa....[Minion from Despicable Me in The Lorax](http://images.wikia.com/despicableme/images/9/9c/Minion_in_Lorax.png)Not DisneyHe didn't say it was.http://www.pixartheory.com/"
"Cameos or conspiracy?Some of that was pretty clever, but the whole thing with Boo was a hell of a stretch.I enjoyed that, but I think the toys coming to life because of zero point energy is somehow more far fetched than the rest of it.I was just going to go with, you know, the magic. Wasn't that the whole point?Yeah, that really bugged me too. Why not just say magic?My problem with this theory is that it is based on these connections between movies but it only connects a few well, while leaving a lot of them up to time travel and magic, which are generally frowned upon by fan theorists as they can be used to make any plot hole work itself out.I like the idea of a Pixar connecting theory, but I feel that it is a bit premature to make links between all of them whilst movies are still being made. Also, like you said, time travel is cheap as fuck in explaining stuff.Was anyone else surprised by the Tarzan screenshot? It looks really good, much better than what I remember as a kid. Especially compared to the Aladdin screenshot above it.If that's Luigi from Cars making an appearance in Finding Nemo, doesn't that in itself prove the Pixar Theory wrong? If I remember correctly, the theory stated that Cars took place in future and Finding Nemo in the present. Boo also has a Jessie from Toy Story doll.I think that Luigi one is a bit of a stretch, it is just a yellow carZoidberg is in that second to last Nightmare pic."
"Bottom center.Lol I immediately thought that before I could even read the cameo in that picture. I don't know jack about Nightmare so I didn't know it came out before Futurama before reading other comments here. Amazing coincidence. That, or Groening was walking around a creature department and got the inspiration for Zoidberg from seeing that thing. Who knows...It looks like it, but is clearly not. What you're seeing is some sort of liquid melting-man. Jack's hand sticks to him when he pats him on the head. The effect was achieved by exposing the character to hot lights in between frames, in order to give the melting a greater consistency.Um, that monster isn't even remotely close to Zoidberg. Not to mention Nightmare Before Christmas came out 6 years before Futurama started airing.To be fair it is pretty similar, it's like a thin Burton version of him.They're both red. That's about where the similarities end.And they're both bald. And they both have tentacle mouths. And they both have a white shirt over a green shirt.He's a melting mud man. Those are drips, not tentacles."
"How is a man made out of mud similar to a jewish lobster?"
"I'm beginning to seriously doubt that people have seen this movie because when that character is actually animated he isn't even remotely similar.The burtonberg has no tentacles, that's a deformed beakI don't think it's a tentacle mouth. That guy was just constantly melting throughout the film. He's just like, a pile of melty goo, which I suppose could look like he has tentacles. Groening style eyes, too.>[Thin Burton](http://i.imgur.com/yAeE3wc.jpg)You can't say he doesn't look a hell of a lot like Zoidberg in that shot. That's a weird, waxy slime monster thing. He drips and stuff. He does look a bit like Zoidberg when paused though.Rex is between two bowling pins which are from the very early days of Pixar also.  The Renderman (the software that takes a description of the scene and outputs an image after computing lighting, bumps, etc.) examples included a bowling pin and a bump map to give the pin texture.Meh.  I'm not sold on the Luigi one.  I know Pixar tends to include future characters but wouldn't Mr. Incredible have been that character shown beforehand because the Incredibles came out before Cars did?Do the characters get residuals for these appearances? No?It also looks like Boo from Monsters Inc. makes an appearance as a Pez dispenser in Wall-E.[Totoro is in Toy Story 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miQlWn2CZmc&hd=1)Sometimes all these cameo's give me the chills like there is a dark side to Disney/Pixar. Maybe there's more to it than animators having fun.The Pixar Theory is kind of depressing. Especially how it says that the doors in Monster's Inc. are time portals back to when humans were not extinct. Really depressing actually, considering the happy ending to WALL-E.James and the Giant Peach is such an under appreciated movie. It's a pretty popular movie. It doesn't annoy anyone else when Pixar movies are labeled as Disney movies?"
"Edit for clarityWell they are. Sure, they're branded Disney Pixar, but Pixar still has artistic control over those movies, which is why they don't suck (although they have had some ups and downs recently...). I get annoyed when people talk about Pixar movies as if they are just another one of Disney's regular output, because they are not the same. Also why it was annoying from an artistic standpoint when they marketed Merida as a Disney Princess after the fact.Last time I checked Disney pays them money. So yes Disney has every right to brand PixarYeah, as if Disney without Pixar is some hack company. They've only made like 99% of the iconic animated movies out there.Touchstone, Miramax, Pixar, Marvel, and now Star Wars films are all considered Disney. don't forget anything that's on ABC, ESPN, Lifetime, or A&EIn picture 10 you can also see Sir Kay from Sword in the Stone heading the wagon. It looks like all the people on the streets of Paris may be cameos.in James and the Giant Peach the centipede refers to the skeleton as a Skelington. Always thought that was kinda neat.Finding Nemo came out before Cars yet there's a Cars cameo in Nemo...Pixar has their movies planned out years in advance. There's always (or almost always) a reference to their next project.Surprised no one mentioned the [Pixar Universe Theory](http://mashable.com/2013/07/12/the-pixar-theory/)...Which is a horrible theory.YEah, it really is grasping at straws.This is the stuff that makes me so crazy about Disney/Pixar. It's awesome! It's like each movie has a bunch of tiny puzzle pieces that aren't even directly connected to the plot. I love that Pixar hints the next film in each movie, and I always look for the A113 and the Pizza Planet truck. It's like a look and find in a movie.One cool one is in The Little Mermaid. When Triton first appears, Mickey, Donald and Goofy can be seen in the crowd.What order is this?Going to get buried, and too lazy to check if anyone else has already said it but:"
"-The bouncy ball (yellow, blue stripe, red star) that is seen in heaps of the movies, off the top of my head I can remember it being in Boo's room at the end of Monsters Inc. (there was also a Jessie doll from Toy Story), in Toy Story in Andy's room, and it even makes a brief appearance in Bugs Life."
"-The Toyota 'Pizza Planet' delivery ute first seen in Toy Story, is also parked outside of the trailer home in a Bugs Life (the one with the bug zapper) which is the same trailer home (with the same pizza delivery ute) that Randal is sent to in the end of Monsters Inc."
"Those are just two really obvious ones I can think of that weren't listed above."
"EDIT: There's also the garbage man in the third Toy Story, wearing the same shirt design as Sid from the first movie. Some say it is him, grown up, but it's not much of a cameo because it's the same movie. I noticed the James and the Giant Peach one for the first time yesterday while watching. The centipede even calls him a Skellington.That Luigi one feels like a stretch...No, I've seen that confirmed elsewhere.I feel [this](http://mashable.com/2013/07/12/the-pixar-theory/) is appropriate, simply as it serves to use these cameos in a very complex (but fascinating) theory.They forgot to add the wittled pixar truck in BraveConcerning the Monsters Inc one, didn't that come out before Finding Nemo? wha wha whaaaaatAnimated movies stay in production for a very long time. Pixar likes to put in references to things that haven't happened yet.These movies take years to produce, so they don't only work on one at a time. Finding Nemo was well into production when Monsters came out, and character designs are finalized pretty early in the process. Up came out after Ratatouille too, but that's definitely Dug's shadow. And The Incredibles came out after Nemo, but there's no doubt that's a Mr. Incredible comic book.Pumba also has a cameo in Tangled in the same scene with Pinnochio.I swear I've seen this list before :l Some of the 3D ones, and maybe even the 2D ones, seem more like asset re-use. Why take time to make a new model when you can reuse one. Especially since re-using  models like Remy or other important characters means you get a really high quality models, since they probably put a lot of time into them.Pretty sure that the flag behind the picture containing the witch from Snow White has the skull that is on Sids T-shirt in Toy Story"
"edit: SpellingI was under the impression with Pixar movies they often foreshadow characters from their next movie in productionAll these finds and you don't have the Pizza Planet truck in Finding Nemo?Wow I never knew there were so many. As a kid, the only one that stood out to me was seeing Scar in Hercules and that really confused me.There is also a cameo in Hercules, as he is seen wearing a lion skin toga made out of Scar, from the Lion King.I gotta say a bunch of these I didn't know, thanks! Gotta love Disney and Pixar's easter eggs. I found a whole page on here a while ago explaining the theory of how most of the movies are actually connected in their own universe. Like Wall-E showed the fall of humanity and the rise of technology and that how Cars and Planes got started and blah... And then Brave showed the connection of doors, yes, doors, like from Monster's Inc. It was like the doors were actually portals where you could travel through time, and the Monsters were going back in time. And the witch from Brave found this magic, and used the doors, which is why Merida can't find her after opening the door again. And the witch is actually Boo, probably should have written that first, and the carving is meant to be Sully and she's just trying to find Sully again.Can wallpaper really be considered a cameo?I'm wondering if anyone has collected all the hidden Mickeys in the various animated films?  I've never bothered to look for any, but I always thought the concept was neat.Totoro cameo in Toy Story 3 takes the cake.Woah I forgot about Treasure Planet... Kingdom Hearts 3 better hit that shit up!I've seen James and the Giant Peach a hundred million times, and NOT ONCE have I ever thought that was Jack Skellington as the pirate."
"MIND = BLOWN.Tortoro is seen in Toy Story 3.It's probably coincidental, but in The Nightmare Before Christmas, one of them looks similar to Zoidberg.Some others:"
"1.) During A Whole New World Aladdin and Jasmine fly by the Garden that Megara sings I Won't Say I'm in Love in during *Hercules*"
"2.) Mr. Ray can be seen in Toy Story 3 during the first scene at Sunnyside"
"3.) Geri, from Geri's Game is actually the cleaner from Toy Story 2."
"4.) Mrs. Potato Head is reading *a bugs life* at the beginning of Toy Story 2."
"5.) Al has *a bug's life* mosaic hanging in his apartment."
"6.) Andy has *a bug's life* calendar in Toy Story 2."
"7.) Knack from Knick-Knack (The Short film about the snowman in the snow globe) is in Cars during the Route 66 song in a snow globe."

"[hello](/spoiler)My favorite part about Disney moviesNightmare before Christmas isnt DisneyThen how did I get so much Nightmare merchandise at the Disney store, including the long-limbed princess doll of Sally?Technically it was released under Touchstone Pictures, which is owned by Disney. I only meant technically! :(And I got my picture taken with Jack and Sally at Walt Disney World. And at Disneyland, they redecorate the Haunted Mansion with a Nightmare Before Christmas theme for Halloween through Christmas. So yeah, it's not exactly a little-known fact.yeah it is. Burton was even working for disney when he came up with the poem that inspired the film. IIRC, Disney released it under Touchstone because they thought it was too dark for kids.Boo from monsters inc is in the day care in Toy Story 3According to Lee Unkrich, no, and Bonnie isn't the one most people think is Boo, but another girl that is at the daycare. However, in the scene she is present, she is playing with a blue kitty (which was what she named Sully's in Monster's inc) and expresses ''Boo'' at some point, so its hard to say. But I wish it was her, it would be pretty awesome.Frozen also has a hidden appearance from Rapunzel and Flynn. [wait, is lilo's big sister sleeping naked???](http://i.imgur.com/9BqmodF.jpg)No, right in front of Lilo's nose you can see just a SLIVER of her blue shirt.a couple of those are a little sketchy on dates. The car driving by in the frame for Finding Nemo couldn't have been a car from Cars. Cars came out in 2006 and Finding Nemo in 2003. It's just a car that happens to be the same color. What movie was the first one to start having crossovers? The car from Finding Nemo was not LuigiThe Luigi from cars in Finding Nemo seems to be a bit bullshit for me. The similarities are too vague.Listen to the director's commentary for Nemo... Nifty, I didn't know about a few of thesethanks for sharing, haven't noticed all of these"
"The princess from Fairytale Bullshit is the same as the princess in Cartoon Xerox and its 26 sequels.Am i the only one who's noticed [zoidberg's cameo](http://i.imgur.com/qfHT1SJh.jpg)?"
"That character in no way, shape, or form is a zoidberg cameo. That character is the boogeyman. He doesn't have claws, he's browish-yellow (depending on the light), he's constantly melting, he isn't a doctor, he doesn't sound like his throat is stuffed full of cotton balls, and most importantly the nightmare before christmas came out 6 years before futurama.Thanks for the in-depth reply!I think the carpet ones are reaching a bit. Hey look it's a rug with tassels, must be the magic carpet from Aladdin.Nightmare before christmas wasn't made by disney. And to say the witch who was holding the apple was a cameo from Sleeping beauty is crazy. Doesn't even look a thing like her. She was tall, lean, and beautiful. Not fat and ugly... The fact that they used Jack Skellington as a character in James and the Giant Peach is coincidence because Nightmare Before Christmas wasn't a Disney Movie.Not Sleeping Beauty. It's not Malificent. It's the witch from Snow White when she's disguised as an old woman and gives Snow White the apple.ya i get those mixed up at times... : /Disney produced and distributed Nightmare and Buena Vista, which is owned by Disney, distributed James and the Giant Peach. Henry Selick also directed both movies with Burton producing, it's an intentional cameo.Some seem like a stretch, but pretty cool! I like these... but I mean holy cow this gets posted so oftenI read a fantastic article about the timeline of Pixar movies and how they all have a connection of some kind. Do yall know what I'm talking about and do any of these easter eggs prove or disprove the theory? Ive read something similer crazy stuff The Sultan stacking the animal figures may also be a reference to the Lion King where they all stack up like that during the I Just Want to be King song.Most of these are pretty spot on!  But are you trying to tell me that in Finding Nemo (released in 2003), they referenced a movie that they released 3 years later (in 2006)?Some of pixars movies stay on storyboard for years beforehand. A Movie can be 1-2 years in the making, and its not always released whens its immediately finished.What about mickey, Donald and Pluto in the little mermaid?Maybe Jack Skellington was a crew member on the Black Pearl?[Magic carpet in Princess and the Frog opening scenes](http://images.wikia.com/disney/images/8/85/Magic-Carpet-Aladdin-in-Princess-and-the-Frog-disney-crossover-27362547-559-344.jpg)All these years and it just hit me that Phil from Hercules is voiced by none other than Danny DeVito. Theres 1 frame in aladin where the monkey changes back from the tiger and Mickey mouses head is on him. Will see if I can find the source...Pixar theory!I like how everybody is calling these cameo while all I can see is reusing old models so you don't have to make everything from scratch :) ..What's up with the magic carpet being a different carpet in the Princess and three Frog?[Cracked video on the subject](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ajRI8h1bxs)Wow, only saw this like 3.2 million times before on reddit. Thank you so much for submitting it again!Toy Story was created and, as far as I know, published before a bugs life was even conceptualized, so how are the bugs in toy story? Was the screenshot from Toy Story 2?YesFinding nemo came out in 2003, cars came out in 2006. How could a cars character cameo in finding nemo?It's a stretch but I'm sure they keep the assets they use maybe they just got lazy and reused it? But I agree while reading the list I thought that one was a bit of a leap.Ratatouille was released 2 years before Up.the development cycle for animated movies is roughly 5 years. There would definitely be some cross time in developmentAnd Pixar actually plan their movies out years ahead of release.Pics are too low resolution.I never liked the one in Tarzan , it wasn't subtle enough. It's the first thing you see!"
"The genie-Pinocchio one cracks me up. I mean, he just turns into Pinocchio, it's not really much of a hidden cameo.Well, I'll be...Rapunzel and Eunace(?) Also make an apperance  in FrozenIf anyone is interested, there is actually a pretty big theory regarding some of these cameos. It basically explains that each Pixar movie is connected with one ultimate timeline. Pretty interesting stuff."
"1. [Here is the website that explains this with the help of pictures.](http://www.pixartheory.com/)"
"2. [And here is a video of a guy explaining the theory.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0OTZo3-K5s)"
"If you want to find anymore information, just google The Pixar Theory."
"EDIT: There is also [this website where the theory was originally published.](http://jonnegroni.com/2013/07/11/the-pixar-theory/)that car part is WAAAAY stretching. It's a yellow car. Just that.So, a yellow car drives by and that makes it Luigi? >.<Did anybody else realize that Ratatouille was made before UP, so how could it be Doug?Wasn't Ratatouille before Up? How could Dug have been in it?How cloud mr incredible be in finding Nemo? Or how could Nemo be in monsters inc? It was a teaser for the upcoming releases, pretty much what this whole list was about Does anyone else think that warthog in the Tangled pic (bottom almost in the center) looks like Pumbaa?One thing i find really cool is in kingdom hearts they all have these gems within the planets to!I am confused - no. 12 - nemo in monsters inc - i thought monsters inc came out way before finding nemo did.The Space pizza car (or whatever is called) can also be found when they first discuss the escape plan in finding nemo (it drives by really fast)Pizza Planet!"
"Over priced and underwhelming when I went to Disney World over a decade ago, but I still have a novelty plastic cup somewhere.There is a giant theory  explaining the all the movies at least the Pixar movies are in the same universe I explains why there is a carving of sully in the witches hut because she is boo As much as they are technically owned by Disney.  I don't like counting Pixar films as Disney productions.  Most of the films were originally only published by Disney and have a completely independent production team."
"There are a million easter eggs and cameos in all the Pixar films.  However I am honestly interested in the actual easter eggs in the true Disney films.Didn't Ratatouille come out before Up?Yes. Pixar has a lot of these movies planned out in advance (because they take a LONG time to finish) and so they often like to include cameos for their upcoming films in earlier ones.Thanks, that's what I figured.  Why the downvotes though?Because we hate you![deleted]True, but this version is distinctively Disney.They didn't invent most of their princesses, and you only bring up Pinocchio?A lot of there cartoons aren't their creation.Didn't they use Jack Skellington as the Skeleton pirate in James and the giant peach ?That's the last image in the album"
"21 behind-the-scenes photos of Sir Sean Connery, Jill St John, Charles Gray, Putter Smith, and Bruce Glover filming Diamonds Are Forever in Las Vegas, 1971 (NSFW - some nudity)Awesome pics."
"Still can't believe he wore a toupee in all the bond movies. I really can't tell. Oh wow, TIL. I honestly cannot decide if he was more attractive as Bond in his younger days or as an older man. That white hair... I thought by NSFW - some nudity, there was going to be some bald pictures.TIL Sean Connery wore a toupee in the bond movies.TIL Sean Connery wore a toupee.So did James Macavoy in X-men first classWait what?! He had fake hair?!His toupee was better than Jill St. John's wig at least.Always thought he lost his hair later on[deleted]Huh? That's a hairpiece.He makes for a pretty fantastic bald dude too.Also this was his awkward phase, he became more handsome as he got older.HE WHAT?????!!!!!!!I don't think he wore a hairpiece in Dr No. Definitely seems to be a topic of hot debate. Did a quick google and couldn't find a definitive answer one way or the other."
"No idea what to believe, heh. Sounds like a good excuse for a rewatch! He never took off his sweater to bathe either.Dat man pelt doe.Makeup artists are awesome at that stuff."
"Toupees get a bad rap because most men don't have a team of makeup artists at the ready to put it on perfectly and maintain the toupee all day long.From touching up Connery's hair, to the many faces of Gary Oldman, I'm always amazed at the work of the makeup artists."
"Even in a TV show, the work that goes into the average cut/bruise/scar impresses me."
"As someone who lives in a rainy climate and is starting to lose a fair bit of hair. Other than implants, think I'm rather screwed, heh."
">As someone who lives in a rainy climate and is starting to lose a fair bit of hair. Other than implants, think I'm rather screwed, heh."
"Don't be ashamed of shaving it all off. A clean shaven head looks much better than a balding head.That's like that girls look better without makeup thing. The only reason you think that is because the people who look terrible with a shaved head don't shave their heads. I think the important part is to keep it clean and (preferably) as short as possible. You don't have to go for the cue-ball look, but if you're balding, longer hair makes it seem like you're trying to cover it up."
"I don't think I could ever pull off the Bruce Willis look, but I shave my head with clippers on the lowest setting every week. That keeps it looking nice and professional.he's not saying they look good witha shaved head, they just look better than if they were jus balding. I don't mean to offend anyone but I can't think of a single heavily balding man who I don't think would look better with a shaved headBilly Murray and Jack Nicolson. Jason Alexander, Sean Connery, Larry David. They're not really balding though; they're just bald. The sides just aren't, because it's male pattern baldness instead of their whole heads being bald. Balding is more that in between phase with the long, sparse, wispy hair."
"When people say shave, I don't think they really mean all balding guys need to be Lex Luthor bald. It's more a matter of buzzing it short enough that the bald spots don't have that long wispy hair going on, and it's clear you've accepted the baldness is happening.[Hats. The answer is hats.](http://www.daviddylanthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/henry-jones-166x300.jpg)But the internet is vehemently opposed to any hat that isn't a baseball cap or a beanie. Hats don't always work.  A couple of years ago I was doing the internet dating thing and had a girl stand me up at a restaurant, she was waiting in the parking lot and she saw me walk in wearing a hat and just left.  20minutes go by and I text her to see where she was and she told me that anyone who has to wear a hat on a date obviously has something to hide.  I had sent her pictures of me without a hat and was only wearing a hat because I had been outside all day.  We were to meet just after work and I didn't have time to go home and shower, which she knew because we had talked about that before agreeing on a time to meet.  Anyway, about 3 weeks went by and she texted me Hey there I texted back fuck off  For whatever reason I haven't heard from her since.H.A.T. = Hair alternative treatment Only if you're outdoors...Hattsh. The answer is hattshBrilliant! A fine distinguished look."

"It really works better that way.A lot of things do.Hatch. The ansir is hatch.Hatsh/r/shubreddit Thank you sho much.Goodshpeed.Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd are some of the more interesting antagonists from any Bond film Fun fact (sorta): Back in the 1970s when I used to watch this movie on ABC as a kid, they cut out every bit of dialog or acting that suggested Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd were gay lovers.  I had no idea until I saw the movie uncut on VHS or DVD much later.They [had a cool theme tune, too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6HeJVnOkQ)I watched that movie when I was more or less a kid. Had baaaaaaaad dreams about coffins after that one, I am certain!"
"And they were the inspiration for villains on Kids Next Door!The If at first you don't succeed Try, try again Mr Wint is one of my favorite lines in the movieMr. Wint is [Crispin Glover's dad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Glover). For some reason I always just assumed Crispin's pops was this guy http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Glover"
"Are any of these Glovers related? Yes. Danny Glover is his brother.Me and some friends were working our way through all the Bonds on Saturday nights, when we got to this one we all were having a laugh at how much this guy was acting like Crispin Glover, and how comically out of place it was.  We were blown the fuck away when we realized it was his dad.They should totally get Crispin in for one of the new films. That'd be amazing. They should reprise Wint & Kidd in the rebootThe final scene of Diamonds Are Forever is so Bond it's almost farcical. And what I mean to say is that it's one of my favorites."
"Instead of just shooting Bond when he's defenseless in a hotel room, they instead serve he and his paramour a romantic meal. The dessert is called la bombe surprise and is a bomb disguised as a cake."
"Although Bond has never seen Kidd or Wint, he smells a rat, quite literally, as he recognizes Kidd's aftershave.caught in the claret snafu of course.  and once the one goes out the window (Kidd is it?) the other just starts shrieking bloody murder, pretty entertaining.Doesn't one get ignited by burning kebabs?"
"They have some of the best lines. Perfect psychopaths.They were definitely unique for that era, too. The whole homosexual assassin persona I'm sure ruffled some feathers and made people cheer for their grisly demises.It's a little heavy-handed as the gay hitmen are the antithesis of the dallying alpha James Bond, but they are at least shown to be pretty effective (until it comes to Bond at least...)Indeed, the old scorpion down Dr. Tynan's shirt was a real slick move. :p"

Googled it, and sure enough...Holy shit! TILTIL the gay henchman in DAF is George McFly's dad."
"Today was a good day.Mr Wint and Mr Kidd, the two assassins in the film, are referenced in [The League of Gentlemen series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_League_of_Gentlemen) by BBC as the two surveyors who come to Royston Vasey to build the New RoadI edited the Moon Golf Behind the Scenes shot of Sir Sean Connery because people wanted one for their desktop."
"http://imgur.com/a/A4tzqWas promised nudity. Sean Connery is clothed in all these pictures. Quite disappointed."
"On a more serious note, thanks for these pictures they are pretty cool. The golfing on the moon one is really badass. ~~Actually, he's quite naked in the tub. The second tub shot, in B&W, if you look below the water, you can see he isn't covered. Just he isn't flashing any of his luggage.~~He's wearing a light colored (likely flesh colored) speedo.It's great how little Connery cared when he was making this movieHe was cashing a fat paycheck yo.Something like 1.2 million, right? Finally got the upper hand on CubbyOh yeah, he was pretty much done with Bond by then but just wasn't getting very many good roles.  Cubby was desperate after the Lazenby debacle so Connery had all the cards.  He had a great dispute with the producers on what he made. Not much."
"Today, he'd have a nice chunk of the gross.I think his salary on Diamonds Are Forever was pretty much the biggest pay a actor/actress had ever gotten at the time, they were just that desperate to try to save what they thought was a sinking ship of a movie series."
"Glad it was made though, as Live and Let Die is so darn good and probably wouldnt of had the same feel if it was made just a few years earlier.I was talking about his whole run as Bond. His holdout on HMSS made them pay up for DAF."
"He still thinks he was underpaid as Bond. He's right.There's a pretty good story behind that in the bond documentary on Connery leaving because of the money and coming back after Lazenby. Everything or Nothing? I love itSean Connery. Nice to see a man rocking the body hair without giving a fuck.Objectively, this is a really terrible movie. The performances are suspect and the plot is paper thin. And they manage to ruin Blofeld by putting him in a dress. And subjectively, I really prefer the more serious Bond films."
"But dammit, I just love watching this movie. It's so absurd, with so many bad production and directing decisions, that it kind of works.Nope, sorry, this is my favorite and I can't agree it's a terrible movie.  Precisely -because- it's Sean Connery but also as campy as the Roger Moore films to follow.  And it's got miles and miles of old school cool:"

"My personal favourite is the scene in the alley where the car enters on it's right wheels and exits the alley on the left...Practically Shakespeare when compared to Dean Martin's Matt Helm movies.I love the silly Bond movies! This is why Moonraker is among my favorite in the series -- that to me was the one where they truly just jumped headfirst into the deep end on the crazy pool, and the result was glorious."
"The only Bond movies that I deeply dislike are the late 90's/early 2000's ones where they decided to try and make them edgy and dark again, but also forgot to not make them silly, resulting in inconsistent and unwatchable messes. It is really a shame, because Pierce Brosnan really made a fantastic Bond, but the movies he was in were fucking terrible...*I guess Christmas came early this year*"
"Fucking cringe Die Another Day would have been much better if it didn't take itself so seriously."
"That said, the three Craig films are really where the Bond films should be tonally. The really bad films are fun, but I'll take a Bond film that is coherent any day of the week. I respectfully disagree completely. Goldeneye, TND, and TWINE are masterpieces."

"Die Another Day was completely crap- I'll give you that. Having the main villain be a North Korean guy who gets tossed off a cliff (didn't die) who then morphs (because he wears a rainbow emitting mask with side effects being that he doesn't sleep) into a swordfighting-trained, skydiving, ginger Englishman with an ice palace and diamond empire was less annoying to me than the forced Madonna cameo.I personally feel that Brosnan's Bond films decreased in quality starting with *GoldenEye* as one of the best and ending with shit-fest *Die Another Day*. However, Brosnan's Bond characterization became more polished with each film IMO, and the two films in the middle definitely had a lot of excellent parts to them."
"> Die Another Day was completely crap- I'll give you that.

"Let's not forget they also tried to force Halle Barry into a Jinx spin-off before both *DAD* and *Catwoman* tanked her career. Less annoying than Madonna, but totally forced. (Their brief sex scene in Cuba was pretty hot, though.)"
"**Edit:** The promising part of *DAD* that I *did* like was the concept (not necessarily the execution) of the opening scene, title sequence, and Bond as an outcast in the intelligence community. It's something that was done excellently in *License to Kill* before and decently in *Quantum of Solace* after. Bond's torture sequence during the titles was groundbreaking; they'd never directly been a part of the plot before or since. (Although, the irony isn't lost on me that as Bond was tortured, we were as well thanks to Madonna's theme song.) Bond having to meet ~~R~~ **new Q** in an abandonned tube station was great, but once the ~~Vanquish~~ **Vanish** made its appearance, the film took a nosedive for me.Yeah, I don't really get all the Halle Barry hate. There is so much else glaringly wrong with the movie to focus on."
"She played it pretty well IMO. Their banter in Cuba over mojitos was a little stupid, but thats par for the course with any Bond girl interaction. Wai Lin from TND just set the bar too damned high as a Bond girl that could hold her own in brawl. I don't necessarily hate her performance. Like I said, better than Madonna, and probably one of the better performances in the film. I just think it was gimmicky to set up a possible spinoff, is all. She's a great actress, but I'm not sure the draw would've been there for an all-Jinx film, is all."
"> Wai Lin from TND just set the bar too damned high as a Bond girl that could hold her own in brawl."
"And then Denise Richards lowered that bar substantially in *TWINE*."
"Jokes aside, I actually really like *TND*. I also like that the only romantic contact between Wai Lin and Bond came at the very end. I don't recall too many of the main Bond girls being that chaste. I'm no prude, but it was refreshing IMO.I'm with you on all of this."
"Olga Kurylenko also didn't fall under the Bondspell, but that was more recent and necessary (given the film's focus on his coping with the loss of Vesper).> Olga Kurylenko also didn't fall under the Bondspell"
"It really is a spell, isn't it? Anytime Bond walked into a room in the old films, you could practically hear every attractive woman's panties hit the floor. While Bond does get his share of ass in the new films, it's definitely more realistic while still maintaining his machismo."
"Olga is a good one, and I enjoyed seeing the human side of Bond grieving over Vesper's death. Very reminiscent of *License to Kill*, but replacing Felix Leiter with Vesper and the bromance with an actual romance. It was annoying that the *Quantum* storyline was left in an awkward place after *Skyfall* deviated from a possible conclusion, because I was really looking forward to them meeting again and having the film fill in all her adventures in between. Maybe *Spectre* will try to bring everything together, but I'm not holding my breath.I know! Finally Bond was a bit more relatable...we never really got to see him properly grieve Tracy back in the day- this was a nice change of pace."
"We've all been through shitty breakups. It was great to see him go from:"
"1. Making careless mistakes due to his rage/lack of focus."
"2. Getting wasted on the plane."
"3. Finally finding acceptance and handling it like a badass."
"For once Bond was fallible. Skyfall just built off that same connection the audience was finally forging with the character and ran with it (making it arguably one of the best Bonds of all time).> It was great to see him go from:"

"> 1. Making careless mistakes due to his rage/lack of focus."

"> 3. Finally finding acceptance and handling it like a badass."
"I argued these points about *Quantum* to anyone who'd listen when it came out. I even wrote a lengthy defense on CNN's iReport back in the day and was contacted by someone from CNN about my stance. I think history will look back kinder on *Quantum*, though I will argue it's the weakest overall of the three strong Craig-Bond outings to date."
"> For once Bond was fallible."
"A very succinct way of putting it."
"> Skyfall just built off that same connection the audience was finally forging with the character and ran with it"
"It also twisted the fallibility around so that it wasn't so much on Bond, but on *MI6 as a whole*. From Moneypenny shooting him off the train in the opening to having to evade Silva's barrage of physical and digital attacks to the ending, Bond (though weakened from living off the grid) was probably the least-fallible person or organization in the film, the only hope when the world is crashing down around him and M. Which is why I agree that it's"
"> arguably one of the best Bonds of all time"
"To me, it's in my top 3 of all time, and my favorite of the new ones.*Die Another Day* was fantastic until he escaped. So maybe the first 10 minutes or so."
"We'd never seen Bond tortured like that before and undergo such a transformation."
"But after that it just went to hell."
"My understanding is that the director was undergoing some personal issues which just exploded at that time, and it may have had something to do with it.Atrocious movie, best sword-fighting scene I'll ever see. I think you need to add the amazing tank chase through Moscow to that list...Couldn't agree more- that had to be in the top 5 Bond chase scenes of all time. It's making me want a Carlsberg just thinking about it.My favourite exchange is Tiffany Case's YOU JUST KILLED JAMES BOND! and Bond pretending to be astonished. Is that who that was?!ISSSH THAT WHO THAT WASSH?!"
"It might be the worst line reads in the whole series. (Notwithstanding Halle Berry.) /r/oldschoolcoolThat was a lot of scrolling for a little nudity."
"#neversurrenderBrad Pitt is the 11 years older now than Sean Connery was in these pictures."
"EDIT: more time has passed than my brain wanted to admit. thanks to /u/timholmescorporation for pointing out my mistake.nope today's brad is 11 years older than Sean in these pictures.I actually heard my brain creaking as I tried to assimilate that bit of knowledge. Damn, I am old.You know whats better than titties.... me neither. [This one](http://i.imgur.com/3UmHSFL.jpg) made me feel funny feelings. And I'm straight.Back when men could have chest hair... Would that I were alive back then, I'd be a fucking stallion.Nice subjunctive.I don't know where you live but I'm pretty sure, wherever it is, you're allowed to have chest hair now...Scott Walker made it illegal claiming it was costing the state millions.not against Bond you aren't ;)What makes you think this is my first time?[deleted]http://www.cracked.com/blog/5-bizarre-outbursts-by-celebrities-you-thought-were-sane/He was bad ass. I bet he got so much pushy back in the day.She wash a lovely woman, she just needed a good shlap now and again.While this movie has some pretty great scenes and a bit of camp charm to it, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it as being someone's first Bond movie."
"It's not a bad flick, it's just that there's things in it that might give someone the wrong impression of the series due to some of the stuff being a little out of the ordinary. I haven't read or heard every single thing about this one but I know there was a sort of looseness done with the film because when they were originally getting everything together they weren't sure if they'd be able to get Connery back and were kinda leaving it open to test other actors in mind."
"Also fun fact, one of the Slumber Co henchmen is a young Sid Haig."
"Connery had probably seen so much tit at that time in his life that he was bored.Original rocker of the dad bod.Still one of my favorite movies of all time.  I blame this movie for my eventual addiction to anything Las Vegas and also my gambling problems...brb gonna go play some more crapshe is still the sexiest bond"
"Cut Sean has a boner againIs it wrong that when you described some nudity I was hoping it was Sean Connery?There is something about Sean as a young guy that weirds me out.  I'll always think of him as his character from [The Rock](http://www.virtual-history.com/movie/photo/d01/large/0796.jpg).

"OhYeah.jpgI'm not going to lie, Diamonds Are Forever is my favorite Bond movie. I particularly really like Mr. Kidd and Mr. Won't, though I know that isn't a popular opinion. The opening of the movie, as they knock off the other people involved in the diamond smuggling scheme, gives me slight chills every time I watched it. And I love how they both are dispatched at the end, especially Mr. Kidd. I've always thought that Jill St. John was incredibly and so is the other girl (I can't remember her name, but she's the one that gets thrown out the window into the pool). Blofeld is obviously the best Bond villain not named Goldfinger. What I liked about his plan in this one is that it is *just* over-the-top enough to be unrealistic, but also slightly possible at the same time. Bond movies are the best when they're grounded in some amount of reality but slightly ridiculous. Great pics, but still the worst of the Connery bond films imo.Ah Diamonds Are Forever, this movie picked up right off the heels of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, which might be the highest or lowest point of Bond at the time depending on how you view the franchise."
"Would argue that Diamonds Are Forever is kind of the odd duck of the series. Aesthetically pleasing, but certain aspects of it just feel off. Having Sean Connery come back visibily aged out of his suave 60s Bond look, and also returning to top-ripping-woman-choking Bond that felt off(for me personally) after getting a more emotional and vulnerable Bond in OHMSS via George Lazenby."
"Also Blofield is also off as he's now full on camp, though we do get a early movie explination to his face swap using plastic-surgery magic mud to mold his face into a new one along with Doppelgangers(that mud is all mashed potatoes in the beginning scene if memory serves right)"
"It's not the lowest point of the series(I'll take old Connery over old Moore) but it's sure weird."
"And oh yeah, one of the henchman that chuck Plenty O'Toole out a window later shows up as the mook that gets killed by Scaramanga at the beginning of The Man With the Golden Gun. I'd like to think it's the same henchman who had some untold history of hits and hired jobs. Charles Grey also shows up in You Only Live Twice and I remember there were always theories that was Blofield the whole time, but the Director outright said he casted Grey in the role in DAF just because he was a pleasant actor to work with.Jesus Christ that chest-rug is magnificentI love Sean Connery, loved his Bond movies, and I feel like how he portrayed Bond is exactly who Bond should be.Thank you. Remarkable collection.came in hoping for connery nudity...TIL at the height of Sean Connery's sex appeal he had a dad bod. Thank goodness for the modern objectification of men. Daniel Craig any day all day.James banged them allI'm sorry, but they just do not make movies like that any more.And thank God for that.Dont know why you were downvoted."
"This Bond film is up there with the worst for a variety of reasons."
"It just blindly followed a formula. The creators didnt seem to know why or care about the inner workings of this bond formula."
"Its just so forgettable. Die Another Day is almost objectively the worst Bond movie, but I'd rather watch it over Diamonds any day. At least DAD was entertaining in a terrible way. DaF is painfully bland and uninspired. Connery phoned it in.Sean Connery's so cool. I love the way he says it's ok to beat women.Like Floyd Mayweather, then - hands up everyone that helped pay him the other night.No Mayweather actually beats women.  Connery is just okay with slapping them.  However unpopular it may be to say so, there is a big difference.This is true - Connery slaps them when they're hysterical, Mayweather beats them when they disagreeDon't know why you're being downvoted; [shit is totally true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0d1zTAFKA).Sean Connery beats his wives.

"That basically tells you all you need to know about their respective portrayals of Bond.Damn. These are some cool photos.I haven't seen this movie, but who's in that cremation urn he's holding? Diamonds are in the urn. you should be asking a question of what rather than who. i'm not going to give you a direct answer because i don't want to spoil the movie for you. I won't be seeing it for a while, I appreciate the consideration, but by all means spoil away. diamonds That bastard barnone spoiled it...Pics 14 and 15.It's just a jump to the left.....One of my favorite classic Bonds.

"In fact, no wonder he's so cantankerous now, he probably misses days like that.Absolutely love old James Bond moviesAND YOUR MOTHER CURRENTLY SITS ON MY FACE TREBEK!I know Goldfinger is supposed to be the best Bond film. But Diamonds is by far my favorite. It's so camp. Only got thru half the album.

What an amazing life that guy has lived. 2nd picture.  Yeah.  They banged.Was I the only straight guy disappointed to not get fuzzy Connery ass?Sean Connery is such a beast.Sean's just all like, Shecksh!So cool.  Notice how Connery never seems distracted?  He's interacting with other people, looking at clothes, engaging in life...  I bet if we saw behind the scenes photos from, say, Quantum of Solace, we'd see Daniel Craig locked into a smartphone and, frankly, not available for pictures anyway.  Our stars in the 21st century don't seem to have the same zest as the people in these photos."

"To anyone that doesn't believe me, it's now a pretty well known fact that Connery was already going really bald before he was cast as James Bond, and in all of his Bond movies he was wearing a hairpiece.I predict the death of Sean Connery with in ~~86~~ days."

".Life goals So I was definitely hoping some of the nudity involved Sean Connery. Damnit. In picture 14 and 16 Sean looks like the stone cold pimp that he is. So... Much... Hair... So many! Goddamn I hate the hairless days. How do I James Bond?The names Bond, James Bond. Such a badasshuge fan of bruce glover.  more a fetish than anythingRobert Wagner was married to Jill St. John and Natalie Wood (Lana's sister).  According to Wikipedia..."
">In early 1982, Wagner began dating actress Jill St. John. After eight years together, they married on May 26, 1990. In spring 2000, a Vanity Fair cover shoot featuring all past actresses playing Bond girls in every James Bond film was broken up after an encounter between Lana Wood and St. John. (The two women appeared in Diamonds Are Forever in 1971 but had no scenes together.) St. John reportedly refused to participate if Lana Wood was involved with the Vanity Fair piece, and it was St. John, reportedly, who caused the problem at the shoot."
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_WagnerGod I hope being really hairy comes back in style.Connery was such a fox but that's a dad bod if we've ever seen one.My favorite Bond film, but why no pictures of [Bambi](http://www.wearysloth.com/Gallery/ActorsL/42041-4972.gif)?Did someone mention sloths?"
"Here's a random fact!"
"It typically takes about a month for a sloth to move one kilometre.70's rocket tits were hilarious.I had drinks with Pussy Galore a few months ago--Lana Wood. She was delightful. Tiny gal. Gave me her email address.Look at that gorgeous.... microphone in number 10.Can you imagine how much pussy Sean got those days. He could probably walk into most rooms and just point at a girl.Film grain is beautiful. seems like we DID have the technology to fake the moon landing back thenWhen I saw Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd for some reason I thought of Croup and Vandemar.Being famous and rich used to look a lot more classy back thenI just found the first cool guy with hairy shoulders."
"Wonder how much schecksh he had with those dancing girls.all of itPROOF THAT THE MOON LANDING WAS FAKE Came for the nudity, stayed for the class. Oh!  I love the next to last pic.  So sexy.Oh lord, I had high hopes for the NSFW warning to be for Jill St. John boobery, but alas.Diamonds are Forever was definitely a full out fun Bond. I don't see how some people dislike it.I came for the nudity and stayed for the possibility of more nudity He's a heart beast of a man [?]*Oh James*My favourite picture is when he's picking the suit.One of my absolute favorite movies in the world!"
"Also, Plenty O'Toole. Favorite Bond Girl."
"I always had an issue finding women in older movies attractive, not with that one though.This just proves the moon landing is fake.Jill St John is my favorite Bond girl."
"Robert Wagner had good taste in women.He certainly slept through the performance on this movie."

Bruce must be Crispin's dad.CorrectImagine *young* Sean Connery with a beard, like a full on no holds bar type beard...Coolest motherfucker alive.All these comments and the only thing I want to know what that camera is.

He's funny, he has gravitas, he can play almost any role with equal skill and joie de vivre.  His only mistake?  Trying to indirectly follow Sean Connery.  Once Sean Connery has done something, it's DONE.  Don't even try.For the next Bond, they really need to find someone like Sean Connery."
"Someone who can pull of the aristocratic-alpha-male-tough-guy charisma, who can duke it out with the best of them in a fist fight yet can turn on the charm when he needs to."
"IMHO it's the only way to bring the magic back - Bond after all is a sort of vicarious entertainment.Connery is the ONLY Bond. Other people can play the role, but he will *always* be Bond.Might I introduce you to Daniel Craig?IMHO he is physically fit enough to be a convincing tough guy but can't quite pull off the aristocratic, suave aspect of the character."
"He is like the opposite of Bonds like Brosnan who nail the suave aspect but not quite the tough guy aspect.That's why they rebooted the series and changed things around a bit."
"It's really the only way to do Bond. Every ten years or so, you have to find a new actor as the times and technology and attitudes ALL change. Your choice of Bond has to reflect that.May I present to you:"
"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1055413/?ref_=tt_cl_t1"
"Fassbender, he would be perfect. He has that classic british feel to it. The acting chops as well, a modern day connery."
"His audition:"
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wi56qcTDtfEFun pics, but a truly horrible movie.My wife and her family love love love Bond films.  Aside from the recent ones with Craig, I can't recall watching any that I didn't think were terrible.  But, it has also been decades since I've watched any of them, so very possible that a few bad memories have spoiled the whole genre for me."
"What would you say are the 'good' Bond films, if any?Good is sort of a relative term when it comes to Bond films; they are what they are.  It's like saying McDonald's is good food.  It ain't, but you know what you're getting when you pull up to the drive-through."
"That said, I think some of them are pretty good:"
"- Thunderball"
"- Goldfinger"
"- The Man with the Golden Gun"
"- The Spy Who Loved Me"
"- Licence to Kill (Poor Timothy Dalton.  This is better than any films Pierce Brosnan did)"

"20 photos from the making of Leon: The Professional (1994), featuring Jean Reno, Natalie Portman, Gary Oldman, and writer/director Luc BessonGary Oldman's performance in this is one of my favourite characters of all time.He ruined my suit! after he got shot. He's one of the craziest movie characters I know.Gary Oldman is one of my favorite actors of all time. Seems like a fucking blast to hang out with, too."
"And he keeps getting paired with some of my other favorites, like Jean Reno, Morgan Freeman, Tim Roth... If I could get him in something with Edward Norton, Johnny Depp, and Michael Keaton, I'd be in movie heaven. The character seems really difficult to play. If he seemed a little more sane it would seem comical in the absurd things he does in the movie. I think he balanced just the right amount of seriousness with insanity and sillyness (the way he walks through the beads, talking about Beethoven etc.). Ever since I saw the movie, I find anytime I pass through curtains/beads/etc, I have to do it in Stansfield mode.So few movies / actors so perfectly capture that moment when the villain realizes he has been utterly defeated.Unreal. It's strange this post was today as I only watched Leon (again) 2 days ago after coming onto Netflix. Fresh in my mind, his mixture of crazy, arrogance and disdain is just unbelievable.He's my favorite actor, but he's such a chameleon that *I keep forgetting his name*.**EVVVVVVREEEEEYONNNE**http://i.imgur.com/azQrPXe.gifi didnt want to sleep anyways...this gif always freaks me out[He was in an ad for Subway](https://youtu.be/_uIBcgNh4mU)Yeah... but it's not like it was a role of a lifetime or anything."

I'm going to have to watch this movie. There are a lot of little subtle things in that film. Notice how Dennis Hopper asks for the cigarette right when he realizes he's about to die. He knew he was dead, it was just a matter of how long it would take for them to kill him. He didn't want to break under torture, so he asks for his last smoke and decides to piss the Sicilian off enough to just shoot him outright, sparing him from telling him where his son is."
"It's one of those films that gets better every time you watch it.No thanks? What does that mean? Means you ate before you came down here? All full. Is that it? Naw, I don't think so. I think you're too scared to be eatin'. Now, see we're sittin' down here, ready to negotiate, and you've already given up your shit. I'm still a mystery to you. But I know exactly where your white ass is comin' from. See, if I asked you if you wanted some dinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down, I'd say to myself, This motherfucker's carryin' on like he ain't got a care in the world. Who know? Maybe he don't. Maybe this fool's such a bad motherfucker, he don't got to worry about nothin', he just sit down, eat my Chinese, watch my TV. See? You ain't even sat down yet. On that TV there, since you been in the room, is a woman with her breasteses hangin' out, and you ain't even bothered to look. You just been clockin' me.

"Brad pitt's cameo on the couch with the honeybear bong is amazing.  I think this might be in my top three movies. It really is infinitely quotable and eternally (so) cool. Almost any scene in this movie is good enough to stand on it's own.  The movie is just a collection of amazing dialog and really good actors."
"I think it is good because Tarantino wrote the script but didn't direct it so it doesn't have that hokey set design over the top stylized feel to it.Yeh, when he pops that pill and the camera is right above him. It's really intense and creepy! Bollywood reenactment."
"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x15ahj9_ashish-vidyarthi-kills-rani-mukherjee-s-entire-family-bichhoo_newsAmazing! Please tell me there is a subreddit for more Bollywood reenactments!http://i.imgur.com/rKpxP.gifI saw a preview on TV and that scene made me sit up and say I HAVE to see this!! That and when he fires the warning shot at the old lady and tells her to go back inside.  Always cracks me up.  In the movie when Stansfield gives the Beethoven speech, he quips after his openings, he does tend to get a little fucking boring.  THAT'S WHY I STOPPED!"
"I never understood that line until many years and viewings later."
"He pops that pill, and then he literally starts hearing Beethoven in his head.  He rampages through the guy's house, killing his wife and his daughter, ALL TO THE SOUND OF BEETHOVEN IN HIS MIND.  We, the audience, sort of miss it because we're listening to the movie soundtrack instead."
"And the ONLY reason he stops rampaging through the house killing people... Is because he got to the boring part in his head."
"When I realized that, the Stansfield character became so much scarier in my mind, and Gary Oldman's performance that much better."
"Also:"
"The Professional (2/8) Movie CLIP - One Minute Pa...: https://youtu.be/eRBI1VSO7hc"
"I got it because he dances and waves his hands. In his mind he hears it.My favorite part about that scene is when he casually walks across the hallway and his henchmen dive to the floor in fear. Even his own men are scared to death of him when he goes on these drug-induced rampages.I think that's more because they don't know who is coming out of the doorway rather than fear of Stansfield shooting them.>video not availableI always imagined that the action was actually choreographed to a recording, because the camera work for that scene is so tight, it's almost unreal. Check the scene, and it looks as if the camera and Oldman are joined together in a dance. It is an outstanding piece of work and that whole piece is terrifying, tragic, but whimsical. His character's reaction when he discovers the bullet hole in his jacket is magical, all childish and petulant.someone with the ability needs to line up with the beethoven song and post it[here you go friend"
"](http://vmashup.com/WASD84st)Who is that goofy fuck at the end of the Leon clip? I can't believe that they would leave that part in and that it made it past the editor. It adds nothing to the movie and was a poor choice by the Director.Urgh, tell me about it.  You should see the Director's cut, there's about twenty minutes of a cat playing with a cardboard box, and a kid on a skateboard hitting himself in the nuts.WhoahNice catch. Another cool side bit is that the same year, they released a movie Gary Oldman starred in named Immortal Beloved. The character he played...Ludwig van Beethoven.Also he played the piano himself.I'm not surprised, Oldman is a chameleon. Seriously, how many actors out there have the chops to pull off a convincing performance as a piano?I have to post this when Gary Oldman comes up."
"https://youtu.be/CIaWo-BlBjs Absolutely two movies worth watching. and...It was Oldman's preparation for Immortal Beloved which led to the creative team going with Stansfield being so fixed on Ludwig. It was convenient to the fact that that was what Oldman was already immersing himself in.Since we're talking about influences regarding Oldman's performances. Willi One Blood or the Guy/DEA agent with dreads, influenced Gary Oldman's character Drexl Spivey in True Romance.Just thinking about Natalie Portman and French actors and I was thinking. If Natalie Portman and Audrey Tautou got together as a couple (Lord Please) their Portmanteau would be Portmantou"
"EDIT: Thanks for the Gold!You have a gift.I love everything about this ideaThis is my favorite movie. Natalie Portman.... KILLED it. Just insane when you consider her age at the time. Then you might like [her audition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhRW8J3gTuo) if you haven't seen it yet.I've been told that she actually learned to shoot guns for the role, they actually taught her how to properly handle weapons."
"No idea if true, but if it is I think its pretty cool. I mean she was young, but not so young that it would be odd to teach her how to shoot a gun.Considering one of the photos in this post is a pic of someone showing her how to hold one, you are probably right.> **someone** showing her how to hold one"

Not sure what else but that enough is for me to like him :)"
"Seems very diverse. I remember him as the What did you see old man light guy on the 98 GodzillaNot in France or in Japan. He's also an awesome human being. Here's a discussion he had on a French TV about his life http://youtu.be/gU1i-VdwYrkI thought he was great in Ronin as well, I liked the camaraderie his character builds with DeNiro.Fuck yes. ^^whatwasinthegoddamnbox!?Not in France but he was sadly underused internationally. He is good for comedy as well as dramatic roles.I swear. I watched Just Visiting in which he comes forward in time as  French Knight to modern day far too many times. That is one of the best movies I have watched by accident ever. Great comedy!This is a remake/spin-off of the most popular Jean Reno movies in France, actually! The original (Les Visiteurs) is a classic, but probably not anywhere else in the world.No women, no kids....okayAnd stop saying okay!Okay...With all the famous child actors/actresses going batshit, it's quite understated how well Natalie Portman has done for herselfthose are mostly disney/nick kids, Natalue started out with a very serious and dark film which likely made her look more mature. And here's [Natalie Portman auditioning for the movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhRW8J3gTuo).I cannot stand watching any audition scenes from child actors. With the exception of the [kid from E.T.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA5giyG8E7g)Watching the audition for ep1 Anakin makes you realize what a terrible choice they made Yeah, but that kid is a one in a million as far as child actors go. I doubt Lucas would ever have found an actor that could pull off young Anakin. Hell, even the adults had a hard time in them. What Lucas needed was an older actor with a different director. Or he could have gotten Spielberg to direct, since he is so great with child actors. Wow, that's absolutely incredible. That's just ridiculous.  I'm so impressed/terrified.Damn right he got the job!Picture 13, where Leon is lowering Mathilda into the wall cavity and saying goodbye, oh the feels.Oh yes...that scene was heartbreaking. Portmans acting was phenomenal. Oh god and when Leon says he wants to go away with her...*I want to be happy...sleep in a bed...have roots*...gah"
"Edit: [Scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce6jdrqyW0U)That little girl was  such a talent...it's a shame she was never in anything ever again...She was pretty good in Heat. Sadly, I think that was her last work.She went to an ivy league school, actually, but got kicked out for fighting and fucking. Two depressing white guys wrote a song about it.Yeah that's too bad, I heard the plant made it on to bigger and better things though. I saw him recently in The Happening where he played a plastic plant! Man what an actor... I'm still mad they cut the [sex scene](http://web-images.chacha.com/images/Gallery/5498/who-were-the-least-scary-movie-villains-25236984-jan-15-2013-1-600x400.jpg) with Mark Wahlberg. I think he was even in Breaking Bad!I heard the plant had hit hard times for a while. Thanks to Zach Galifucknuckus for giving him a small part as one of the ferns, in Between Two Ferns, his career started to grow again.I think for how well he started off, it's nice to see him branch out a little to comedy and other genres.The same old tired tale of the child stars who burn their wings and end up in Harvard. A shame indeed.And hook up with dubious characters like the director of dance at the Paris Opera Ballet.Yeah, fell into that former child star disaster spiral...https://vimeo.com/22788248One of my all time favorite films and definitely my favorite [Luc Besson](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000108/) film (yes, I said it's even better than The Fifth Element). As others have already mentioned, watch Leon instead of The Professional."
"It's a shame he can't maintain the intensity of his early career film career, but I guess that's something that happens to most artists over time.It is way, way better than the Fifth Element. And I *love* The Fifth Element, which I've seen way too many times, but The Fifth Element is ultimately a popcorn movie. Leon has much more depth, nuance and feeling. The Big Blue is also fucking amazing.I saw this on Amazon Prime last night and added it to my watchlist. Is it any good?> Is it any good?"
"It's brilliant.  It just popped back on to Netflix this past week and I immediately watched it again."
"It's dark and touching and scary and fun.  amazing movie I just saw it last week. Would recommend. Somewhat odd, but very good.It's fucking amazing.One of my all time favorite movies!One of my favourite movies ever! Watch it, you won't regret it. Very Very well written and well paced. Deep character development and story shape. You'll be engrossed.Yes it is a good movie. Fuck yes.  Amazing.It's frankly one of the best Jean Reno movies I've seen in my life.Awesome movie, Natalie Portmans best performance ever and Oldman and Reno are also amazing! A must see in my opinion!Incredible movie! It was up there to stream not purchase and add to your library?"
"If so, I think I know what I'll be doing this evening. Never seen it..It's great, and I'm not sure why. It's one of those that I love for some odd reason I can't describe. But yes, please watch it. Also, it's better the 2nd, 3rd, 4th time you see it. I would say it's an action movie done right. Most action movies are just noisy nonsense. Films like this (Raiders of the Lost Ark is another good example) always have something insane happening onscreen, but it is always something new and works together with the plot to drive the story forward. Somebody needs to tell Michael Bay that you you don't have to sacrifice a good story for action sequences.This is your plan tonight, no excuses.  Report back later!Definitely my fav movie for all 3 main actors. Natalie Portman, Gary oldman, Jean Reno. I'm 25 now, have been watching it since I was 15, still one of my fav movies. Can't really appreciate Gary Oldman until you've seen this movie. But make sure you have some milk in the fridgeAnd don't forget to do your daily abdominal sit ups.Its also on Netflix now Of course!! And watch Nikita too! In french if you can http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100263/This was the first film I saw Gary Oldman in, he was instantly my favorite actor... he is amazing in this filmYou've probably seen him in other movies without realizing it. Seriously.Not his most famous role, but I was incredibly surprised to find out, after I watched the movie, that he was in Hannibal (the 2001 film).  I had to do some digging to find out who he played."
"[Kind of a disturbing picture if you don't know what to expect, but no blood.](http://cdn.screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/Gary-Oldman-as-Mason-Verger-in-Hannibal.jpg)gary looks old, man...Everyone should see this film... E-V-E-R-Y-OOOOOONE!!I fucking love this film. It shows some awesome character development and Natalie Portman's role is really cool.There are 2 versions, The Professional and Leon."
"The Professional is the US release and what's on Amazon Prime. Leon is the International version and has 24 minutes of additional footage."
"One of the times the additional footage is worth watching. Includes the scene with Matilda and Leon taking out a drug dealer (the tattooed man in the photos).The movie is also on Netflix streaming right now.One of Reno's, Portman's and Oldman's best performances each, and that's saying something. Truly amazing.You can never go wrong with a Jean Reno film, particularly this one and *Ronin*.Make sure you invite some friends to watch it..."
"Hell, just invite ..."
"#EVERYONEI love this movie so much. The acting is brilliant. The atmosphere is super tense and the story is really good. It's from a time when Luc Besson still made edgier movies. Watch it. Just watch it! And make sure to watch the director's cut at all costs. It's much longer and gives a lot more depth and context."
"And as others mentioned: don't spoil anything if you haven't seen it yet. Just watch it."
"I kind of envy you. I would love to see this movie for the first time again without knowing anything about it.EEEEEVVVVVEEEEERRRRRYYYYYYOOOOOONNNNNNEEEEEE!!!! loves it.What do you mean everyone?[**EVERYONE!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJZUTlVBLr8)One of my favorite films. Gary Oldman is FANTASTIC. To be fair, Gary Oldman is fantastic in everything.Don't read about it, don't look at reviews, just watch it. I am jealous that you get to see it for the first time.For real.  14 year old me got the feels for Natalie Portman on account of this movie.  I still think of her as the supreme example of feminine beauty.Same here. I've had a crush on Natalie Portman ever since I watched this move with my dad when I was 13.Funny that's the same time your dad discovered the same...This guy's got jokes.Make sure you watch Leon: The Professional, not The Professional. It has like 20 extra minutes of important character development. It was cut from the us version for being too Lolita-y. There's still a bit of that vibe in the US version so I wonder how much more of it is in Leon: The Professional. [spoilers](#s She literally comes out and says she wants to do it with leon. He is gobsmacked and he doesn't lash out or insult her or even say he doesn't want to. He says he can't because the only other woman he ever loved was murdered because he made love to her.)[spoilers](#s although I always understood their relationship as being totally platonic from Leon's side. so while I get that some people could feel uncomfortable with the movie it's really not take that lolita-y - I mean, just at this moment there are literally thousands of young girls all over the globe having a crush on some older man, whether it be their teacher, coach or whatever. as long as that guy doesn't exploit those feeling it's something that's perfectly harmless and normal)"
"[spoilers](#s I figured he was just trying to let her down gently. I mean, she did just see her family get killed..)[spoilers](#s I just wanna get in on this black text thing.)Anybody who says it's Lolita-y has not read/watched Lolita."
"That shit was off the hook.  Nabokov intentionally plumbed the depths of what he could imagine for the sake of exploring the concept.  It was hilarious, by the way, for anyone who hasn't read it."
"I think that was his way of letting her down gently.  He knew that getting angry or saying how wrong it was could drive her away, and that she would grow out of it given time anyway.  He recognised it for the temporary infatuation it was.  His actions were based on platonic love - he protected her feelings because he cared and didn't want to humiliate her."
"I think that the whole 'pedo' angle has come about a lot more in the last decade or so, when it's become more of a topical subject, or is misinterpreted by younger viewers who take things at face value (or, because she was close to their own age, found her more attractive than intended.  Her playing at being sexy is meant to look more desperate and ridiculous than successful - but a 14 year old boy might well not get that.  Edit:  As a lot of 'I watched it when 13 and got a crush on her' comments below seem to support.)"
"Leon himself is actually a rather child-like, innocent character.  He is the naive one in many ways, while Mathilda is the one who has had an almost exaggerated maturity thrust upon her.  She is sexual beyond her years, and beyond her actual feelings.  Much of it seems based on a desire to act older in order to downplay how much of a child she really is, and how badly losing her family really affected her.  She's essentially overcompensating in reaction to what she has seen.Agreed, her tone was that of a teen feeling they were old enough to do something mature and she wanted to do it with Leon. Wow I'll have to check that out."
"When we showed it on the ship, there was a lot of comments about the lolita-y aspect, less than today of course, but everyone watched the damned movie.  Actually, everyone was riveted by the movie.I have only seen the international version so I was curious as to the differences.  [Here's a link](http://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=1342) outlining all of the differences.Oh wow, never knew that. I've seen The Professional plenty of times. Didn't realize it was a significantly different movieIt's not significantly different, it's just that the extra footage adds a lot of depth.God I love that movie. Some changes were made to the script due to the same Lolita-y feels getting to close to home. In the original script, they do become lovers. Jean Reno also felt that if he made Leon sound a bit slow then both characters would be seen on more of an equal footing and not incinuate that Leon was trying to take advantage of the girl.Actually, Jean Reno wanted Leon to be 'slow' so that Mathilda would be the one emotionally in charge and that's very much the case.  I love Jean Reno and it worked wonderfully.Man, that was a really good call. It's a really different movie without that choice.There's also a Leon with Jean Claude VanDamme. Scrap that one. Leon: The Professional (director's cut) is what you should see.What if I watch Leon, then watch The Professional?The longer version contains stuff test audiences in America were uncomfortable with. As a whole, the additional material makes Portman's character look a lot less innocent. There also might be a slight pedo vibe in the air.I really liked the added scenes of Matilda going out on jobs with Leon tho...Not really sure why those were cut. The pedo vibe is a plot point in both versions.In the original screenplay she seduces him, he cannot resist her advances.She's also a bit older in that version. (Not old enough, just older.) And everyone dies in the end, including her. The whole thing was just unfilmably dark.There's no Vibe... It's pretty overt.  In the international version, she offers hersel to leon, and he refuses on the basis that he's still troubled by a lost love and wouldn't be a good lover.  They end up compromising and sharing a bed together, but not having sex."
"He's the scene...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWIJpw9UJdQ"
"There's also this..."
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoPSQzZ7wbkI remember seeing The Professional and thinking, man they could have totally developed Leon and Matilda's individual and shared relationship more with a few scenes. Then I saw Leon: The Professional, which did just that and exceeded my expectations.> I remember watching the professional back when it first came out and something about it felt off. A couple years later I found out about the whole Leon vs The professional cuts. I had to track down a company that took the French secam vhs of Leon then converted it to ntsc vhs for sale. I sort of understood that Lolita thing, but it neutered the whole movie cutting that stuff out. Maybe a year or so later they finally released the Leon dvd in the U.S."
"Quoting myself from the Leon thread in /r/netflixbestof.  And to add to that, I remember in The Professional, all of a sudden she's wearing his little cap and sunglasses and it just felt out of the blue. In Leon, there's the whole training montage they go through sniping people, then she starts dressing like him. Made so much more sense.Fuck yes, it's fantastic. I read this originally as Fuck you, it's fantastic and I prefer that original reading.You should watch the Big Blue. Can't decide which one I like best from these two. Completely different films, same lead / director.Call the station and tell them to send everyone."
"What do you mean everyone?"
"Shouts... E-v-e-r-y-o-n-e."
"http://i.imgur.com/pYQsnAt.gif[removed]I need bleach[Here](http://i.imgur.com/rGNpfRc.gifv) you go! It's so good I'm gonna have to buy it in yet another format....I really like the look of [Best Buy Pop Art Blu-ray edition](http://smile.amazon.com/Leon-Professional-Project-Limited-Steelbooks/dp/B00Q5J9TM0).I'm really surprised they never made a sequel to this where Mathilda was educated in the world afforded her by Leon's money and connections, and she too, would grow up to follow in his footsteps, taking on the same profession, to honor the man that saved her life.It doesn't hit the same 'genre' notes as Leon, for sure, but I kind of unofficially pretend that Closer is somewhat of a continuation of Mathilda's story - it's still Natalie Portman, after all!"
"I do feel like, after what she went through, Mathilda would be so much more likely to become kind of a 'whatever, whenever' drifter like Portman's character in Closer, especially with that element of I don't need you but I do need you oh god I need you actually I'm bored go away that she goes through with Jude Law's character - lingering Leon daddy issues, anyone? And anyway, I just don't see her going down the trained killer pathway, it feels like the finale face-off would have given her a lifetime fix for violence."
"It would also explain some of the mysterious hidden past element of Portman's character in Closer - after all, Mathilda would have to cover her tracks pretty well until things cooled down, and that might just develop into a lifelong habit of self-reinvention."
"Anyway, it's just my crackpot theory and lord knows it has its flaws, but it fills the sequel-shaped hole in my mind well enough. ;)It would never live up to the high expectations of fans of the original movie.They did, [sort of](http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/olivier_megaton_admits_colombiana_partly_inspired_from_luc_bessons_professi). It was called Colombiana. It was... not as good as Leon.Titled Mathilda no less.I always forget about this movie!  A great child star that didn't go nuts.[Are you sure she isn't nuts?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWW8onRK_GA)Chris Hansen would like to sit me down and have a word with me about how I felt about Natalie Portmans performance in that movie.I'd have to take a seat, right next to you too... [So will the Diablo 1 developers (There was a nice easter egg about Natalie Portman)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/29dpae/decided_to_revisit_diablo_1_found_this_awesome/)I was 12 when this came out and I've had a crush on Natalie Portman ever since. Ah. Thankfully I saw the movie when it first came out and was the same age as Natalie. My feelings at the time were appropriate.Leon and the child like innocence of LeeLoo in the Fifth Element has always had me wondering if maybe Mr. Hansen should have a chat with Luc Benson."
"Edit: Great.  Now I can't watch The Fifth Element without being all creeped out.  Remember the scene where Leon puts a knife to the throat of the Fatman and there's a very young looking girl in the room?"

"At least you get all that sweet sweet karma. Yeah, I just put a downpayment on a beautiful house using my karma."
"Oh wait...To be fair, I follow you on snapchat and your house seems pretty nice, except the scorpion infestation....wait is that creepy? What percentage of your comments are &#3232;_&#3232;?How did I not realize that woman was Diva Plavalaguna?!Maiwenn even says that Leon is specifically about her relationship with Besson.[deleted]Lol. How progressive of you. He was 32 and knocked her up. W/e.[deleted]A 35 year old fucking a 16 year old isn't skeezy to you at all? I mean age of consent in my state (and most of the US) is 16 and I would still call the dude a fucking weirdo. Why would you call someone a weirdo if the sex they are having is consensual? I don't get your point. The age difference is no better than a 40 year old having sex with a 18 year old. [In most of the US, actually.](http://www.ageofconsent.us/)Had a kid with her when she was 16, left her for Milla Jovovich in 5th Element... I'm going to agree with /u/why-the Milla was 22 in 5th Element, though. If wanting to date 22 year olds is being a paedophile, then call me Mr Paedophile. File-Peter@hotmail.comI assume you saw the longer version. I mean, it gets [pretty French](https://youtu.be/gWIJpw9UJdQ).You know, artistically, I think the creepiness bumps Leon into my number one film of all time."
"Other films evoke emotions. But the director's cut makes me question my *morals*, and whether or not I'm a fucked up human being for wanting them to live creepily-but-happily ever after. The playwrights of ancient Greece would applaud that shit.[deleted]I love how Luc Besson looks like he simply walked over from the ***La Femme Nikita*** set playing one of the drug store robbers from the opening and sat behind the camera. Such an amazing movie, probably my favorite Natalie Portman flick, and she makes you feel super uncomfortable because she acts a bit sexual in the movie.M'thilda. \*tips trenchcoat\*Just re-watched last night."
"Love to see a sequel, with a grown-up Matilda working as a cleaner.I've often had this same thought."
"I'd love to see two sequels, actually. Natalie is still young enough to do what I'd like to see for the second one now (it's a shame it wasn't made like... 16 years ago, though) where Matilda is younger and basically gets swept up in the business of being an assassin."
"Then, I'd like to see a third installment with an older Natalie (like made in maybe 7 or more years when she's in her 40s) reprising the roll again where it mirrors the first movie, but with Matilda looking after a young kid (boy or girl, doesn't matter to me) and trying to spare that kid from the same world that's haunted her, just like Leon did originally. Of course, the interesting part is to see what she tries differently."
"Anyway, I'd have loved to have seen a sequel or sequels to Leon.How Gary Oldman has never won an Oscar?This was the 90's awesome fucking equivalent/parent of John WicK.With a bit of sweet stepfather/stepdaughter bonding."
"...How do you call it when a man adopts a girl through assassination, anyway?Currently on Netflix in the U.S.Is the one on Netflix the US version or the international version that didn't have as much cut.Its the US version, not the international version unfortunately.  Disappointed that there isn't a glass of milk in any of these photos. I was really hoping for one to pop in somewhere. For me that's the biggest symbol in the whole movie and I like to think that since Leon has been so cut off from the world he has a sort of child mentality (innocent and naive) hence the milk."
"Anyway I can't criticise these photos, they are amazing. :)> Leon has been so cut off from the world"
"Wow, you just described his situation perfectly. I wondered how he could do this because he doesn't seem at heart that bad. The milk is also a part of Jean Reno history, his father used to work with lead, so he was drinking milk as a antidote. > Leon has been so cut off from the world he has a sort of child mentality (innocent and naive) hence the milk."
"In a way he is more innocent than Mathilde.I love so much how he gurgles milk all over himself when Matilda says she thinks she's falling in love with him"
"Edit: [Watch and giggle with me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJgXB_PkCDY) Doesn't he do that twice? The milk was critical to our understanding of him.*giggles*Are people just now discovering this movie? Its all over the front page recently. Its one of my favorites of all timeI can't speak for anyone else, but I just got done watching it for the first time because of this thread, and holy shit! It was by far one of the best movies I have ever seen. I can't believe I had never heard of it before, either."
"Edit: Just came back to say that I have now watched this movie twice in the last two days, and have discovered and watched Fifth Element as well (why have I not seen that before?!). I think it's clear to say that I am now in love with Luc Besson and Gary Oldman. Thanks Reddit.It dropped on Netflix today or yesterday, I think. I'm pretty sure it got released on Netflix recently, so that'd my guess.Now I see where Adam Levine pulled his look from http://i.imgur.com/H20xeAH.jpgThis is one the few films where, if I'm recommending it to someone, I absolutely tell them to watch the director's cut. In the shorter version there is a ridiculous missing scene that I couldn't believe they cut. One of my favorites. Awesome movie. Jean Reno looks so young. It's weird that this movie is 21 years old.Dammit, now all I wanna do is go home and rewatch this!Yoo....I just realized this is the original THE LAST OF USEasily top 10 best moviesEven the technical details of this movie are amazing. No artificial lighting was used and it really brings out the details of the city. I loved the first person perspective towards the end when he is wearing the gas mask. The music is subtle and just enough to add to the scenes without being distracting. Is it just me, or does Natalie Portman's age seem to vary from [8](http://i.imgur.com/5oMRvu3.png) to [16](http://i.imgur.com/5vJ67Wk.png) in these photos?I fucking love this film!^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^."

I really wish it was on Netflix (Canada).  I should check my local library...Could not find Janet Reno no matter how many times I went through the photos.i have never seen the scene (saw the scene... scene the saw?) where Leon has the guy in the tattooed guys mouth. is that from the international version?Hey, that's not Janet Reno...oh, wait...nevermindAnyone else a little disappointed that the versions that were added to Prime and Netflix were the US versions and not the international version?Love Jean Reno, has he ever done an ama ?At the insistence of this particular post, I watched Leon: The Professional on Netflix.  I am 33, and I had never seen it, and for that, I am both saddened and happy.  I'm saddened that I've missed such an incredible character driven movie, and happy that I was able to REALLY enjoy it at a more mature age."
"This move was incredible.  Thanks, Reddit.This movie has the most profound effect on me. I first saw it when I was 12 and I fell in love with everything about it, including Natalie Portman. From the opening scene I was completely enthralled. The film made me want to be a filmmaker. I was fascinated and terrified by Gary Oldman's character. The first time I saw it I cried at the end and then watched it three more times in a row. I have probably seen this movie a hundred times. I know it's not the best movie in terms of all the criteria critics use but it is my favorite movie of all time. No movie (or book or any other form of art) elicits such a nostalgic fondness.  Whenever I see references to it I get an actual tightness in my chest and a slight ache, remembering how much the film affected me when I was little. I really really really love movies set in NYC in this time frame (80s and 90s). The city in itself had so much more character back then than I feel it does now, when it was dirty and grungy and not as safe. Can anyone recommend their favorite NYC late 80s early 90s dramas?God, I adore Jean Reno. He has serious acting chops - and he's handsome. Sadly, a lot of people I know only recognize him from the 1990's American Godzilla.20 candid photos on the set for Leon...? I DON'T HAVE TIIIIMEEE FOR THIS MICKEEY MOUSE BULLLLSHIT! Fucking crush I had on Natalie Portman (BTW I was 12 then !!)http://i.imgur.com/e4ckkzC.png"
"Why aren't they on the sidewalk?  How can they get away with walking down the middle of the street?Probably my all time favorite movie.I remember learning about Natalie when I was in gradeschool.  She did the diary of Anne Frank performance and she had pictures in our textbook.  She was always my crush.  Then she became an actor and I stayed a normal American.  Such is life.Bring me everyoneI ate dinner 3 feet from Jean Reno at the old homestead in nyc a few years ago. He's a cool regular guy.jean reno showed up one random night last. year at the bar i wotk at in Montreal..he got fucked up on grappa with his francophone friend. he told me he was in town for the weekend to party...he looks old and bloated lol. i told him the professional was one of my favorite movies of all time and shared a shot with himSuggestion: L'immortel (2010), very underrated movie staring Jean Reno.I've always liked those cloth neck band things that women wear. I don't know why they didn't become more popular than they are now. I think guys like them a lot, and they're way more modest and pretty than things like gold necklaces, which are gaudy and a bit bad looking. What are those cloth neck things called, chokers? They look awesome on women. Very exotic, yet feminine.[A full Youtube vid of the most excellent soundtrack by Eric Serra.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ8a4WKz3xY) Also contains songs from Bjork and other artists found in the film. I don't have TIME for this Mickey Mouse bull squash.The cinematography in this film is phenomenal.No women, no children.Makes SPEED seem like a slow ride to Grandma's house - actual box copy[deleted]I can see how that could've been awkward. Kind of like watching Eyes Wide Shut with your parents. serious mancrush Jean Reno. [We're all thinking it.](http://imgur.com/JdAPEiS)Just watched this for the first time last night. One thing that was funny to me was that the soundtrack is literally the Goldeneye soundtrack. Even the song right at the end is the [exact same one used at the end of Goldeneye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-BEBhtw27U). The guy recycled the same score, but I'm not complaning. Goldeneye is one of my favorite movies.This is my favoritest fucking movie. ever. what was luc besson's last decent movie?Wtf, I literally just watched this last night for the first time!She reminds me of ~~Emily~~ Elizabeth from Bioshock in some of these photos.Ha back when Besson was a good director and not a running joke here in France. Watch Nikita for those of you that have not yet, very good movie too. Holy shit,  that's Ser DavosAm I the only one that thought that the funniest Gary Oldman scene was when he is told to calm down before shooting near the old lady and he replies  I'm calm in a very confused voice?"
"EDIT: Actually no, I changed my mind after youtubing a few clips. The funniest scene is his reaction when he notices a hole in his suit jacket.I love this movie, but Besson is a hack. Judging by how much reddit likes this movie, I should probably make ends effort to see it.They should throw Jean Reno in the next ExpendablesIf you liked Leon, you'd like Wasabi (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0281364/).Well, now I have to watch it again."
"It's just such a cool movie. Well, that seems like a movie that should be on my to-watch-list Never realized that was Natalie PortmanOne of the greatest films of all time!Just watched it for the first time on Netflix. Absolutely loved itI just watched this movie for the first time last night. I loved it so much that I'm considering watching it again tonight. Absolutely amazing movie that I can't believe as a film buff I made it to 23 without seeing. Fuck that was an incredible movie. I should go watch it right nowI know it sounds weird but I forget this was a movie and not real life story sometimes So when can we expect Mathilda: The Professional?[deleted]This may be one of the best threads I've read in awhile.  Where else but here could the discussion include Leon and True Romance two of my favorite movies. I've always wondered why they never made a sequel to this with her as an adult. Loli Natalie Portman is the greatest Great movie! Gary Oldman is one of the, if not the best when playing a bad guy psychopath. Reno and Oldman's performance in this movie is nearly flawless. 9.9/10.0!!One of my favorite moviesThis is my favorites movie f all time.  Jean Reno Gary old man and Natalie all put on an incredible performance.  ButthatsnottheshapeofmyheartThis looked like a really fun experience.Just watched this for the first time yesterday. Loved it.Such an underrated and overlooked movie, i found about it by total accident. I would love to see another one. Prequel perhaps or another movie like it. Its really well done."
"Definitely recommend you watch the extended version of this movie.Everytime I watch this movie it gets betterThis movie is a real masterpiece.I knew Natalie Portman acted from a very young age, but I've never heard anyone call her a child actor. She would have been a great talking point in the countless highschool debates I had with friends for whether child acting was just a gateway to a shitty adulthood. I haven't got time for this Mickey Mouse bullshit! I wished I watched this movie soon. Really good casting.Alt J wrote a song about this movie and it's fucking awesome. I'd link it but I'm on mobile One of my favorite movies that I constantly forget about how much I love it."
"Then someone mentions it and I want to go watch it again.IT'S ON NETFLIX EVERYONE!!!Maybe it is just me, but I've always thought that Oldman in Leon and Charlie from Always Sunny are characters on the same personality spectrum.Just rewatched this movie because of the thread. Great performances. Couldn't believe that was Gary Oldman, then I realized it was filmed over 20 years ago. Mr.French is the manThis movie always got me in the feels.I still think they missed a huge opportunity by not having Natalie Portman make a cameo in an after-credits scene for John Wick.He really looks like Chris Pratt in that first picture. I LOVE this movie!Time to watch the movie again for the 5th time. She's butterflying her thumbs in #18. I expected better from an assassin.She's so young!The uncut version of this is my favorite movie.I like seeing photos of the baddies being goofy off set. Reminds me they're humanJust watched this last night, finally made it to netflix!This is awesome, but I wasn't aware that anyone called it Leon: The Professional. Don't people just call it The Professional?The Professional is the US cut, Leon is the international cut. I combined the two to bring in both audiences. It might be called L:TP nowadays thoughI could never figure out Danny Aiello was ripping Leon off. Was he a good guy or a jerk? I've seen both versions a few times even.It's heavily implied that he was skimming money off of Leon.Damnit, Now I want to watch it again...Surprised there has been no shout out to Walken/Hopper's performance from T.R. Can't mention the film without it. You're a cantaloupe. Fantastic film and particularly one of my favorite scenes ever... film too, I suppose. oh you have netflix too?!*Mathilda: The Professional*"
"This needs to happen.What I've read is that Besson's company is all butthurt that he left, and they're holding the rights hostage or something. So don't hold your breath.ITT: links to the gif of Gary OldmanSuch a good movieI remember watching this movie on Wowow (a Japanese channel on Philippine cable TV) when I was in highschool (so pre-internet days in Philippines). I had a huge crush on that girl without knowing it was her. Fast forward a couple of years, I realized it was Natalie Portman. I was a little blown away."
"Similar feeling I had with Empire of the Sun. The time I realized it was Christian Bale.Absolutely amazing movie, one of my all-time favorites. So many things to love but mainly the acting is just phenomenal from all involved."
"Of course, it didn't hurt that I was 14 when I first saw this movie back in 1995 and pretty much immediately developed a huge crush on Natalie Portman. Goddamn, look at the tits on Luc in the pic with Natalie!Thiiiiiiis...............................iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiissssssss...........foooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooor.......................................................................maaaaaaaaaaaatiiillllllllllllldaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaI've never seen that movie, but I think I'm going to watch it now Jean Reno is such a badass!What a great movie. See it if you haven't. I feel as though Gary Oldman is the original dicaprio. (as in he's never won an Oscar and he's giving us so many great roles) Double finger on the trigger is dat shit!This is wear my crush of Natalie Portman stems from.natalie has always and will always be a bad ass bitch.I havnt actually watched that movie"
"is it any good ?Every time I watch this when Gene Kelly comes on I end up watching singing in the rain...Oh my, I love this film so much!..this....is.....from...........Ma....tilda......."
"shit"
"What happened to you Luc Besson? Lucy was total shitSo did I guess everyone else saw the recently added list on netflix too...Also I'd love to see another movie along these lines, Matilda the Professional.  Something along the lines of Matilda now being a cleaner, and perhaps she saves a little boy? I'd watch that on principle alone. Wow I just watched this movie last night after not seeing it for years. Now it's on reddit Gary Oldman is arguably the most talented living actor.Like every other living actor.God I love EEEEVREYONEEE of these photos!My family had an illegal cable hookup in our place back in the mid 90's,  this was one of the first movies I remember watching on stolen Pay per view.Wow, i started watching this before i saw this posthttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=R1w_wcc_27M"
"I loved the score in the film.  The end scene was so sad and the music really suited it.  My sister named her child after this film.I'll be watching this tonightI'm going to keep my thoughts about Natalie Portman in this film to myself.  This is from Matilda Leon the Professional is so good because it relies on the chemistry and acting of the characters.  Jean Reno, Natalie Portman, and Gary Oldman made the movie.  Wow those are powerful. Natalie was a seriously cutely powerful kid.Gary oldman was a boss in this film. And the amount of talent Natalie had for a 13 year old still blows my mind. Incredible filmLuc, I love your movies, but you are one creepy dude.going to have to watch again.I thought this film was a masterpiece on release and my opinion has not changed since.I must have the leather in photo 3.Watched this film for the first time when I was about 15 years old and it's been my favourite film ever since. Nothing else comes close (except Withnail & I, but that's a story for another day).I watched this for the first time like 3 days ago. Jean Reno is the coolest.Bring me everyone.  ^everyoneNatalie. You are a badass chickLeon was my favourite film of all time, after that, i tracked down all of Jean Reno's films. Was not a good idea. Wasabi should never be seen by anyone, ever... Welp, that just ruined Natalie Portman for me. Thanks Internet.Great movie.  Loved it. In my all time top 5.1st Thought: Aww yisssss...Natalie Portman is hot!"
"2nd Thought: Aww nahhhh...she was, like...13. Starting right now on BBC America. Funny thing, this is on BBC America right now.Loved this movie.ditto!!I definitely would not have the strength to yell young Natalie portman noThis...is for...Matilda....[deleted]Great movie. Think i've seen it 5 or 6 times already.Just watched the whole movie on Netflix thinking thsts what brought up this post. Only to get let down and not see the international cut."
"Anybody know where I can find it?"
"I truly loved this film. One of my favoritesFlat out a very good movie I wish they could have made a detective thriller with Mickey Rourke vs. Gary Oldman, both playing with the intensity they used, respectively, in Angel Heart and Leon.Playing on BBC America right now. Watched this last night. It got a little weird when the girl jumped out in a bra and started singing and dancing like Madonna. Different times I guess...I'm finally going to watch this in English.One of my favorite movies of all time. Gary Oldman is so creepy and villainous. Maybe the best performance of his career.I loved this movie so much, the performance of the actors, Jean and Gary were awesome, and Natalie struck me as the best child actor i've seen. The plot was very good and the character development just magnificient. I loved the relationship between Leon and MathildaIt's so funny I watched this last nightFilm > digital"
"These stills ooze character and atmosphere Jean Reno bleeds coolThis is from...this is from...This is from Mathilda.One of my favorite movies ever.This is probably one of my favourite films of all time. Thanks for posting these.  One of my top 10 filmsEEEVREEEYOOOONNNEEEEE!I've been meaning to watch this recently I HAVEN'T GOT TIME, FOR THIS MICKEY MOUSE BULLSHIT!It's on Netflix right now!By the way, it's on Netflix. Awesome photos. Definitely one of my favorite movies ever.Quite possibly my favorite movie. 'No women no children'I knew this crazy bitch who enjoyed roll playing as Matilda and Stan. After seeing this for the first time in a long time, I miss her. Love this movie. The whole story is awesome. I never saw Leon, the unedited version. I always looked up to Leon as a protector! I wanna see the real thing now. Sounds like a chunk of story I'm missing. I should probably watch this movie.We need a SEQUEL! Mathilda:Semi Professional starring Princess Amidala!I hate to be the one to bring it up, but I've always felt that Portman has taken roles well below her potential. I feel she could do so much better than Amidala. I would love to see a sequel with her."
"So good. Pic 12 looks like it could be from a great Wes Anderson film.Just passing by and leaving a comment. Chill out!This was one of the first films I got for my collection I don't know how many years ago. It's a work of art. Every piece fits perfectly and creates a tale I can watch again and again. On top of that, it's so damn quotable."
"It's the guy. He's here. He's got a gun to my head. So glad I saw this. This movie was so epic! I know she didn't want to be typecast, but I wish she had taken the role of Lolita.I'm impressed Janet Reno had time to star in a movie while running the Justice Department. I watched it and I didn't understand what was so good about it... Can someone explain what they liked and why they think it's good? I feel like I might not be fully grasping it or something.Just saw this movie on BBC America this evening! I think this qualifies for /r/oldschoolcoolJust realised that Alt-Js songs Leon and Matilda are about this movie, bit off topic but I am seeing them in Brisbane tomorrow WOOOOOOOOOOOOOII really want to see Gary Oldman and Natalie Portman reenact that first picture.The US The Professional edit was terrible. I'll assume nobody else in this thread will admit it.Which edit do you recommend?Or perhaps you're the only person who thinks that.i think this might be the case.  US edit?  BLASPHEMY! I just watched this movie last night!  I loved this movie as a kid. I'm going to watch it after the clippers game.Still waiting for a sequel :PWas looking for this movie after watching the movies sing wutang clan ain't nothing to fuck with. https://youtube.com/watch?v=H-8N3BEoyHkSaw it last night for the first time ever. This feels a little Baader-Meinhof.I'd love to see a sequel where Matilda is all grown up and is now a CleanerThat time when I actually liked Natalie and felt she wasn't stereotypical.Have to watch the movie again.we need an ama about this guy he is legit badasssWatching for the first time today load up reddit and see this post OP do you work for the N.S.A http://i.imgur.com/0VB2jur.jpgNot enough Gary OldmanThe greenish photo with the florescent lights and the gun play is the best one.My favorite movie of the 90's. Me and my friends would quote this movie non-stop for days. This is.. for Matilda'. Oh myh, good times.What an amazing blast from the past. Once I looked at these I had to watch the movie in full again. Thanks for the memory.There's a scene in the kitchen in the movie where you can see the mic on Natalie's shirt :-)I don't remember seeing this scene with classic Hispanic tatoo guy.Most likely you saw the US theatrical version, which Besson considered the director's cut. It was shown in other countries, but mostly in the US."
"That scene was likely in the International Version, which Besson calls 'the long version', with an additional 25 minutes of footage. Most of it was cut from the second act, a lot of Leon and Mathilda's training and her going with him on several missions.Hey, thanks, I obviously never heard of this long version. I might look for it.Quite welcome."
"The 'International Version' is 2h13, there's also an 'Uncut Edition' that's 2h16 (I think it's the blu-ray? dunno). I'm not sure what the difference is between them, though.VAnyone know where I can get that L E O N shirt?    Absolutely love this movie, pure nostalgia for meThis is one of the best set of photos I've ever seen.GoodSaw that movie when I was around 13 and had the biggest crush on that girl. TIL that was Natalie Portman, who I've had the biggest crush on as long as I can remember."
"It all makes sense.If I was Leon I would've smashed that shit when she was asking for it.  That part made me so mad.  http://i.imgur.com/GyAxUcR.jpgMy understanding is that Pedobear is supposed to be pedophile, not a hebophile. The correct meme here, then, is [this one](http://static1.fjcdn.com/comments/DO+NOT+WANT+_4c916fcb7402478f9a4073a936fd164c.jpg)."
"Ah, thanks, I get them confused.Leon is probably my favorite film.   Theres not a bad scene in it,  the casting is amazing,  every character that has a line has such a great personality.  I even love the major when he gets shot with the paint ball.  You can totally tell what that mayor is like from his one or two lines."
"My only regret is accidentally watching the extended edition.  Wow that was awful!  Totally changes the feeling of the film and Natalie Portmans character is no longer an innocent girl with all the hit scenes.  The film almost becomes a black comedy."
"I stand by my stance that you should never watch an extended version of a film as I've never seen one that improves a film. I watched it again on Netflix the other day for the first time since the 90s and the two things that struck me differently were 1. Gary Oldman's performance was much much better than I remember and 2. Natalie Portman's performance was much worse than I remember. Some of her lines just seemed so unbelievableI was going to watch Game of Thrones tonight *buttfuckit* I'm throwing this on instead. Been at least 19 years since I've seen it.Watched it again recently myself for the first time in years.... Still fantastic! I always felt this film had a fundamental story flaw. Mathilda should've been the one to kill Stansfield. The entire film was building up to it. Leon had been training her to be a cleaner, after all. The scene at the end where Leon is walking through the hallway, seeing the light of freedom ahead, but then Stansfield appears behind him and draws his gun...the BAM of the gun (which you assume is Stansfield) should've been revealed to be Mathilda standing behind him, thus avenging the murder of her family. Despite loving the film, I always felt a little cheated by that.I really hate the American version of the film. When I saw it in Netflix a part of me was excited until I realized it would be the same edited crap I rented after seeing the full version. It's the perfect example of an amazing movie ruined.Reno, Portman, Oldman, they were all on fire for this movie."
"It's a little bit arty, a little bit gangster, a little bit dangerous, but one huge dollop of style wrapped about some serious substance. If I have such a thing as a top ten, this is there.Thanks for making me a pedophile OP.Idk y but I really loved this movie.  When I first saw it and the movie ended I just hit replay and watched it again. Then the next day I rewarched it and again the next 3 or 4 days. Forgot how long ago I first saw it was. Maybe 3 years agoMachilda. This movie is in my top 10. Leon version not the Professional. Just fantastic What's the difference?Too lazy to type on my phone. Basically more movie. http://forums.anandtech.com/showthread.php?t=33824I love this movie. It came out when I was 9 and the idea of a child assassin just seemed so awesome to me back then. Crap, it kind of still does."
"Now I wanna watch this and Gunslinger Girl :)"
"If you see this movie and like it you should see the international version as well. It has a couple of other scenes, one of which is the Ring Trick scene that I always find funny. I believe the image where they are holding guns in the green hallway is from that, but it's been quite a while so I'm not positive."
"Either way it's a good movie if you like dirty cops and revenge. Gary Oldman is a fantastic villain as usual.   So I know they are not related in any way except for the similar characters played by Jean Reno, but in my mind I have always imagined that Leon is in fact Victor from La Femme Nikita who has changed his name and moved to the US to get a fresh start in his later years. Maybe it's just me though.....It is definitely not just you. I've done the same, and thought that's what it was going to be after seeing previews. Besson's words were that Reno was kind of playing victors American cousin. Same idea but a little more human. How old was Mathilda actually supposed to be in that movie? She obviously lies about her age but I don't recall her true age being made obvious.She was supposed to be 12, it is mentioned a couple of times in the movie I'm just here to say that I fucking love this movie. I saw it in the late 90s when I was a kid and I swear it had some kind of effect on me. I never became a hitman or anything but that's not really the whole point of the movie now is it?It is one of the greats, a must watch for anyone, and awesome photos, I might have to watch this tonight. definitely in my top 5 movies ever EVERYONE is in this pics...Gary Youngman.I liked so much about this movie, but in the original scipt (and in typical French fashion) the love affair between Leon and Mathilda was made more explicit, but in the end it was cut out in the  because they thought it was too risque. It's a shame, because you really need those moments to make the ending work, in my opinion. There is also a nice little contrast between Mathilda, who is young but is much more worldly that her age suggests and Leon, who is older but is not wise to the ways of the world.Who would have guessed. She was full grown when she made that movie.back when luc besson was luc besson and not complete shitWow...didn't realize that was Luc Besson."
"Just saw Lucy recently. Didn't really like it....Saw who the directed was: Luc Besson...was wondering what else he did."
"Fifth element? Angel-A? La Femme Nikita?The fifth Element Natalie Portman was so cute in this movieI also have not seen this film. I know what I'm doing this afternoon. Cheers to paid work vacation!What are the wildest odds that I just started watching this movie an hour ago. But I got bored 30 mins in so I stopped it. Natalie portman has a literally .... PERFECT FACE.I noticed that too.  I do orthodontic research, and there are actually objective criteria for facial perfection.  She pretty much nails every one of them, except her nose is a touch too wide."
"Another actress that matches all the criteria is (was) Audrey Hepburn.Everyone?"
"EVERYYYYYONEEEEEEEE!Going back to my childhood, it was *this* movie that developed my love for cinema. Up until this point, I probably only cared for movies that featured dinosaurs or sharks. This movie really helped me develop a taste for narrative and direction, and grown-up movies as a whole. I started paying attention to directors, writers, and cinematographers, and following their careers. I used to write down my favorites. This was before IMDb, so if you wanted a compiled list of movie credits, you had to make your own. The thing I like the most about this movie is it's atmosphere. The vibrant color, the ambient lighting... re-watching it always triggers the nostalgia of what it felt like when I was a kid watching this movie. I always regarded this movie as a fringe, out-side the mainstream of movies, since no one my age had seen it, or even given it a second thought. It gave me great joy one day when I noticed it was in imdb.com's top 30! I wish I could personally thank Luc Besson for making this movie and putting me down a path of a cinematic odyssey.  Awww.. This is when I fell for Natalie Portman (I was 12 at the time)Why are like... all the best movies from '94?Natalie's frame as a kid looked like she would grow into a tall woman...Wow, was watching this last night on Netflix. It's been over 20 years since I last saw it. Thanks Reddit.for the first time, an actual movie that's better quality than it's still photos.Seriously want a sequel just for the fuck of it. I was five when I watched this and remember natalie portman being one of my earliest crushes.Technically, Colombiana was one, and about as good as it will get."
"Natalie Portman never wanted to do one. I think she thought she was too good for it. Idiot.Oh, but she's not too good to play that cheeseball Amidala crap?I think she's a crazy bitch, honestly.creepy film So my husband was all estatic when he found out Leon: The Professional was on Netflix and I never saw the movie.  He made me watch it and I said when was this made? 1995? He said I was really close and how I figured it out.  Natalie was wearing a chocker. Definitely a fad back in the mid-90's.I never understood why everyone thinks this movie is so great.Cause of the story.Ha! Great answer! :)Jesus Christ you pedos!"
"I'll say it. I didn't much care for this film. I didn't get sucked in to it, or really even enjoy most of it. I find the premise too preposterous to get beyond that.This is one of my favorite movies. I was about Natalie Portman's age when it came out, and I had developed a huge crush on her. Natalie was such a lolita back then, so fucking cute.The downvotes are real. I wonder whats wrong with my comment, as the movie even had problems because Natalie was so young and had some sexual related scenes.> I wonder whats wrong with my comment"
"If I have to guess, you're getting downvoted because you're sexualizing a 12 year-old child.Yeah I am, not the movie. K.There was some discussion in the thread about whether or not Luc Besson meant to sexualize Portman for his own pleasure, or if it's just an aspect of the story. Let's say he did it because he's into teenaged girls. But guess what? Watching this movie didn't make you a pedophile."
"I'm not going to shame you for desiring children. That's your business.  Just do yourself and the rest of us a favor and don't vocalize your penis' opinion of the 12-year old next time.So from my comment you take I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO TAP PORTMAN'S 12 YEAR OLD ASS ?"
"You sir really need some lessons in interpretation. Shame on YOU for being a failed product of your country's educational system.I'm curious, what did you mean by your comment then?Instead of replying to such a stupid question, has your mother never asked you Do I look good in these? or Do I look cute in these? ? Did you sexualize when answering?It's really creepy seeing Luc Besson hugging on young Natalie Portman; what with those dopey eyes, his propensity for having sex with young girls, and the pedophilia that was in the original screenplay of Leon.I agree.  This movie was disturbingly pedo and made me kind of sick.  Here we all are, down here at the bottom.  You're supposed to like Leon. Why do I have the sneaking suspicion that, generally, public opinion about this film will change, and drastically?Fucking reddit and it's hard-on for little girlsGreat movie,  but Natalie Portman is highly over rated. Are you stating that about this movie or just in general? If you've seen this movie, recall the scene when she walks by her apartment to Leon's. You've got to appreciate her in that scene.The movie was good.  Great acting all around.  I think Portman has become over-rated as she's matured. Not saying she isn't good,  just saying she isn't great. Genuinely curious, why is the circlejerk overt this movie so strong? I enjoyed it but this sub makes it seem like a top 5 movie.  Can someone enlighten to a moderately casual movie enjoyer? Or link to a good analysis or something?  Is there cinematography that I'm just not seeing or...? I just really don't get it. I don't know, I think there's some kind of crossover in the Leon/Pedophile/Anime/Reddit continuum."
"I've actually read the original script. I know what they were going for. It's not fun.There are definitely hints of Leon being a lil pedo-y.  So that's no surprise.  Do you have a link to the original or is it easily findable?I had a hard copy, I think it's the shooting script. It's probably around here somewhere.  I am willing to bet it's easy to find on the internet. The worst parts of the script that had to be cut are pretty well known in the film industry, so I'm sure that part is on the internet.  It's kind of a lesson in how to be/not be really creepy. The director wanted to toe that line, and a lot of people thought the theatrical version achieved this (though everyone agrees the original script was over the top, especially when Natalie Portman tells Jean Reno to fuck her and he does it--that part may even have been shot, I don't know). I find the film pretty distasteful even in its theatrical release.That part I didn't know. That would've been ridiculous. Gives a new undertone for those scenes for me now. Thanks For the infoI'd park my boat in Natalie's port, man.EVERYONE!!!!!!!!!!!Fun Fact: When it came out, it was just called The Professional. It wasn't until it came out on DVD years later that they renamed it Leon: The Professional.That's the difference between American and European releasesThat's why I always called it The Professional and not Leon..... I thought I was just lazy this whole time and the name just stuck for that reason. WowAm I the only one who had no idea that was Natalie Portman? I loved that movie LOL1994 was more than 20 years ago. Fuck.Oh, how I loathe this film.Natalie portman so fuckable!i feel so dirty after watching that movie.  y'all know what i'm talking about.Your getting down voted to hell but most guys will agreewell it's on purpose, and the tension it creates is one of the reasons it's such a good movie.  but if they want to pretend its not there, whatever.Holy shit! I just saw this with my daughter last night! We loved itHere come the pedo argumentsNever understood why Reddit loves this cheesy movie...maybe because you are a tool with taste akin to a cockroach? idk you decideOh man I haven't watched that movie in 15 years. I remember liking it... Might have to queue it up on Amazon Prime tonight.Talk about Synchronicity, I just watched this for the first time yesterday and this shows up on the front page. Great movie though. One of my fav chidlhood movies. Yep, an R rated flick is a childhood movie to me. Such a good movie! That is all.Just saw this on Netflix for the first time last night.  Fucking fantastic.  Gary Oldman was terrifyingly good, and it was nice to see Natalie Portman play a character with some cojones.  Might watch it again tonight.I regularly drink milk because of this movieMy favorite movie of all time. Could watch it every month... Wait, that's what I'm doing. Someone should recut Leon: The Professional as a family comedy movie trailer, called Gary and Me, and incorporate the first photo somehow. http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/35100000/Norman-leon-35112912-245-150.gif"
"One of my favorite movies of all timeDefinitely my fav movie for all 3 main actors. Natalie Portman, Gary oldman, Jean Reno. I'm 25 now, have been watching it since I was 15, still one of my fav movies. Can't really appreciate Gary Oldman until you've seen this movieI need to rewatch this.One of my favorite movies of all time!!im singing in the rain... just singing in the rain...Man I love this movie so muchI have always loved this movie."
"It was really great when I find out Natalie Portman was my age almost to the day. :-)"
"Re-watching this tonight! Thanks for reminding me of this amazing movie.I still think Natalie Portman should make the sequel.This is why reddit is a daily stop for me. Thank you OP.Portman, Oldman, and Reno are exceedingly well casted for their roles in this movie, and, it's a Besson too.  What could be better!She really needs to do a squeal! Seeing what's become of her after all these years. I saw this for the first time last weekend on BBC America after smoking, one of the most awesome movies ive seen in a while.This is my favorite movie.  Watching it gave me so many feels.Number 1 movie on my list.Thank you for posting this. Leon will always be my #1 favorite movie of all time!I now own 8 plants because of this wonderful film. I was expecting John Wick to be like this movie. Oh how foolish I was...my favourite movie of all time.This is my favorite movie, thank you for this. :)They need to combine the sequel for this with John Wick 2. Natalie Portman as a grown assassin, and it's the same world!"
"Make it so.Fantastic movie Wow, surprising that My brother was watching this movie yesterday as I got  home from work. I stayed and watched. Such a good movie.I think it's a really a beautiful movie.  It gets a  lot of credit for the action, which it deserves, but it's so much more than that.This is definitely my favorite movie.No Women No KidsI only watched this because my dad told me to, and every movie my father has recommended to me has been fantastic and watching more than once. This did not fail either.EVERYONE!I liked this movie until that deleted scene...I wonder how many people had to tell Luc Besson he couldn't marry Natalie before he believed them. That [ninth photo down](http://i.imgur.com/H20xeAH.jpg), I don't remember that scene. Is that in the movie/deleted scene/am I just not remembering it?Yeah it's from Leon: The Professional, the director's cut.My favorite movie of all times. Watched it probably 50 times.Natalie Portman is definitely old enough to be a professional now.As a kid, I had the biggest hard on for Natalie Portman because of this movie One of the best movies of all time. One of my favorites too. Luc Besson - simply an amazing director. Sure his work is borderline cheesy these days but he makes it work."
"First film I saw was Leon and then the Taxi series which I actually watched in France without knowing a stitch of French. Watching it with subtitles afterwards was so much better. [deleted]I guess you weren't around in the '90sBack when Natalie Portman gave a shit about acting..."
"Marvel has basically canned her because she is utterly boring and does nothing but coast off her performance in Leon. It's a shame.This is my favorite movie. This makes me happy!A fantastic movie is so many ways.  One of my personal favorites.  You must see the director's cut.It just got added to netflixWow, wonderful timing with the post. I just watched the film last night. Really enjoyed it :)just watched this for the first time the other day, definitely confirmed the pure brilliance of Gary Oldman"
"https://bashboompow.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/leon.jpgIf every single on of them (Reno, Oldman, Portman) got an Oscar for their performances nobody would say antything. The movie could also got an award for best motion picture, best soundtrack and few more."
"Instead... it was not nominated at all. How did that happen I'll never know.If you're interested in the behind the scenes I can highly recommend the book L'Histoire De Leon, though it might be hard to find 20 years later."
"[I took some pictures of my copy to give an idea of how filled with information it is.](http://imgur.com/a/OwXck)"
"I think it's only available in French. It's not my primary language but I bought it anyway. I understand it well enough to get the gist of it, plus there are lots of pictures :-)This is such a well rounded film! If you ain't seen it....SEE IT!"
"I miss Besson back when he knew to make a great movie and not just money.Those frosted tips on Besson...Great film. One of the worst directors cuts ever. Also the US had an edited theatrical release. Standard euro version is the best by a mile. Just watched it last night... sheesh that was hard to watch... Gary Oldman's character is pure evilI've got great memories of this film. It was one of the first films I was introduced to by my mum as a kid. It happens to be one of my very favourite films of all time. Also it has one of the best first time acting roles of all time by Natalie Portman and one of the best portrayal of a villain I've ever seen by Gary Oldman. Really is a classic film. Edit: words. I don't have time for this Mickey Mouse bullshit!What a great movie.I just watched this movie for the first time last night and i got to say it was a really good movie.This movie plagiarized Gloria.Crazy coincidence, I just re-watched this on Netflix last night while simultaneously learning Hall and Oates songs on my guitar.  I hadn't seen it since my dad rented it back in the 90's... it's a sign.. the planets are lining up... [It's happening!!!](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/2013/05/Ron-Paul_Its-Happening1.gif)"
"What's happening?  Not sure yet."
"When did they add the Leon part? To me I always knew it by the professional?Only called The Professional in the US, called Leon everywhere else, they changed the name for US release for the same reason US gets alternative movie posters and video game box art...I really liked Leon but barely remember Oldman's performance.i must be the only person who was not impressed by this movie with the exception of gary oldman.Pedophiles LOVE IT!Hebephiles, technically."
"sequel plzSomehow misread that as Janet Reno. Little disappointed.Wow I iust saw this film yesterday. Upvote!I just wish so badly this movie was on Netflix.  It's been so long since I've seen it, but I remember it being great.ummm..type in Leon on your Netflix search.Don't know if you're being serious or trolling, because it is on Netflix (US). I watched it last night, amazing film!.That is a good point you have there. I never considered the matter that way before.And you just brightened up my day.   Thank you.   I was just saving the spot because this was one of my favorite movies and you just went and made things better.One of my fav flicks for the last 21 years now. How did you find this?? I wish they would have put this on my old DVD and then the Blu-ray. Thank You!This available too watch anywhere online ? Netflix.This movie is my favorite and also Man on Fire with WashingtonI was watching this last night and man this movie didn't age well.[removed]~~Relevant name~~ Holy cow NO!"
"Wtf dude?What?[removed]Maybe i_rape_sluts is 13, too.tth_tth"
"EDIT: Dude above me said: back when she was hot!What?I wonder what Reno did... [oooooh my GAAAAWWWWD!](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-04-08/film-star-jean-reno-returns-as-doraemon-in-new-live-action-ad)http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0122690/?ref_=nm_knf_i2"

"17 of the funniest movie lines censored for TVSome of these are so bizarre that it makes you more aware it's been edited!"
"When you find a stranger in the Alps?!"
"My eye are wide focussed openAh, I remember my last vacation in Austria."
"You won't believe what happened: I was about to go skiing when I saw that guy in front of me. I didn't know him. Of course things escalated (he was a stranger after all) and that guy plucked me up for no reason."
"I tell you man, monkey-fighting strangers.Sloppy.That 'This whole town's a chicken, just waiting to get plucked' still makes sense in the context, actually.The DVD they released after the first digital remaster has a whole segment specifically for the TV edit.  That shit is legendary.Especially since the town went from being a pussy to being a cock.The Big Lebowski one was most certainly purposely ridiculous. That has the Coens written all over it. In [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Im-Lebowski-Youre-Life-What/dp/1596912464), John Goodman says something about how he asked the Coen brothers what they wanted to say and they said they didn't care, so the actors intentionally came up with the most ridiculous shit they could think of. As far as I recall the Coens weren't even involved with the redub outside of that brief conversation."
"If I'm remembering right, all of that was actually ad-libbed entirely by Goodman, which is awesome.It sounds like John Goodman did the actual dialogue too, and it seems sort of fitting for his bizarre character anyways. Everything's a fuckin' travesty with you, man! And what was all that shit about the Alps? What the FUCK has anything got to do with strangers in the Alps?Totally. And it's so much funnier when you get the entire scene. Find a stranger in the alps isn't the only thing Goodman says:"
"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCcKBcZzGdADoes he say ...what happens when you feed a stranger scrambled eggs? at about 0:42?You see what happens when you feed a stoner scrambled eggs!"
"Did I hear that right? That is an awesome line.Well, I didn't want to spoil it in the comments... but yes, that's what I heard too.They censored all that, but it sounds like the guy at the end still says I kill your fucking car!I think he said I'll kill your ugly car man!No, right after that."
"It sounds like he says I'll kill your ugly car, man. I'll kill your fucking car."
"Maybe they didn't censor it since the music and glass breaking noises were covering it.Wow, that Departed line was dreadful. Clearly just edited in from another line.They even use the exact same sample both times.  Fuuuck.When you watch[ the full scene ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hm6BZXSQZk#t=34)you can tell they didn't put any effort into trying to make it sound like the originalI believe that was the point."
"Same with The Big Lebowski See what happens when you find a stranger in the Alps - I laughed out loud on that one. It was probably sloppy on purpose.  I heard Edgar Wright say (I think on *Doug Loves Movies*) that they're contractually obligated to redub those things to meet TV and airline standards, but that they have broad leeway to replace words how they prefer.  In the case of Wright's *Scott Pilgrim vs. The World*, they replaced every instance of the word ass with owls just to take the piss."
"I'm guessing Martin Scorsese and/or Mark Wahlberg deliberately did it shitty as criticism of the practice.The Hot Fuzz DVD extras also showcased Wright's attitude towards TV redubs http://youtu.be/9k18Q_63KpE"

It would say crow's nest instead...My ROFLcoptor goes soi soi soi soi soi soi[deleted]I honestly thought that line couldn't be any better for TV broadcast. It really brings the movie together.I like to think he came up with the redub line himself, too.He said that he did on the graham norton show yesterday.He also said on the Tonight Show a while back that it's his favorite tv redub he's recorded.

I've never seen it on TBS, but I have seen it a ton of times on TNT. For that movie specifically, there is a big disclaimer stating it has strong violence and language and such. It's been very minimally censored I think because it's supposed to be a historic look at things and they don't want to hide the shit people went through during that time.Same reason they can show porn on public access.I think CSPAN regularly airs porn.

Digitally adding a bra like that is harder than it looks...Yeah, the effort they put into that is ridiculous considering how stupid it looks. my favorite Casino edit was for the line we may just have to kick a kike's ass outta town. it was changed it to we may just have to kick a kike's butt outta town. amazing. Mine's when they're in the desert and Joe Pesci calls De Niro a Jew motherfucker and they change it to Jew money-lover.

I've never seen the movie. Is there even a Mr. Falcon character? Dude go watch it, it's awesome Nope, that is what makes it totally ridiculous! [deleted]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ado-MY8zUzcWait, where's does he say that? I can't hear it?!Even for a white melon farmer like you, that's low"
"Jackson says it at the endDamn I'm stupid, I thought he was going to say yippee kay ay Melon farmer."
"Don't worry, me too....In Ireland I remember it being edited for TV as yippee ki-yay kemo sabe in a thick, slightly effeminate Belfast-accent.Funny thing is kemo sabe fits so much better than anything else they could use as a replacement.My favorite line is from Casino."
"The original line is Joe Pesci's character calling Robert De Niro's character a motherfucking Jew"
"On the TV version they changed it to Money loving Jew"
"I was like...That is worse.No, no, you don't understand. Antisemitic stereotypes are fine, it's the *fucking* that's a problem in America.Can't let the children hear swear words but antisemitism is totally fine.Honestly that first Scarface one is pretty well done.Censoring scarface for TV probably took more time and money than making the movie in the first place."
"I bet it had a 12 minute run time after too.[The word 'fuck' alone is said 195 times.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0B_5m3J9AoQ)"
"Then you factor in other cuss words and I'm curious to see how they edited the whole thing together. Did they dub every line? Did they straight up cut scenes?I never forget watching *Back to the Future* edited for TV. The line where Biff says, I'm gonna get that son of a bitch, is changed to I'm gonna get that [silence] bitch."
"I never understood that.I remember him saying son of a butthead. I've been regularly using that one ever since.being a son of a bitch is worse than being a bitch, duhI always liked the BTTF edits where son of a bitch is frequently replaced with, Snot nosed brat."
"Good times.Tropic Thunder's Never go full retard is Never go full special.Never go full handi-capable, manThat was the best line in the movie, i have no words for how stupid that change is.Yeah really. Pretty sure the people that get offended over the word retarded wouldn't be watching Tropic Thunder anyway.[Pineapple Express.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcIFMbyyEHU)that movie is mukkalukking terrible on cable. I actually thinks it's hilarious! I always laugh when Craig Robinson says mucka lucka. [Very relevant Stealing Harvard clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeX74VwRoGs&feature=player_detailpage#t=51)"
"If you just expand it rather than watch it on youtube, the relevant part is at 50 seconds.I was hungry so I thought I'd heat up a brick of cheese."
"I love that movie.It seems like they intentionally did some funny edits for that movie. Doesn't one of them call the other a melon farmer, also?Danny McBride says it but that's intentional, it's a parody of how some tv stations edit mother fucker with melon farmer.They messed with the wrong melon farmers!hott fuzzz did a [hilarious one as well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k18Q_63KpE)they also did one for shaun of the dead using the same word"
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY7D6rKjoKMThe swear box gag just doesn't work anymoreWell I'll assume you mean the whole scene, but just in case, there's a specific other gag in that in the original film the box has the swear words censored excluding 'Cunt'. Peas and rice!you silly ^barstoolYou cheeky funkster!And this is why i can't flunking watch movies on TV. It's bull spit.[This wasn't spoken, but I literally spat out my food when this popped up on the screen when I first saw it on TV. To this day I haven't laughed as hard at a censorship as I did this one. The acts that follow completely make no sense, as the original sign said I hate Niggers.](http://i.imgur.com/8W2qck9.png)"
"[Original scene for reference.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwpfSkB8nls)They also shooped a shirt on him.So a bunch of black guys just start beating someone up for being antisocial. It's hilarious how the edited version is more racist than the original.Censorship is rarely logical. It's about catering to peoples special snowflake feelings, not about making sense.They had Pulp Fiction in there and didn't include [Dead ^^African ^^American Storage?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdy0HeZtlqw&feature=kp)Oh gosh. This didn't actually air, did it?That ain't your rooty too-tootin' business.If you can ever watch the edited version of *The Rock*, do so, it is hilarious."
"Losers always whine about doing their best, winners goes home and *date* the prom queen.One of the reasons that I love that movie is that Nicholas Cage, who curses in every movie he does, doesn't curse. Sean Connery, who doesn't curse in his films, curses up a storm. I'm pretty sure they actually had Samuel L. Jackson do another take just for that line to look fluid. Sometimes they have the original actors provide the alternate dialog during [ADR sessions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubbing_(filmmaking\)).Yeah, but he's saying they actually did an actual take while filming so that his lips don't look like he's saying a different word than the ADR.[Still the best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6qrj_lIFbQ), even better than The Breakfast Club (which was a whole lot of FLIP YOU!)"
"Even though the guy who put it together left out the best part. Kneed him in the nuts and called him faggot in front of his family turned into kicked his guts and called him braggart in front of his parentsThey couldn't say studs?In the UK around 1992/3 I remember they put Robocop on the telly for the first time. Trouble is by that point loads of kids loved Robocop, and the UK had a hard on for censorship until about 1997."
"Anyway they transmit this kid-friendly version of Robocop, at 9pm I think (so still past watershed by UK standards), and every single swear-word is replaced. Every fucking is freakin' etc...The dude that says ahh, fuck you! to Robo in the drug factory scene says something like Ahh forget you! and it just went on and on. Every bullet hit that could have been edited out was trimmed significantly."
"It was a beautiful example of censorship gone mad, it caused a bit of a debate at the time, but it was on ITV so essentially there was a trend of doing this sort of thing."
"Edit yay some youtube examples: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pjThvRQ0gsOnce I even called him... airhead.I watched Kill Bill on TV once and my personal favorite was My name is Chuck and I like to...party."
"Its like they weren't even trying. My name is Marty, and I like to partyBuck, not Chuck.No no, you can't say Buck on tv.I can't find it, but from Anchorman there is a TV edit that says I'm Ron Burgundy, you're a dirty bitch San Diego. Instead of go fuck yourself San Diego. It's actually funnier. Oh the best one for last. It was almost over, and I thought they would miss it.TV censoring always brings me back to Mr. Show...you mother-father Chinese dentist![Links monkey-father! Do you speak it?!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CpAE9c1lN8&t=82s)I thought Smokey and the Bandit was always the funniest... they got FRED FLINTSTONE to dub over Jackie Gleeason. Cracked up everytime he said **Scumbum** instead of *Sum'bitch*To be fair, Fred Flintstone was modeled after Jackie Gleeason's character from The Honeymooners.  The VA likely had to be able to do a pretty decent Gleeason impression.The first replacement I ever heard was [Melon Farmer](http://YouTu.be/ZkSgsArrh_k).Not included, [Strike this Guy out](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAA2KxYyfYU#t=27) from Major LeagueWalter's next line was See what happens Larry? See what happens when you invite a stranger over for spaghetti?Dumb and Dumber on TBS takes the cake."
"Show me where to sign!"
"Right on my sandwich after you kiss it!"
"Also... Editing out the headlamp boobies seemed pitiful too.I was praying the sandwich line was in the video.My name is Buck...And I'm here to party.-Kill Billi kinda wanna know what happens when you find a stranger in the alps. But...he shows you exactly what happens when you do. You share cocoa!Or goat cheesePM me your address then. [deleted]Your corvette gets smashed. Weren't you watching?My favorite is Tom Hanks line in Catch Me If You Can when he tells a knock knock joke."
"Movie:"
"Who's there? ... Go fuck yourself."
"TV:"
"Who's there? ... Go flog yourself.its like they're not even trying. When ABC aired Mallrats, it seemed like every one of Jay's lines was dubbed over. [Mallrats on ABC](http://viewaskew.com/tv/abcrats/)Mallrats had some of the best dubs in movie history."
"The entire scene about how Brody farts when he's relaxed, hence his flatulent related blowjob becomes a story about him vomiting because when he's relaxed he gets sick.  Parts of the movie become completely nonsensical."
"All it took was a fat chronic blunt! becomes All it took was a fast karate punch! completely ignoring the fact that two dudes are passed out and surrounded by junk food.Harry Enfield's take on this is pretty good with [*Badfellas*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmRTUNh1vPo)."
"I'm surprised the infamous TV edits of *Robocop* weren't included: [some examples here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pjThvRQ0gs) and [some others here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAoiMk_9Q5Q), though I haven't found the other edit where the line one time I even called him... 'asshole' was changed to one time I even called him... a lot worse. There's also the scene where the car is driven *around* the toxic waste-covered Emil instead of splashing straight through him.This should include the version of The Matrix censored by ABC.  Instead of saying Jesus Christ, that thing was real? when they pull the bug out of Neo, he says Jeepers Creepers, that thing was real?Snakes on a Plane and Lebowski win this category.Pineapples can be kind of dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.I wish I could find a clip of it, but in the end of Speed, Keanu Reeves has his gun pointed and intensely says, Pop quiz, asshole. When they aired it on Fox, they changed it to Pop quiz, ^animal! The funny thing is that the voice was nowhere near the same. It was higher pitched and way too excited.Do Americans really do this? It must be horrible to watch such a movie.Haha yeah anything before 10 is censored. It's why hbo is so popular.Sometimes they're great, like the stranger in the Alps.  My personal favorite is from Half Baked though.  I used to suck feet for coke.I wouldn't recommend watching a movie on TV unless it's a premium channel where they will change it very little if at all. FX plays a lot of good movies but they butcher them with this censorship. Also, they change the aspect ratio to fit the 16x9 screen which degrades the picture quality. I wish they wouldn't do either of those things. Most people who watch FX are probably adults, so I don't see a reason for changing the dialogue so much. One word: sponsors.For cable channels it is a decision made by the network. Late night you generally still movies with swears. They censor a lot more during the daytime.Yeah but it's not just in America. Canada does it just as much. HBO and SHOtime have movies without language edits[removed]I don't even know why someone thought Pulp Fiction would work on TV. Oh lets edit what this movie is famous for, the violence and the dialogue.Mr.Show - Pallies - YouTube"
"www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqjBbpS3HW8"
"Parody of a scene in the movie Goodfellas. As a non-American. Can anybody explain to me why ''bullcrap'' is okay to say on TV but not ''bullshit''?My personal favorite, which I use too often:"
"40 Year Old Virgin"
"Let's get some fucking french toast!"
"Let's get some Denny's french toast!to be fair, the alps can get pretty roughMy favorite was always melon farmer instead of mother fucker in die hard 3I remember Howard Stern made a deal where Private Parts had to have the old 'beeps' for censorship when it aired on TV.  So much better than awful dubbing."
"They are missing the second Resident Evil movie when the guy says mothafucka please, my shit is custom. I think they changed it to  motivator please, my stuff is custom.I'm pretty sure we don't censor films on TV over here in the UK. I'm happy about that.Oh yes we do. It's not as prevalent as in the States but I've seen it a few times.That's really strange. The BBC got away with saying cunt and fuck excessively in The Thick of It and that's a publicly funded channel that is basically channel 1I have a hard time watching the Shawshank Redemption on TV anymore because of all the censorship.My favorite was from Lethal Weapon after Riggs gets hit with the shotgun blast, gets up and says we'll bury the feisters!...did a double take on that oneFar from the Funniest movie lines. A lot of arnold schwarzenegger movies have some hilarious movie line censored.Who ever thought it would be a good idea to put Pulp Fiction on network TV?They wanted to appeal to the kids, but they still had to think of the children.cancel trip to the Alps, checkThis is why I don't watch movies when they're on TV. After the first censored line, I can't take it seriously anymore.In Resident Evil the constant use of motherfucker' gets dubbed over to motivator.  Hilarity ensues.   Motivator, please!   My stuff is custom.  Ha!It's quite ironic that the word sloppy is the most sloppiest dubover Why do we Censor? What's the actual benefit of censoring? Everyone I know also know all the cursewords they are censoring, I just don't get it."
"Is a childs mind that is exposed to curse words early in life going to develop in a criminal mastermind or something?I want this job.When you find a stranger in the alps?! HahahaThe Pineapple Express TV edit uses casserole for asshole throughout the entire movie. It's hilarious. Way better than the original in my opinion. Here's the only link I could find. Sorry about the shitty quality. http://youtu.be/KcIFMbyyEHU[This](http://youtu.be/iY7D6rKjoKM?t=15s) is my vote for funniest movie line censoring. (Shaun of the Dead)can't watch at work, but tell me This is what happens when you meet a stranger in the Alps was in there...Man, I sure am getting a lot of shout outs in this thread.THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS LARRY!!! THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FIND A STRANGER IN THE ALPS!!![deleted]I want my mutual funded money! -Sam Jackson, Jackie Brown.  Your process is all tv'd up! -Brad Pitt, 12 MonkeysI watched the Matrix on AMC, and they censored out Jesus Christ and replaced it on different occasions with juvenile delenquent, jeepers creepers, and Judas Priest.  It was Mr.Falconing rediculous!The Watch had some horrible censoring on a version I watched on a plane. The offensive words were replaced by very badly dubbed less offensive words."
"This feels like GUMWas hoping for The Great Outdoors. An argument with everyone telling each other to Blow it out your ass turned into Blow it out your kazoo.I remember some awful ones in the Matrix."
"How about I give you the flipper, and you give me my phone call."
"Jeepers creepers that thing's real?When you find a stranger in the Alps? Seriously?Wow movies get redubbed for for TV in america?? lol america is so sloppyCan't wait for The Wolf of Wall Street to join these soon.I would have thought that if a stranger were missing in the Alps, I would happily help the search and rescue effort. Now, I'm not so sure.[Funky Pete](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY7D6rKjoKM)If there was a book about funny movie lines being censored, it would be called A Stranger In The Alps I love the Lebowski one. Also in the Kill Bill series, when Kiddo gets shot in the knee; WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU JUST SHOOT ME WITH? becomes WHAAAAAAAT DID YOU JUST SHOOT ME WITH?See what happens when you find a stranger in the Alps?!I was fucking him -->  I was having sex with him."
"Ahh yes, that's much better. Now that line is much more appropriate.Jeese, if I found a stranger in the Alps I'd hope for some appreciation, not having my car windows bashed in.I love it when they censor asshole. They'll say ass but not hole. Monday to Friday plane? That's better than the original.On a flight to Bahrain I was watching Anchorman. A whale's vagina became a whale's falafel and any instance of breasts or boobies became tomatoes.Still missing the Lethal Weapon"
"You're a Slug in a Ditch Riggs!You went full simple... you never go full simple."
"That totally ruined Tropic Thunder for me.Slug in a ditch!love how he says monday - fridayTIL plan trips to the Alps so that you only meet people you knowI remember robocop having a pretty ridiculous one too.

Socks.What's that stuff we used to eat all the time back in the day?......pudding!The Exorcist was one of the first **seriously** R-rated movies to make it to broadcast TV and was so heavily censored, it completely changed what was widely regarded as the the scariest movie made to date.  This scene was my favorite:"
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxofWN8BAoc"
"It was replaced with [Spoiler text here](/s Your mother sews socks that smell.)How is the line from Kill Bill I'm Buck and I like to party not in this video?I heard a good one years ago when I was watching Back to the Future on TV."
"When this baby hit 88 mph, you're going to see some serious *cheese*.I watch Pulp Fiction when it comes on TV just to see what kind of hot mess it's going to be.  Last time it was on AMC and motherfucker --> mother hubbard.  Really?  Not even mothertrucker?  It's quite a jump to be referencing nursery rhymes.Hahaha at least here in argentina i don't recall a censorship so silly as those hahaI think Reddit should coin the phrase from the comments:"
"> So stranger in the Alps is euphemism for anal sex, isn't it?Swearing: absolutely not, Mr Thomson. Edit out all these foul words at once!"
"But what about the violence, sir?"
"What about it, Mr Thomson?"
"Should I edit *that* out, too?"
"What the devil?! Why?! Absolutely not! In fact, give me 4 more gallons of blood in this shot, we want the patio to be *slick*! Slick I tell you!As an Aussie this is really strange. We never get censored. It just seems pointless. Is that why people hate the FCC?Remind me not to find a stranger in the AlpsI just wonder how Wolf of Wall Street is gonna be like.i think if you found a stranger in the alps you'd make good friends [Kill Bill edit should be on this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePB8ZOv--bE)Never find a stranger in the Alps That last one with john Goodman was better dubbed.

"This almost makes me angryI remember seeing Freddie got fingered on cable thought it was funny then a year or two ago saw it uncensored totally different movie.> Stuff you."
"Tom Servo?That must be terrible having movies/shows censored on TV. I still remember watching South Park uncensored on TV, I just can't imagine it being censored!Dat AlpsI was getting too close to the end and hadn't seen The Big Lebowski on there. About to come in here and ask how it could be left off the list. But there it was, last but certainly not least and still hilarious. I always used to love when Die Hard 2 came on TV -- it has some of the most hilariously bad swear edits I have even heard... the Mr. Falcon is the most famous, but the TV edit of that movie is comic gold from beginning to end.Most of those were Samuel L. Jackson and Sharon Stone. Now I want to see a movie with both of them. It'll be a different movie when they show it on tv!UK TV don't even bother any more - a big thrill as a teen in the early 1990s was working out what the line was originally.  Yippie Kai Ay Kimosabi from Die Hard and Forget you, forget you, forget you from Robocop were always my favourites.Remind me to never meet a stranger in the Alps..It isn't on youtube, but I have a TV version of Repo Man where when Otto says Fuck That/Flip that to Leila asking what about our relationship, she says YOU NEEERRRRD! instead of You Asshole!One of my favorite ones (which was not in this compilation) is the TV version of Pineapple Express. When Craig Robinson says mothafucka it gets replaced by mucka-luckaCensorship is such bull spit! But in all seriousness I think its disrespectful to the creator and everyone involved, a piece of media deserves to be seen in the way the creator intended.lol You see what happens, larry, when you find a stranger in the alpsWhy would you even try to adapt Casino or The Departed for regular TV? You might as well just put up a placard on the screen for 2 hours that says Watching this movie on this channel is pointless. Go rent the video for God's sake.My favorite is in 21 Jumpstreet. Get in the fucking car changes to Get in the fancy car. Robocop had a great one where the guy shoots at Robocop saying Fuck me over and over.  In the edited version he says Why me over and over."
"Also, the infamous scene of the guy getting hit by a car after he was doused in toxic waste just has them serve around him.My eyes are wide focused open is by far the most believable and impressive one. i hope i never get lost in the AlpsI wish I could find a video of this scene censored:"

"It replaces the word shit with SCUM and he yells it really loudly. Son of a gum-chewing funk monster! Why the fruit does all this funny stuff happen to me?"
"Forget my life!"
"Always surrounded by miserable failing clods, like this whole world decides to bend me over and find me in the Alps, like i'm some sort of shlock receptacle! Well, as far as I care, these miserable cows can have a fancy barbecue WITH A GODDAMN PIG!The Big Lebowski one is intentionally bad. The Coens thought it would be funny if they came up with really ridiculous substitutions for the abundant profanity in the film, knowing that the studio would edit really shitty overdubs of other voice actors for the tv version anyway.When you find a stranger in the Alps made me actually laugh, that was fantastic."
"This is a thing of the past right?"
"They don't still do this?"
"I remember (here in Australia), they used to do crap like this (I wish I could remember what they replaced 'Fucked up beyond all recognition' (FUBAR) in Tango and Cash with)... but these days they air movies pretty much as is (I think, I don't really watch TV anymore, so I might be wrong)."
"It seems like way too much effort!I'm kicking my ~~ass~~ butt, do ya mind?! - Liar Liar"
"I was hoping to see this one.I caught the end of Not Another Teen movie playing on MTV, i think.  And Lacey Chabert's line got changed from I give them hand jobs. to I give them back rubs.The pineapple and fairy godmother ones are actually funnier."
"They are all just being lazy, frack the censors with blatant fracking lies about what a word means. yeah, you better edit those dirty words in Basic Instint. Cuz the rest isn't dirty.I remember the find a stranger on the Alps line, needed a new TV after hilarity ensued I've always loved the line from Half-Baked..."
"Original: I sucked cock for coke. You ever suck cock for weed?"
"Comedy Central: I sucked feet for coke. You ever suck feet for weed?Is this for real?"
"Is 'murican TV this pathetic?Charlie's Angels fight scene: http://youtu.be/1LFmkVAENVQ?t=1m48s"
"I watched it on a flight and And that's kicking your ass! was redubbed as And that's kicking you around! with a completely different voice for the new dialogue.that was the lamest dub from *There's Something About Mary*- there's one where Ben Stiller says, you fucking asshole, but they dub it as you frogging ashpole.The Crow: a cop was dubbed to say Bull Flipping Spit!"
"I'll let you figure out the actual line."
"Hint: Bull was the actual first word.Wowow, wait, does that mean in the US the actors have to voice act and record one version for movies and one version for later when it airs on tv?In true lies tv version dude says Jamie Leigh Curtis has an ass like two duck eggs in a napkinI was hoping the Big Lebowski one would be there! That is my all time favorite.Some of these fit well, like saying you're sleeping with someone rather than dropping an f-bomb. But most of them are ridiculous. Reminds me of the [~~SHIT~~ *poop* TUBE^TM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFzTm6fy_zs)well I'm never going to the Alps nowWow, those were some ridiculous plucking edits.In Me, Myself, & Irene, they censor every cuss word with the same mamajama soundbit, regardless of who is saying it in the movie.I want to go back to Lebowski Fest, but this time dressed like a Swiss mountain climber while wearing a name tag that says You Don't Know Me. I wonder what actually happens when you find a stranger in the Alps...Watching 21 Jump Street recently, they changed..."
"Get in the fucking car! to Get in the fancy car!"
"Edit: [Found a video](http://youtu.be/0uwokr3YhK8) (sorry for the quality, not mine), the delivery just makes it hilarious."
"I always love the Needle Neck! one from the Water Boy, and PHONEY POLICE!!! from Pineapple Express.My favorite TV censored line as a kid was the scene in the first Austin Powers after he chokes out the Lucky Charms guy and when Tom Arnold sees I'm head down in the toilet. It was changed from Jesus Christ boy! What did you eat?! to Holy Shmolies boy! What did you eat?! Caught me off guard and laughed for a good straight 10 minutes.Last time I found a stranger in the Alps, we had a wonderful time. Local fellow, showed me around... You ever suck feet for weed?Reminds me of an old Doug Benson joke, where he was watching Kill Bill on TV. The censored line went, My name is Buck, and I like to party. He suggested that they shouldve changed his name to Marty.So uh, what happens if you find a stranger in the Alps?I'm surprised nothing from The Blues Brothers was included. The swearing in that is operatic and freaking mandatory, so the dubbed version is a traveshamockery of the highest order. I remember a version of Billy Madison airing on FOX a number of years ago. They changed the line from the flaming dog shit scene to 'He called the poop, poop!'I like how BET used to edit MF with Mickey-fickey, like Next Friday. Classic.Welcome to America. Where's ok to show someone's head getting blown off but don't you DARE say shit on broadcast television!!Just turn you C's into N's. And you can get by the censor. http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iY7D6rKjoKMClearly, it is dangerous to find a stranger in the Alps. What's that stuff? We used to eat it all the time back in the day.. Pudding! That's rightMakes me want to go to Switzerland and find a stranger in the Alps. Die hard in the UK, edited the yippee kai aye mother fucker but left the I didn't just get butt fucked on national television line in.....I'll never forget watching Lethal Weapon 4 on basic cable, the scene where Mel Gibson first confronts Jet Li."
"Uncle Benny: He doesn't speak English."
"Riggs: Oh yeah? Well then he doesn't understand words like... dirtbag or... poopy pants.there is a family friendly version of Casino?? lol have fun editing out the entire movieSome real head scratches thereI dont think all of them are legitReally disappointed that it missed out on Weird Science.  The scene in the jazz bar when Gary mentions that he got kicked in the balls..."
"She kicked him in the nuts and called him a faggot in front of his friends."
"In the family jewels??"
"Becomes:"
"She kicked him in the guts and called him a braggart in front of his friends."
"In the flippin' gizzard??Apparently they had to do double shoots of Dexter in case something other than Showtime wanted to air it in the future and Jen Carpenter especially had to be like YOU PEANUT BUTTER SANDWICHI have never seen this done in any film on TV.TIL not to find a stranger in the alps.This is what happens Donny! This is what happens when you feed a Walrus Scrambled Eggs!a stranger in the Alps??? What would that even MEAN.Freak this.I can't believe there is nothing from Tremors on there. Some of the best dubbed lines. I liked Harold & Kumar where vaginamcginestein turned into very big loser Should've included the other censored edit of the fuck a stranger in the ass from The Big Lebowski:"
"See what happens when you feed a stoner scrambled eggs?Money Talks on TV is impossible to watch.The Matrix: Wow that sounds like a great deal. But I got a better one. How about I give you a flipper, and you give me my phone call."
"Later on after they suck the bug out of his stomach: JEEPERS CREEPERS THAT THING'S REAL??So *thats* what happens when you find a stranger in the alps...  I was always curious.My names Buck and I like to *party*.

"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcIFMbyyEHUhere's a synonym for fornication:  forget you!That's ridiculous as duck.YES! I was hoping Mr. Falcon would be on there.I won't even bother watching certain movies, like The Hangover, for example, on TBS or TNT for this reason. What's up my negro??"
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNjHtV-spI0Are they funny just because most of them have fuck, cunt, or cock in them? Because they missed one of the funniest ones from _Clueless_ (1995):"
"Before: Actually the P.C. term is 'hymenally challenged'."
"After: Actually, the P.C. term is 'hermetically sealed'.I remember seeing Robocop at a bar in spain in the 80's and the scene where the guy with the shotgun is robbing the liqueur store. In the original Robocop enters and the guy starts shooting him saying fuck me, Fuck me, fuck me, the version i saw had the guy saying Fly me, Fly me, Fly me. Seemed utterly pointless when you have a scene with a guy having his hand blown off and another guy covered in toxic waste being destroyed by a moving car. They're good, but they're not as good as [*Shaun of the Dead* replacing every fuck with funk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY7D6rKjoKM&feature=kp)...they changed the word retarded to mentally disabled for family guy on netflix. Can anybody tell me why they would do that, especially on netflix You see what's happens Larry?  Lol...that's my favorite.  Awesome movie too!  never knew they censored movies before, we don't have that over here.You see what happens when you find a stranger in the alps?"
"Never heard that one. I can't imagine The Big Lebowski playing on TV. There's like 200 fucks in the script.One of my personal favorites is from Speed"
"Keanu Reeves speaking to Dennis Hopper"
"Original line: Fuck you mother fucker"
"Edited line: Forget you my friend!"
"The danger of giving lifts to sherpas clearly illustrated here.See what happens when you find a stranger in the alps!You forgot [Funky Pete!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY7D6rKjoKM)That is exactly what happens when you find a stranger in the alps.On a TV edit of Kick-Ass, Hit-Girl goes I'm just flopping with you Daddy.My favorite TV edit that no one talks about, probably because no one else has seen it, is when Grind (that one skateboarding movie) was on ABC Family."
"One part had a character giving another a pep talk, saying I thought you had balls and replacing it with I thought you had THINGS."
"Later on, someone got stuck in a port-a-potty or something.  You're covered in shit was replaced with You're covered in THINGS  Using the same exact sound byte from the previous edit.Here's the kicker - often if you have the closed captioning on it will have the original dialogue. Like one of the Friday the 13th movies -  it was New Blood I believe - guy is opening presents and in the audio he says 'Witch.' (I think.) But the subtitles reveal his true feelings: 'Cunt.'You forgot the worst one of all, Pineapple Express:"
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQKp8KIkIzsI wish I found them funny. I really do. But I don't - not really. There's no reason why this stuff should be censored for everyone. The Japanese can pixelate naughty bits at will. That's their choice. With just a five second delay, a swear word can become a bleep, even on prime-time network TV. How is it a cable box can't overlay a bleep or a blur if I ask it to? Why doesn't this just come down to parental settings?Is this an American thing? I cant remember ever watching a film on tele wih rhe language censored, and it seems rather odd that it happens with films like Casino.....do they censor words but keep the hammer, baseball bat, and vice scenes in?When you find a stranger in the alps???  Everyone knows your St. Bernard gives him a little shot from his little barrel; you don't bash in his windshield with a crowbar, Walter.They missed Die Hard and Live Free. Samuel Jackson calls someone a 'racist mother fucker' which on TV is changed to a 'racist melon farmer'  which kinda makes sense.I can't find it anywhere, but there's a TV edit of The 40 Year Old Virgin where Seth Rogan says I don't give a GOAT Why do they show a movie like Scarface in the first place? That thing is full of profanity.I actually like the Scarface-dubbing more than the original."
"I mean, it's *creative*. This reminds me of a Die Hard 3 edit that I love. Bruce Willis manages to seriously offend some young men with his sign that says, I hate everybody.As much as I hate bowdlerisation, some of the substitutions (the writing, not the audio splicing) were, I gotta reluctantly admit, quite clever, actually. So while I hate that this is being done to works of art, this does at least prove that the people who did this weren't stupid.See what happens when you find a stranger in the alpsstranger in the alps has always been my favorite, maybe because its the only one I actually remember.Mr. Show: Pallies"
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n-rGnI9XNo&feature=kpMy all time favorite edited for TV movie is Fargo. They dub in Fruzin for every instance of the F bomb. It turns the movie into a complete farce. Haha wow some of the euphemism were real badI personally liked one from 21 Jump Street"
"Get in the car"
"Uh, why?"
"I said, get in the *fancy* car!*if you havent seen pineapple express on cable television....boy do i have news for you. they recreated lines are ridiculous. like motherfucker is mothaluckaI saw Kill Bill on tv and the line My name is Buck and I like to Fuck was changed to My name is Buck, and I like to... PARTY.  I partying lost it!If there is one film that would struggle with these edits it would be robocop My personal favorite is in Liar Liar. When the guy on the witness stand yells alright, alright I humped her brains out...are you happy?! And they edited it to alright, alright I kissed her brains out...are you happy!?"
"My friends and I  always quote this."
"One that's probably worse was when they changed Jew motherfucker to Jew money lover in the edited version of Casino.I love when AMC shows the You Jew money lover you. versionYippy ki-yay Mr Falcon. What?Casino also turned motherfucking bullshit into mickey mouse bull spitsecond favorite movie of all time: Pulp Fiction"
"favorite movie of all time: Pulp Fiction edited for TVI think what's even funnier is when you've seen a movie on TV and you find a line that's is just so absurd you wonder what it actual was before they censored it. Then you watch the movie and find out that the line was not censored at all.  For me, it the [sack of wine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIOMXWIF95w).I hate it when you find a stranger in the Alps...What about Goodfellas where What do I amuse you monologue, where they started using the word monkey instead of fuck?"
"Can't find a video of it though.My favourite will still be Pineapple Express:"
"motherfucker - muckka luckka"
"asshole - casserole That one from Casino was unbelievably awful. TBL had me dying of laughter.>See what happens when you find a stranger in the Alps?!"
"Remind me to never join a search and rescue mission in the Alps.Reminds me of the Taco Bell/Pizza Hut switch in Demolition Man. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpRzusd9Yi8 Dumb and Dumber changed BullShit for a pit bull-shih tzu mix inro calling it a BullShoot. Also in Independence Day Will Smith says some to the effect of,  You really think you can do all that bullshit you just said? . One TV edit renders is as just and extended Buuuuull. Its quite funny. That was depressing. Why don't you just show the real one. A lot of these were funny, but some of these were really generic and common line changes.They missed the matrix movie, the changed how about I give you the finger to how about I give you the flipperI wonder if the Speak and Spell got a credit on the departed?God bless America.I was getting ready to add the Lebowski censor. That one had me laughing for a while when I saw it on TV for the first time. Lebowski takes the cake.It's a well known fact that meeting a stranger in the Alps never turns out well. My name is Buck, and I'm here to partyYou call that an addiction? I used to suck feet for coke!I'M SO SCARED OF STRANGERS IN THE ALPS.They certainly did save the best for last. I cannot think of ANY context in which finding a stranger in the alps would tie into this movie. Matrix-take that blue pill and shove it in his ear.I watched Dumb and Dumber on TBS once and the part when Harry tells the joke about him breeding a bulldog and a shitsu it came out as We called it a bullshoot.  Killed the joke immensely.Quick question.  I get that these movies are censored for basic cable but is it to show them before a certain time (like watershed in the UK) or do you seriously have to pay to hear swear words?we would be"
"SLOPPY"
"are you calling us"
"SLOPPYIn the one in X-Men First Class is the best one. When they go talk to Logan,  he normally says Go f*ck yourselves, so naturally I thought it would be changed to Go screw yourselves, but no, it was  Go frack yourselves. Frack.I was really hoping to see Kill Bill.  So your names buck huh? ...and you like to PARTY.... Huh?When you find a stranger in the alps. This made me laugh way too hard. I had never seen the TV version. I couldn't stop laughing at the tv version of 21 Jump Street. I swear they just dubbed over Ice Cube completelythis wasn't on the list but it really belongs here.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_wBtVN6bXEThis is so funny. Thanks!Vulgar language, nestled amidst scenes of hyper violence. Of course, its the language that's an issue.There is no gratitude for finding strangers in the Alps.I don't even have my own piece of tin; I have to envy yours.How come the Sam Jackson edits still sound exactly like him, yet the ones for all the others sound like different voices? So much Sam Jackson hahaNo Tremors?See what happens when you find a stranger in the alps? My favorite is in The Professional. Gary Oldman's character shouts I'm tired of this Mickey-Mouse boot-squash My favorite is the TV version of Crank, with Jason Statham. In one scene, he angrily asks if he has CUNT written on his forehead, coupled with a visual gag of it popping up while he says it."
"In the edit, he shouts something like do I have *goose* written across my forehead!?, but they left the written word cunt."
"It's graaand. It reminds me of how hot Sharon Stone was back in the day.[My name is buck, and I'm here to *party*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePB8ZOv--bE)America, you don't want to be hated? ^Are ^you ^even ^trying?In Watchmen, they change goddamn to goshdamn. One character also tells another to watch his language for saying something is bull spit or something like that.Back in the 90s, when I had to watch movies on Cable, I used to hate it when they would cut scenes and modify dialogue."
"No time like the present :)I love finding strangers in the alps. Especially Europeans, They're ever so friendly. [Mother father, Chinese, dentist!](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-n-rGnI9XNo)They missed my favourite from Back to the Future:"
"*Jeez Louise, Doc! Jeez Louise, you disintegrated Einstein!*Wish they put [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQKp8KIkIzs) in there.[Everything was fine with our system until the power grid was shut off by dickless here.](http://youtu.be/uDOi034BEJY)That was so bad I couldn't even get 45 seconds into it.It's missing my favorite!"
"Keanu's Pop quiz, *animal* from **Speed**."
"The bolderized asshole is just so poorly done and inconsistent with the rest of the sound/tone of the line it makes me laugh every time.You know what else could draw a crowd? A golfer with an arm growing out of his FACE."
"-Happy Gilmore TV versionBreakfast Club Theatrical: Just bury your head in the sand and wait for your fucking prom!"
"Breakfast Club Televised: Just bury your head in the sand and wait for your fancy prom!"
"Breakfast Club Theatrical: Did you slip her the hot beef injection?"
"Breakfast Club Televised: Did you slip her the hot wild affection?I wanted to see 'prink' from Shaun of the Dead! On the tv version of 21 jump street the guy says get in the fancy car instead of get in the fucking car. That's probably my favorite so far'The Price is Wrong.. BOBBY'My favorite of all time actually was an improvement from the original line. In A Night at the Roxbury Mr. Zadir frequently asks his assistant if he grabbed his ass, but the for TV version changes the line to: Did you grab my tush? I don't know why but tush just fits his character so much better and makes the interaction hilarious.A couple of these if edited a bit better wouldnt be too badI feel like monkey-fighting snakes would've been exciting. I would totally watch it. Snakes Fighting Monkeys on a Plane.Can anyone find the a censored version of Rush Hour where Jackie says to some guys in a pool hall Wassup my nigga? but instead he says Wassup my neeegroo?No breakfast club? The censored for TV version of Blazing Saddles is utterly unwatchable. When you find a stranger in the Alps? They actually did this on Television? like for real? hahahahahaha thats even funnier ahhahahahaha ROFLMy favorite that didn't make the cut: Thurgood Jenkins in Half Baked - Yeah, get me a box of condoms, and, what was that thing we used to eat back in the day? What was it... oh yeah, pussy/pudding.I came here hoping for Home Alone. I wouldn't let you sleep in my room if you were living on my *butt*.  Nothing too funny but always stuck out to me.[Mr. Show's take on edited for TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqjBbpS3HW8)This just pisses me off.[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzQEPOXJtqE) is all I could think of while watching this."
"source: Team Four Star DBZ AbridgedMy name is Buck and I like to ^^party.Came for the monkey fighting snakes, was not disappointed.Does Cheech and Chong's Next Movie take the cake since they had to basically make two movies for two different mediums?In 'I Love You, Man' they censor 'asshole' with 'armhole.'> Hey everybody! We're all gonna take a shower!"
"I remember this one from Caddyshack. The original line was Hey everybody! We're all gonna get laid!They forgot some from one of my favorites, Pineapple Express, here's an edit changing asshole to casserole http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CQKp8KIkIzsOh my God, I definitely saw the TV version of the Big Lebowski. I remember that moment and thinking Find a stranger in the alps? What the fuck does that mean?why would they censor Pulp Fiction, Just dont run it on TV In Half Baked the line is supposed to be about sucking dick for coke but is edited to suck feet for coke. Quite hilarious. I thought for sure they would include the [terribly hilarious Strike this mother fucker out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAA2KxYyfYU&feature=kp) from Major League.They edited out the farting scene in *Blazing Saddles* ...Not to mention the ballet scene in Top Secret.Right on my SANDWICH after you kiss it!Just listing 17 movie lines that were censored doesn't automatically make them the funniest ones. Some of them were just changing the word and they still made sense in context."
"I remember watching Caddy Shack on TV and hearing, Let's all go get laid! (followed by everybody cheering and running out of the room) changed to, Let's all go take a shower. Which, made me laugh but also later when I thought about it, I noticed it also implied they were all going to take a shower together (bunch of young, male caddies) that it was even funnier."
"Edit: a wordI remember seeing the Eddie Murphy/Tim Robbins movie *Nothing to Lose* and [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCnRrguVvJ4) had all the fucks replaced with hecks; it was hilarious because they're all shouting so you can easily read their lips, but the heck is overdubbed and so goofy.I was waiting for the Die Hard - Mr. Falcon line. My friends and I used to joke about that constantly... I don't even think that there was a Mr. Falcon in the movie."
"Incomplete, doesn't have my favorite of all time. Asshole~>Casserole.The edit from we're not dating, we're fucking to we're not dating, we're having sex really demonstrates the absurdity of it all.I had a conversation about some of these just this weekend.  I always wondered what the point was behind the edit on *The Big Lebowski*; it's not an incredibly tight shot.  They could've dubbed damn near anything in there and you wouldn't really be able to tell.I was waiting for the Big Lebowski, so glad they found a stranger in the alpsWayne's World. If Benjamin were an ice cream flavor, he'd be Mocha Almond Idiot.I've never been able to get a clip to prove to people."
"Saw The Matrix on TV once. In the classic lobby scene where Neo reveals all his guns after going through the metal scanner. Originally, the guard says, holy shit!!"
"The edit changes it to, holy ^^SMOKES!! in one of the worst dubs I've ever heard. I also love the TV edit of Panic Room:"
"Mom! Swear!"
"fff-hell.Haha, my friends and I been quoting Walter finding strangers in the alps for years.Guys I'm really excited for when they try to make a cable version of The Wolf of Wall Street.I find it hard to watch films that are edited from the original man.. Language is meant to be meaningful.How in the world did they censor Casino?As a German I find the concept of censoring films for TV really weirdMore pleaseDoing a voice over for Casino, you might as well just remake the movie. The Exorcist: Your mother sucks dicks in hell"
"Edited on TV to: Your mother sows socks in hellSlug in a ditch!I can't believe nobody has brought up Patton Oswalt's [Clean Filth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuK9IUK5I5I)My favorite of these is the immigration scene from Scarface."
"The immigration office gives Tony a hard time about his scar, suggesting that he got it by eating pussy. But the edit makes the insult way funnier."
"Where'd you get that scar? Eating Pineapple?"
"The implication is that Tony is SO STUPID that he doesn't realize that you need to cut open a pineapple before you try and eat it. Jack Nicholson in The Shining: I love the little son of a buck!This is what happens when you give him scrambled eggsNothing to loose should be on thisMy sister and I watched a lot of these movies on cable growing up. We'd say Mr Falcon and Freak You in lieu of swear words regularly and they actually caught on with some of our friends in middle school. We even named our macaw Mr. Falcon and taught him how to say yippee-kay-ay (which was harder than it sounds actually.) I like the ones from Half Baked."
"Original line: Go pick me up some condoms and that stuff... used to eat it all the time back in the day. Oh yeah! Pussy."
"Edited: Go pick me up some condoms and that stuff... used to eat it all the time back in the day. Oh yeah! Pudding."
"Original Line: I sucked dick for coke. You ever suck dick for marijuana?"
"Edited: I sucked feet for coke. You ever suck feet for marijuana?I saw Cheech and Chong's Nice Dreams on TV a long time ago, and they replaced all mentions of marijuana with diamonds.I found a stranger in the Alps once.I thought bullcrap was the way the script was written for Mary. Those headlights thoMy favorite was always Half Baked."
"Yeah, get me a box of condoms, and, what was that thing we used to eat back in the day? What was it... oh yeah, pussy."
"Became: Yeah, get me a box of condoms, and, what was that thing we used to eat back in the day? What was it... oh yeah, puddin'"
"Im sick of the Mickey mouse bull squashNo wonder many of these movies didn't make sense as a kid.They forgot about Buck and how he likes to party.One of my favorites was Sam L. in Jackie Brown, in the AK47 scene. They replaced it with AK-47. When you absolutely, positively got to kill every mother's father in the room, accept no substitutes. The end of Top Gun, edited for NBC in the late 80's had this gem:"
"ICEMAN: YOU CAN BE MY WING MAN ANY DAY.."
"MAVERICK: ..... *no way*..... YOU CAN BE MINE."
"The ...no way.... didn't even sound like Tom Cruise, which made it even funnier."
"Oh boy, remind me to never talk to a stranger in the alps.Oh boy, remind me to never talk to a stranger in the alps.I found a sloppy pineapple in the alps onceI didn't need to click the link to know DO YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FIND A STRANGER IN THE ALPS was there.I wish my favorite big lewbowski one was on there! You see what happens when you feed a stork scrambled eggs!?Really takes out the substance in a movie.yeah, FUCK censorship. That shit's fucking stupid. Better not get lost in the alps.Lebowski on tv has a whole new level of funny. I would have added the old TV edit of *Die Hard: With a Vengeance.*"
"Instead of McClane being in Harlem with a sign that says I hate niggers it said I hate everybody."
"One of the most ridiculous edits I can think of."
"I caught the movie on some regular cable channel a few weeks ago, Spike or USA, and I noticed they gave up the 90's bullshit editing and kept the original."
"They missed yeah, you like that? You fucking retard?My favorite was from CaddyShack. They changed, Hey everyone, we're all gonna get laid! to: Hey everyone, let's go take a shower!I guess it's better than bleeps? I'm not sure although watching Kat Williams on Comedy central censored was just like one long emergency test system bleep.Well I never want find a stranger in the alps.You Scuzz Bucket from Smokey and the Bandit has always been one of my favorites.I heard casserole...Fast Times at Ridgemont High"
"Spicoli's Surfer Dream."
"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKrpl-KBTzQ"
"On tv they always censor out the line those guys are fagsThese... These are just terrible!See what happens Larry?! See what happens when you find a stranger in the Alps?!Edited National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1, Emilio Estevez tells Tim Curry his worst nightmare is waking up without his _piano_.NO fruzzin' way. No fargo? I am disappoint.I remember the TBS cut of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure being full of these weird little gems. I found a stranger in the alps the other day...Nothing can beat the TV edit for Darkman.  They replaced Take the fucking elephant!  with Take the fuzzy elephant!They forgot the rape scene from Thelma and Louise."
"Original says Well suck my cock"
"TV version was Well clean my clockI can't find it, but I saw Silence Of The Lambs on TV once and they dubbed I'd have me... I'd have me so hard while the lips were CLEARLY saying fuck. That one was pretty bad.Blazing Saddles on AMC.  The campfire fart scene was completely silent.  Unbelievable.  The running man had a great one. That boys one mean motherfucker. Turned into that boys one mean man of flesh.SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FIND A STRANGER IN THE ALPS!?the big lebowski one at the end had me dyingThe big labowski ones are funny as a good fartYippie Kai Yay, Melon Farmer.This is what happens when you feed a stoner scrambled eggs!I have found myself curious on numerous occasions as to what happens when you find a stranger in the alps..I find it boring somehow...Not a movie, but still the best (and most ironic) censor job [ever](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECE27vtp4WU)When you find a stranger in the Alps?"
"HA!"
"The Alps?I've never understood why they don't just bleep curse words. Or whatever it's called when they just trim the audio out. Find a Stranger in the Alps is probably my favorite ever.Some of these don't even seem realTIL to avoid strangers in the Alps.Vacation.  The scene in East St Louis where Clark asks for directions.   Edited is easy funnier IMO"
"Original: man,  go fuck yo mama"
"Edited: Who do I look like?  Christopher Columbo?Funny how they have to censor the words, while showing images of people getting murdered is perfectly fine.

In the unedited cut John McClane is instructed to go into Harlem with a sign that says I HATE NIGGERS but in the TV broadcast they changed the sign to say I HATE EVERYBODY. Makes the whole scene a lot more amusing lol.The Lebowski one is by far the bestShaun of the Dead:"

"P: No it's not. It's funkin' Sunday, and I've got to go to funkin' work, in four funkin' hours, because every other funker in my funkin' department is funkin' ill. Now can you see why I'm so funkin' angry!?"
"E: Funk yeah!"
"[Relevant video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY7D6rKjoKM)the BET edit of Belly is complete comedy gold, especially any thing with DMX.. no way they were matching his voiceAlso in There's Something About Mary, Ben Stiller has a line toward the end where he says You're a fucking asshole! and on TV it was You're a frogging ash-pole!kinda was hoping to see the helicopter scene from Boyz N the Hood hahaDumb and Dumber.

"What does happen when you meet a stranger in the Alps?I was watching 21 jump street the other night on TV and at one point Dave Franco said Get in the *fancy* car and it didn't match his lips or the rest of his voice at all. I can only assume the original line was Get in the fucking car and they did a terrible job censoring it...I hope no one finds a stranger in the alps around me! why would you even bother putting any of these movies on TV if you had to edit themSo if they're monkey-fighting snakes, isn't Sam Jackson indirectly calling himself a monkey?I hope I never find a stranger in the alps. I'm only here to ask OP if the username is a Jamal Smith reference. If so, you are tremendous. If not, I regret to inform you that you may not be as clever as you think.I remember one that wasn't so much funny as pathetic.  *Ordinary People*.  The scene where Timothy Hutton is with psychiatrist Judd Hirsch, and Hutton's character is finally getting some emotion out, in this case, anger.  Hutton says something about Hirsch's wife, and Hirsch says something like What do you think I do with my wife?"
"> Line in theatrical release: I think you go home and you fuck the living daylights out of her!"

"The one that stuck with me was when he ejects from the plane that blows up, and he is screaming, JOOOOOOEEEEE!"
"I cannot wait till Wolf of Wall Street is on basic cable.The best one is missing."
"Die Hard 3, when Bruce Willis has a sign that says I hate everyone."
"And the black guys come up to him...and are all like yo man, why do you hate everyone? Let's kill him!They forgot the muckaluckas from Pineapple Express!haha the last one.Die Hard With a Vengeance has a good one. They change Jackson's You racist mother fucker to You racist melon farmerYou see what happens larry!! You see what happens when you find a stranger in the alps!!"
"I enjoyed the Pulp Fiction ones, it seemed like the  voice overs were done by the actual actors which is always nice. If I was an actor and I knew my shit was going to be censored, I'd volunteer to do the voice over. Nothing ruins a movie like a voice over with a different voice, different background sounds and poor expression. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FIND A STRANGER IN THE ALPS!  Used to scream this shit at people all the time in high school, no one really understood it except the other kids who watched too much basic cable.My personal favorite is the TV cut of happy gilmore -"
"I eat pieces of stuff like you for breakfast!"
"You eat pieces of stuff for breakfast?wide focused open?See what happens Gary?It's missing my favourite, the line from the matrix. Holy Shit->Holy ^smokesI remember when I was a kid seeing one of the Beverly Hills Cop movies on TV and they overdubbed one of Eddie Murphy's lines to be.... Who the damn been in my office?   Not sure what the original line was, probably Who the hell... or Who the fuck...   Regardless, the safe for TV version made me laugh out loud.Talk about Bad Words!"
"Most of those words were totally wrong for those sentences.....When you find a stranger in the alps.....

I think there's one where Arnie was supposed to say Bullshit but they censor him with Bologna.

"16 years ago, I thought Kevin Spacey in American Beauty was a total creep. Now that I am 35, after rewatching it in years, I cant help myself but have empathy for him.Wait until you reach 42. You will realize that you are Kevin Spacey. Can confirm. Am 42 and reading this at work.  Feel like Kevin spacey. More about hating work and wanting to be in shape than lusting over teenagers.Yup. I often think about what I'd need to do so I can stay at home, smoke weed, workout, and garden. The incredibly short amount of time I have left between sleep and work... is just depressing, and I don't even have kids!Try having that little time between work and sleep, having a one year old son and all you want to do is play some Fallout 4 dammit but there just is never any time!Am 36 and in the middle of a midlife crisis. Currently in India. AMA. Have you travelled in mumbai locals or delhi metro. And how do you feel to be around so many people everywhere? So are we to understand your midlife crisis involves a journey of self-discovery and enlightenment throughout India, or is that just where you're from?The former Ok, why India?  What are you doing there?I've been here a couple times before and love the sense of craziness and adventure. So I'm having a lot of crazy adventures. And doing a ton of yoga. Are you from India?  If not, what brought you there?  What's is your profession?Nope I'm an Australian lawyer. I love India. I've been here twice before. It's a great place fr adventure and to be challenged. Also the midlife crisis started as I got heavily into yoga. Do you fuck?Yes I've been in a midlife crisis since I was 12My theory is that the birth of all male crises coincides with that first boner.McDonalds in India. How is that?Never been but they do exist. I've seen commercials. They're indianised so they have things like the mcpaneer which is like a kind of soft cheese they use in place of meat. No beef. They have masala coke here which is basically curry flavour coke. The Indian palette is very different to Western taste. Having said all that the food is the best part of being here. You'd be crazy to go to McDonald's here. They don't serve beef. You can reach your own conclusions from there.I imagine it's a lot like going through a midlife crisis here in the States, only...moister?You end up in a lot more conversations about past lives and balancing your chakras. Which is okay because they often present the possibility of sex with younger women, which as you know is a very large part of midlife crisis. [deleted]What brought you to India and why do you think you'll only live to 72?It's a great place for adventure. It's like being in another, totally crazy world. Also as part of the midlife crisis I got heavily into yoga over the last few years and also have been into meditation for a while. Do you poo in the loo?"
"^^^Sorry.  ^^^Been ^^^on ^^^/r/4chan ^^^all ^^^day.Yes. I have been in India for 3 months and was in Sri Lanka for a month before then. I have only shit in Western style toilets. In fact I think I've only shit in fairly acceptable Western style toilets. I think maybe in a previous trip I've done the hole in the ground toilet a couple times. It's not so bad apart from being an epic quad workout. Thank you Ezekiel."
"^^^And ^^^thank ^^^you ^^^denizens ^^^of ^^^/r/movies ^^^for ^^^having ^^^a ^^^sense ^^^of ^^^humour.I have this same thought literally every day. Work in a 1st world country, save up for retirement, then retire in a 3rd world country. Kind of like how now that I'm an adult I've started identifying more with Triton in The Little Mermaid."
"DADDY, I LOVE HIM!"
"Bitch, you are 16 and you don't even *know* him.Eh, can't they both be wrong? Yeah he was right that she was just infatuated and she didn't know what she was getting into. But he should have listened and taken an interest in her hobby. Instead he blew up all her stuff and pushed her away.Love the moral of that story.  To be worthy of a man you don't even know you should change every aspect of your being and abandon your family and home so that you can never return.  Ariel might as well have joined ISISAt least ISIS doesn't sail over our lands with nets, harvesting our friends for food."
"...yet.> To be worthy of a man you don't even know you should change every aspect of your being and abandon your family and home so that you can never return."
"Yea, its much better in the original where she tortures herself to become human and ends up committing suicide rather than kill the prince... The moral of Grease also seems to be that you should change everything about who you are to get some dude.Then once you do that you realize you just made a big fucking mistakeAAAAAND personality doesn't matter, you don't need to have a conversation with him if you look good.That's the plot of The Little Mermaid 4I like the [Nostalgia Chick's take](http://youtu.be/HVrW7f27Sno) on The Little Mermaid."
"It's essentially about how King Triton learns to be less racist(?) towards humans and lets his daughter go, told from the daughter's point of view. Ariel doesn't change much throughout the story but King Triton does. Didn't she dream of going where the people are and the freedom of running/dancing that feet offered *before* she met the dude?  She collected human artifacts since she was a child.  It was as if she was born in the wrong body/world. I'm sure most people know this already, but the reason the story doesn't add up is because they totally disney-fied the ending. Behaving like that *should* lead to disaster and in the original story it does. Things don't go the way the mermaid imagined. She doesn't get the prince, another woman steals the credit for saving him and the voiceless mermaid is powerless to say it was actually her. She has to watch them fall in love and marry but she can't return to the sea, she's going to die there on land. The witch offers her a way out: if she murders the prince with the witches knife and spills his blood on her legs then her tail will return. The mermaid can't make herself do it. She dies and dissolves into sea foam. There's some christian shit about eternal souls thrown in there as well. Ironically ISIS is doing a good job recruiting young women with just those talking points... Hell, I can't even recruit a young woman with a promise of free dinner and a movie.The honeymoon lasts about one day thereFundamentalism is fundamental.I propose a ban on all merfolk entering the country until we figure out what the hell is going on. DA SEAWEED IS ALWAYS GREENER, IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S LAKEHow is that irony?  Wasn't that his point exactly?Well, it's like rain on your wedding day. Irony.It isn't. He just rewrote the same joke while pointing out the punchline, and making it seem like he was being original. That was exactly his point, but way to disregard it and skew it like you came up with it.Guess Disney did their job.And if you make a deal with the devil, everything will work out just fine in the end."
"Disney movies from that period had the worst messages."
"Beauty and the Beast: if you just love him, he'll quit being an abusive monster and turn into the prince you always wanted."
"Older one,  but the Fox and the Hound: In the end, your race defines you and you should really just stick with your own kind. It's not a judgement on anyone though. You're separate, but *equal*. > I think you should give Beauty in the Beast another watch then. It's more about you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover. Humans are more complicated then good and evil. The beast had a horrible spell put on him that made him act that way. It also shows how people armed with pitchforks can get out of hand. Something reddit knows too much about.The beast had a horrible spell cast on him *because* he already acted that way. The witch made him look hideous to match the hideousness within.Well, according to Disney's telling of Beauty and the Beast, the Beast must have been only 11 when he was transformed by the Enchantress."
"1. The enchanted rose will die on the Beast's 21st birthday."
"2. In Be Our Guest, Lumiere sings, Ten years, we've been rusting."
"You're 11 years old and a [creepy looking stranger danger](https://lebeauleblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/old-beggar-woman.png) shows up at your doorstep. Of course you're not gonna let her into your house. You don't know this lady."
"So he's changed into a monster while he's still just a kid, left to be raised by a fucking clock, a candelabra, and a teapot. He's not really an abusive monster, he's just a child. He may have aged physically, but mentally, he hasn't even had the chance to grow up."
"If anything, I think the story of Beauty and the Beast is actually about the Beast learning to socialize and be an adult.I thought The Fox And The Hound's message was, Society's power structures define race, and you're stuck with it, with the goal of making the next generation want to erase those boundaries.I thought it was them being friends forever. Maybe i watched a different movie. I was too busy crying at the end for my child brain to construe any metaphors..... I'll never watch that movie again No, the moral of the story is two-fold."
"1. As a parent, don't try to force your views on your children. Let them be individuals and you can avoid a whole bunch of pain and suffering. Ariel wouldn't have made a deal with the devil if her father hadn't been overbearing."
"2. As a child, your parents have your best interests at heart and if you communicate with them more and don't make rash decisions when you don't get what you want, you can avoid a whole bunch of pain and suffering. If Ariel would have been more patient with her father, he would have eventually come around and let her be an individual. The story is about a father and daughter power struggle.Quite so. Also, when you screw up, your parents will come to your aid, even if they get into hot water themselves in the process.These aren't exactly original Disney stories. The originals are even ghastlier in most cases.Yes but the originals maintain a good message. Little Mermaid ends with her dying, but it portrays the message that she made the wrong choice. The Disney version makes it seem like she did everything right.She made a wrong choice to become human, but then made the right choice in not kill the Prince."
"Edit: WordSometimes the originals are more graphic, but the moral is better. For example, in the original little mermaid Ariel dies when she splits her fin in half to have legs like people. It's graphic, but the lesson is that you shouldn't change yourself to fit the needs of others. I think that's a pretty good lesson"
"Edit: I got a fact wrong, my bad - she has her legs split in two, causing her horrible pain and eventually she kills herself.But the mermaid didn't get legs to please the Prince. She wanted to become human to get a soul because when mermaids die they become seafoam having no soul to live on in the afterlife."
"You know, that would make for some hella good musical numbers.> splits her fin in half to have legs like people."
"Yikes.."
"Edit:"
"> she has her legs split in two, causing her horrible pain and eventually she kills herself."
"Yikes...The lesson is actually not something Disney would have been (or will be for some time) comfortable designing a movie after."
"It's a love letter by Hans Christiaan Anderson to his friend when the friend got married (to a woman). Hans was pretty torn that his friend was straight and they could never be together even though that's what he wanted more than anything."
"Also the message of the Didney version is more warning against the faustian bargain offered by Ursula. Ultimately it's Triton who sees how much Ariel is willing to risk to be with the prince and sees that he's kinda shellfish for wanting to keep her home like that just because he was afraid to lose her."
"16 wasn't so bad in the old timey days (And I'm pretty sure the prince was 16-18). Nobody complains about Jasmine who's like 14.Did MissPetrova just slip in the 'shellfish' pun without skipping a beat? Wish I could be part of your world. [From the Wikipedia entry:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid)"
">The Little Mermaid dwells in an underwater kingdom with her father (the sea king or mer-king), her dowager grandmother, and her five older sisters, each of whom had been born one year apart. When a mermaid turns 15, she is permitted to swim to the surface for the first time to glimpse the world above, and when the sisters become old enough, each of them visits the upper world one at a time every year. As each returns, the Little Mermaid listens longingly to their various descriptions of the world inhabited by human beings."
">When the Little Mermaid's turn comes, she rises up to the surface, watches a birthday celebration being held on a ship in honor of a handsome prince, and falls in love with him from a safe distance. A violent storm hits, and the Little Mermaid saves the prince from drowning. She delivers him unconscious to the shore near a temple. Here, she waits until a young girl from the temple and her companions find him. To her dismay, the prince never sees the Little Mermaid or even realizes that it was she who had originally saved his life."
">The Little Mermaid becomes melancholy and asks her grandmother if humans can live forever and if they can breathe under water. The grandmother explains that humans have a much shorter lifespan than merfolks' 300 years, but that when mermaids die, they turn to sea foam and cease to exist, while humans have an eternal soul that lives on in heaven. The Little Mermaid, longing for the prince and an eternal soul, eventually visits the Sea Witch in a dangerous section of the ocean. The witch willingly helps her by selling her a potion that gives her legs in exchange for her tongue (as the Little Mermaid has the most enchanting and beautiful voice in the world). The Sea Witch warns that once she becomes a human, she will never be able to return to the sea. Consuming the potion will make her feel as if a sword is being passed through her body, yet when she recovers, she will have two human legs and will be able to dance like no human has ever danced before. However, she will constantly feel as if she is walking on sharp knives and as though her toes are bleeding. In addition, she will obtain a soul only if she wins the love of the prince and marries him, for then a part of his soul will flow into her. Otherwise, at dawn on the first day after he marries another woman, the Little Mermaid will die brokenhearted and disintegrate into sea foam upon the waves."
">The Little Mermaid agrees to this arrangement, and the Sea Witch cuts off her tongue. The Little Mermaid swims to the surface near the palace of the prince and drinks the potion. She is found by the prince, who is mesmerized by her beauty and grace, even though she is considered by everyone in the kingdom as dumb and mute. Most of all, he likes to see her dance, and she dances for him despite suffering excruciating pain with every step. Soon, the Little Mermaid becomes the prince's favorite companion and accompanies him on many of his outings. When the prince's parents order their son to marry the neighboring princess in an arranged marriage, the prince tells the Little Mermaid he will not because he does not love the princess. He goes on to say he can only love the young woman from the temple, who he believes rescued him. It turns out that the princess from the neighboring kingdom is the temple girl, sent there only temporarily to be educated. The prince loves her, and the royal wedding is announced at once."
">The prince and princess celebrate on a wedding ship, and the Little Mermaid's heart breaks. She thinks of all that she has sacrificed and of all the pain she has endured. She despairs, thinking of the death that awaits her, but before dawn, her sisters rise out of the water and bring her a dagger that the Sea Witch has given them in exchange for their long, beautiful hair. If the Little Mermaid slays the prince with the dagger and lets his blood drip on her feet, she will become a mermaid once more, all her suffering will end, and she will live out her full life in the ocean with her family."
">However, the Little Mermaid cannot bring herself to kill the sleeping prince lying with his new bride, and she throws the dagger and herself off the ship into the water just as dawn breaks. Her body dissolves into foam, but instead of ceasing to exist, she feels the warm sun and discovers that she has turned into a luminous and ethereal earthbound spirit, a daughter of the air. As the Little Mermaid ascends into the atmosphere, she is greeted by other daughters who tell her she has become like them because she strove with all her heart to obtain an immortal soul. Because of her selflessness, she will be given the chance to earn her own soul by doing good deeds to mankind for 300 years and will one day rise up into the Kingdom of God.Damn. A much better story.You should act as selfishly as you want, leading to your father being tortured, the entire ocean nearly destroyed by an evil witch to whom you gave power, the love of your life nearly being killed trying to save you...and you'll get absolutely everything you wanted in the first place! *shellfishly*sigh*......take your fucking upvoteThank you,  Sean ConneryWhen I first watched the movie I wonder how a guy could think masturbating in the shower could be the highlight of his day.  Now that I work (in a job I hate) and have a mortgage, and all the other responsibilities associated with being a working man, I understand that now.  Heh... Just watched it two days ago."

"But remember, at the time she was really 19 an married to the 38yr old producerSmooth, Lester. Real smooth.[Cool lester smooth] (https://youtu.be/DchmGutPWzI?t=8)The Wire just applies to everything. Spacey's character is both a creep and worthy of empathy.  He's worked hard but he's getting screwed by 'The American Dream' so he throws in the towel and goes hedonistic.  In real life, when you are pushing 50 and all kinds of shit is going on in your life, it's easy to fantasize about chucking it all and chasing after whatever catches your imagination."
"The character did redeem himself by not nailing Meena's character when he found out she was still a virgin, so there's that.Seems like her age should have been a bigger deal than her virginity.And she acted like a real hoeDid you see the same movie? She wasn't a virgin, she was lying because she thought it would make her seem more attractive to him."
"He did look like he believed her though.I would say he is getting screwed by his wife who hates him.  Really the poison in his life is that he is isolated and taken for granted.  They are pretty well off in the movie, so the american dream part is going fine.Not fucking a 16 year old girl when you're 50 just makes you not a sick fuck. Doesn't redeem you at all.http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2011/12/if_you_liked_the_descendants_y.htmlI think if we were immortal (or just lived for centuries) we'd have to deliberately go through periods where were throw almost everything away and start over or we and society would completely stagnate.  I think our current lifespans are already pretty close to this point.Spacey was 39 when he played that character. Pushing 50?  His character was 42. i saw it as a portrayal of what typically happens to the american dreamThis is the result of a good writer. Lester is a main character and the way to get an audience interested is to make the character relatable, even if they are a creep. Lots of books do this too. You actually start to care about them and even though they do things you think are horrible or just shitty, you can still relate to them in some way."
"Stephen King is really good at this. I have read some of his stories that I just hated but he still makes you care about the characters by giving them depth.There's nothing creepy about men being attracted to girls.  It's in our instincts.  I'm sick of people acting like we should apologize for being born men.  Our instincts and biology don't check IDsYeah, and it's not like she was 13 or anything.[deleted]I understand in modern society there is a big difference, but biologically our bodies are hard-wired to be attracted to post-pubescent femalesHe should have nailed Mena's character since she's in her sexual prime.  Such a disappointment that the didn't.Louis CK reviews American Beauty"
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHiocSoZhEs>The character did redeem himself by not nailing Meena's character when he found out she was still a virgin, so there's that."
"Well it's one thing to chase a dream, but it's an entirely different thing to destroy your worth as a human with a sense of morality.  Spacey's character was sick of pretending to be something he felt he wasn't and went about finding a way to be true to himself.  Fucking Meena would have been just lying to himself about who he felt he was.  Despite all his adventures, I think he found what he was looking for honestly... himself."
"And that's why I think the title is aptly named... because he found what he was looking for finally in the shit storm that was his life.  He found the beauty in it.  It's more complex than that, I feel. Kevin Spacey's character, Lester, is hitting that mid-life crisis, as you mentioned; he is hitting the peak of frustration with his life. At the start of the film, he is wholly disconnected from the most important things in his world. Neither his wife, nor daughter give him any respect, and Lester's work is filled with bullshitters who are all more successful than him despite being terrible employees and liars."
"The events of the film are a catalyst for Lester to seek out the things he wants, and renew himself from the rut he lived in at the start. Mena Suvari's Angela is the motivation for this change; the will to work towards a more confident version of himself."
"At the end, where he unexpectedly succeeds at getting the thing he had wanted the entire movie, the young Angela, he realizes that having sex with this 16 year old hot girl isn't what he actually wants; but to be respected and loved by his family. When Angela reveals that she is still a virgin, reality hits Lester hard, that she is just a kid, the same as his daughter. He instantaneously switches from horny guy to caring father almost immediately."
"That's what makes the ending so tragic. Lester finally finds what he wants, after an entire movie of clouded judgement and acting out. He just wants respect and more control over his world;To be a loving father and strong husband to these women he genuinely care so much for, only for it to all end in a hot flash of confused fear.Does Mena Suvari do any movies that don't start with American?  For me google just lists these:"
"* American Beauty"
"* American Reunion"
"* American Pie"
"* American Pie 2"
"* American Virgin>  to be respected and loved by his family"
"I agree with everything you said, but I wanted to put a finer point on this part: I think what he ultimately wanted was to be proud of himself and who he was. That would have been reflected by respect from his family, but people can't respect someone who doesn't respect himself."
"And you know, the ending being tragic is kind of up for discussion. Some people live a whole long life and never get the kind of self-actualization that Lester Burnham got there near the end (which is truly more tragic). He finally knew who he was and was OK with himself for the first time in his adult life, and died at the top of his game."
"This really was a genius movie. I watched it again recently myself (at 42/F) and I get so much of it. After reading this I think I should watch this movie again, I remember thinking it was ok at the time but now that I am in my 40's it might be a much better movie for me now from my current perspective on life. I haven't seen it, but I feel so sad now. This morning sucks. But I'm totally going to watch it based on your review.  Before you have a family, you pursue your goals and dreams and part of that includes companionship with a spouse or significant other.  But once you form a union with the other person, your goals take a hit.  At first, being a young married couple with a cute kid is euphoric and its own reward.  But if you don't allow the simple pleasures to balance your individual drive, your life can go off the rails.  In a family, the husband wife and kids can all go off the rails if the family isn't aware of the unique and special significance of living and working together as a team.  Instead, what sets in is a zero-sum game mentality where everyone is in competition for resources and time and everyone is chronically disappointed.  That's what Lester went through and he didn't realize it until just before the neighbor blew his brains out."
"When he holds the family photo, he's finally in a place where he can enjoy the moment captured in the photo.  It is his realization of his ideal nature as a member of a family.  Its a snapshot in his past which was gone in an instant, just like his life. Poof!It's more complex then that!  I never thought I would say this.. but you two have smoked your selves retarded. ....."
"Lol that is all I could think of with your opening line! It's a lot like the ending of *Eastbound and Down*. See: https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3w162b/16_years_ago_i_thought_kevin_spacey_in_american/cxsux6eI saw the bullet to the back of the head as the big final reminder of his lack of control.I personally didn't see the ending as tragic, really, actually.  I didn't see that it was a hot flash of confused fear as much as a moment of perfect serenity and acceptance.The hot flash of confused fear is the shooter and his motivation, not spacey.Wanting more control in your life is the quickest way to become profoundly unhappy and angry. Nothing will ever be good enough and nobody will ever give you the respect you think you deserve. You may temporarily achieve it but it's all a illusion. >When Angela reveals that she is still a virgin, reality hits Lester hard, that she is just a kid, the same as his daughter. He instantaneously switches from horny guy to caring father almost immediately."
"The part he wraps her up in that blanket like 'oh no no no way am I doing this' redeems him completely, and solidifies what you wrote about; it was the idea of her and not the actual act of being with her that got him to where he ultimately wanted to be.  The sad thing is the original ending destroys his family. His daughter and Sam are framed for the death and go to prison, destroying their lives."
"They chose the best ending imo.isn*t there an ending where the neighbors wife brings the bloody shirt to the police? Have read that somewhereNot sure - it's possible. I have heard that there are a bunch of original endings but the only one that seems to keep popping up is the one with the kids getting framed. Not sure about the validity of the others."
"I still think they chose the most poignant way to end the story.Man, now I have to re-watch! It's been a while.Man, I have to watch this movie again.[deleted]This is very eloquently said and similar to how i felt when i first watched the film. Except that i was a teenaged male and had an adult male neighbor who was acting out like lester was. I saw the movie and realized from the start that it couldnt end well for him and he was just acting on childish impulses and fantasies. My neighbor, btw, would smoke pot with me and my buddy (we were 15), sold knives for a living, hated his wife (he married her because she had big tits) and generally just acted like an ass hat. We could see at the age of 15 that he was pathetic and his life would implode. It did.[deleted]So your dad killed him execution style?I still can't help but think, if Angela had fucked some highschool dude before this, she wouldn't have said the virgin thing and nothing would've stopped Lester and I would've just watched a heroes journey where instead of medallions and a kiss from the princess it's underage pussy that's the goal.You are, as it was pointed out, missing the point.  I am Lester's age.  I am the same person I have always been.  I am just as excited, just as adventitious, just has lustful, just as vengeful as I was 40 years ago.  In my mind I am no different now than when I was 20."
"I have tempered it because of responsibility.  I have not lost it, nor sold it to take on a persona of husband or grandpa or elder or boss.  Unlike Lester, I did not lose myself in the process of getting older and doing all those things you do during that time that we call life."
"Lester finds that he lost himself along the way.  What he did up to this point, what we all do, did not bear fruit in terms of happiness.  So Lester goes for a do over."
"From a young persons perspective, it seems creepy.  This old guy lusting after a child.  Smoking weed, dropping out. From Lester's perspective, there is nothing wrong with it.  It is who he is.  It's not forced or made up, its how he feels and he is going after the feels."
"Enter Angela.  To Lester she is something to lust after.  He has disconnected from his roll as an adult, as a guy old enough to be her father, as the father of a daughter who is this girl's age.  He is in do over mode, not creeper mode."
"Life is now exciting for him.  But he realizes when he is about to have sex with her, that his do over is stuff he has already done at some time in his life.  It is not a new experience for him, it is just doing stuff that he has done before and now enjoys doing it again.  There is no do over, there is only do again."
"When he realizes that this would be the first time for Angela, he understands that this would be the thousandth time for him.  He would take from her not just her virginity, but the experience of newness you only get when you are young.  His do over would rob her of this experience.  So he stops because he has learned to temper his impulses with time."
"It is a much deeper movie than it appears.Similar to the ending for American History X."
"Seeing the error in your ways, only to have your past catch up with you.It wasn't his past that killed him in American Beauty. The dad killed him because he couldn't bear someone knowing that he was actually gay."
"In essence he's killed for rebelling against the system that he and everyone else is trapped in to maintain the American dream, where appearance is everything even if they're dying inside. He never did anything to hurt anyone but is still crushed by society for not conforming.I thought the dad killed him not because he didn't want anyone knowing he was gay, but because he couldn't even admit it to himself.   Killing Spacey's character was him trying to kill the gay inside of himself.   The reasoning I always felt why the dad killed him was more a sense of rejection and confusion. Up at the point, the father strongly believes that Spacey's characters is soliciting sex from his son; think back to the scene where it looked like he was being blown in the garage. After the father and son have their fight, it left the father somewhat devastated. At this point I think he approached Spacey more so to see why his son was gay and maybe hopefully understand it by walking in his shoes. After being told he has the wrong idea, the sense of rejection kicked in even more and combined with the confusion led to the possible thought process of what was wrong in his life and family and used Spacey as a scapegoat. I've been a closeted gay person, and my knee-jerk assessment was that he killed Spacey because Spacey rejected him. After all those years of pain and frustration and terrible, terrible loneliness, he finally reached out to someone, finally opened himself to the emotional and sexual connection he so desperately craved--and was denied. He couldn't handle it. Crudely speaking, was a gun-as-phallus kind of thing."
"Also I spent like 5 minutes trying to think of a way to say he couldn't handle it that doesn't sound gay, but he couldn't take it and he couldn't bear it are worsehe bottomed out."
"The universe played a cruel joke and he was the butt.He opened up and got shafted.I don't think the end was tragic, though."
"Throughout the narration he sounds happy.  Which he never seemed to be until the moment before his death.  Even as he's working out, smoking pot, and going hedonistic, I don't think he's truly happy."
"It's in that brief second, when he's hunched over the picture of his family, that you see a genuine smile.  And that split second of pure, genuine happiness is worth it.  I took a message of hope and encouragement form his death.  If one second of enlightenment could bring him so much happiness, could make up for all the crap in his life, even his own murder (he doesn't seem to hold any animosity in the narration), what's stopping me from changing my own life and enjoying however much time I've got left?"
"That's what I took away from the movie.  So basically you feel you should be thankful for every single moment of your stupid little life.Yep! :DWhat I took from that explanation is that you don't have to be thankful for any of it, as long as you're thankful for the last 5 seconds.To be fair, if, in my last five seconds of life, I felt genuine joy at what I had experienced and gratitude for getting to experience it, I think that would be the best outcome I could possibly hope for.> To be fair, if, in my last five seconds of life, I felt genuine joy at what I had experienced and gratitude for getting to experience it, I think that would be the best outcome I could possibly hope for."
"That's how I want to go, not terrified and screaming like my passenger.American Beauty came out when I was in high school and it was my favorite movie for the same reasons you're citing.  Lester was feeling disconnected from everyone and everything with nothing to bring him joy or happiness.  Being desired by his daughter's friend finally made everything snap into place--he doesn't have to hate his wife anymore, he can understand where his daughter is coming from.  He feels freedom and love for the first time in a long time.  It doesn't matter if something terrible happens because he gets it and is happy with what he experienced in his life.  (I also love the setup that his family will be suspects in his murder and will feel the burden of his death despite not giving Lester enough credit while he was alive.  What comes around goes around.)I remember when it came out a gay friend of mine hated it.  I was surprised and he said As soon as I saw that perfect gay couple at the beginning I knew there was going to be some awful homo twist."
"You know what's funny?  I was in high school when this film came out and I related on an almost inverse level."
"If having a midlife crisis by a man can be related to being an averse and disconnected teen girl I was the one to see it. I felt disconnected, discontent and lost. I felt that if I had the love of possibly a wiser older man my life would make sense and is have purpose."
"I experimented with drugs. And just the whole feel of the movie was something I related to."
"It stands as one of my favorite movies for sure. If you've read Joyce's Ulysses you might like [this article](http://nasty.staticred.net/archives/000392.php) I stumbled on a number of years ago.Thank you for this! Very interesting...That's interesting, because 15 years ago I was 35, and I had sympathy for him then, and maybe even more now."
"There's a point in your life - and I realize this is going to come off as creepy and there's no helping it - when you notice that some of your kid's friends are all grown up and are attractive."
"American Beauty stretched it a bit by making it about a dad and a high school cheerleader, but it is a real thing you have to deal with as you get older.  You see that new girl at work and think 'wow, she's cute and then have to remind yourself 'oh, I'm old enough to be her dad.'"
"You're past your sell date.  You're not in your 20s anymore, and if you check out the attractive people around you who aren't past their own sell date, you're a creep.  That level of self-awareness is hard to accept.When I was 15, I was attracted to 18 year olds. When I was 18, was attracted to 18 year olds. When I was 30, I was still attracted to 18 year olds, but it was suddenly no longer ok. I am very much looking forward to dirty old man status, when I no longer have to hide the fact that I am still attracted to 18 year olds, and will always be attracted to 18 year olds.I get older, they stay the same age.ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIIGHT!![deleted]I am 52 now, and I tell my wife that I now see how easy it is to become the dirty old man. When I was 20, there was a certain type of woman (smart, tall, blonde, etc.) that I was attracted to. It was the same when I was 25, 35, 45. I doubt that it will be much different when I am 75. It just really sucks because I still appreciate the exact same thing, but since I have been appreciating the same thing for 35 years, suddenly there is something wrong with me?Yeah I'm at an age where I have to remind myself that women see me in a role like job title or co worker and am otherwise invisible."
"On the plus side, it does allow for a greater sense of honesty with them. Not being harsh but truthful. Like Paul Newman said in Color of Money I'm not your daddy and I'm not your boyfriend so knock it off.Shit, man, now you got me worried. Sometimes I notice my dad looking at women on the street and think to myself: Am I *still* gonna be doing that when I turn 50?> Am I still gonna be doing that when I turn 50?"
"unless you are deadThere's nothing wrong with noticing a beautiful human being. There is something wrong with trying to fuck your 16 year old daughter's hot friends."
"Yes.  Yes you will.  Women don't all of a sudden stop being attractive when you turn a certain age.  Your dad is a human.  You are too.  Just accept it50 isn't geriatric.  50 year olds still get turned on, fuck, etc.  I'd be more concerned if you're NOT looking at attractive women when you're 50.Seriously! A lot of men and women look pretty damn amazing even in their 50s! Especially if they have good genes and have lived a healthy life to that point. I've definitely seen women in their 50s who I wouldn't necessarily pass on, and I'm still in my mid 20s. But I am kind of a pervert so I may be in the minority. I agree."
"I think the 50s are a sweet spot."
"Still in good enough shape to have aerobic sex. The experience and practiced skill to back it up. You are past pregnancy scares. You stop caring so much about what everyone else thinks. You are past hang ups. What is not to love?>  But I am kind of a pervert."
"Username checks outThere isn't anything much more creepy than one of your dad's friends complimenting you on how well you're growing up and filling out.Huh? How does checking out attracting, way younger than you, people around you make you a creep? It's how you look and what you do that would make you a creep. It's just normal to admire good looks and even lust after them. Normal, not creepy. If you start stalking them, flirting with them, staring them like a motherfucker, sure then it's creepy. But just checking out attractive people? Normal."
"I don't get Reddits creepy standards right now, at all, since this is getting over 200 votes for that creeping. The fuck. Reddit is all in their early 20s. Anyone over 25 having any kind of sexual urges whatsoever is creepy to them.Its just a bunch of 18-20 year Olds throwing out generalizations, reddit in 20 years will describe these situations differently.I think a lot of people stare like a motherfucker without realizing it when they're checking someone out. That has a lot to do with the creep label."
"Then there are a bunch of other people who stare like a motherfucker on purpose because they get off on making a girl feel uncomfortable (same people who catcall). Yes, there are those bastards who just stare at every woman in a mall as though they just walked into The Grotto at Hefner's Mansion. 20 year old and 60 year olds.>if you check out the attractive people around you who aren't past their own sell date, you're a creep."
"Or, you know, a normal human being.An older man can be very attractive. Even more than 2x older. Creepy actions are creepy regardless of age.Until it's the father of your daughter's friend. Maybe just me, but if you're 50 and happen to notice a good looking 22 year old, ain't nothing wrong with that. They're in the prime of their life. Its normal.To notice is fine, it's normal to notice attractiveness at any age. The key is to be self-aware enough to not stare or attempt to engage. That's creepy and inappropriate.There's some truth to that."
"But I'm reminded of the First rule: Be attractive thing.  Think how it feels to the 22 year old.  You're creepy as fuck."
"The difference between creepy and adorable?  How receptive the person is to the activity.Also, not for nothing, but it is increasingly more difficult to tell a 22 year old from a 17 year old. Watch how they act. Same is true of young men. People who are like 17-18 tend to be constantly adjusting themselves and their outputs, watching other people and all that. People who are like 19-22 act confident and usually direct themselves only at what has their attention. Yuppies that are like 22-28 are the same but dress better. After that they just stop giving a shit. Eh.  I work at a university and I can usually tell the Freshmen from the seniors.  But I might be observing a lot of social cues (confidence, etc) that you wouldn't necessarily see in a different context.It is so much harder at university where 18-22 year olds are all functionally identical. I once mistook an Irish girl in her first year like me for an 18 year old, she was 25 and had travelled all around south american and done a ton of stuff and decided to get a degree. Still crazy to get my head around that now.Because a lot of the difference is social cues that you aren't in tune with anymore. Girls are fully mature physically at 15 or so and some can pass for mature at 13. But they don't act mature and they don't dress or wear their hair the same as a 22 year old."
"As a father to an 18 year old girl  I've been exposed to a lot of teenage girls and it has made me recalibrate my age radar. I really thought I was a serious creep for a while as I started to notice my daughter's friends. Now that she is in college I was happy to discover that college girls look better still.Actually, most women haven't finished fully developing physically until around 20 years old.  The top might be done at 15, but the hips and butt and thighs still have a bit to go.  That's why a girl probably changes jeans sizes at least once between 15 and 20, even if she doesn't weigh any more, and why it's a huge deal for an older woman to lose enough weight to wear her high school jeans again. Even 15."
"There is absolutely nothing wrong, amoral or unethical in finding another person who has started puberty with noticeable secondary sex characters, sexually attractive. That is normal, even if you're their dad's age."
"To act on it is a different matter all together and cultures obviously view the issue differently in regards to of age/age gaps between partners for sex/romance/procreation. Has always been like that."
"It's also often difficult to tell 15 year olds from 20 year olds."
"When I was 19, my sister was 13. She would bring girls home that looked like my age... nice boobs, nice ass, beautifully developed. They were 13-14 themselves. Girls that age want to look older, girls at the age of 20 already want to look younger. They meet in the middle.> nice boobs, nice ass, beautifully developed."
"I spotted the creep.You just slowly talked yourself into pervin on 13 year olds..And I don't mindYeah, sorry, I am not ashamed of what I thought back then. Hell, I wouldn't be ashamed of it now. My sister still brings hot friends home now, but they are her age, so they are all legal now. Hooray!"
"Don't really see your point. Hot girls are hot girls. You can lie to yourself all you want, doesn't make them any less objectively hot.[deleted]I'm in the same situation you were age-wise and quite frankly your reasoning is fucking disgusting. The fact that you're aware of their age is what should immediately turn you off instead of they're still hot though. Honestly, why are you even trying to justify any of this? Why even admit, let alone reason, to the fact that you were sexualizing 13 year olds at 19?"
"This fucking thread. Because they were 13 and you were 19. Being attracted to one 13 year old out of a dozen and never mentioning it because it's creepy as hell is one thing. Feeling totally comfortable in admitting that you find dozens of 13 year olds attractive...you're a creep, dude.There is nothing creepy about that."
"I actually find it rather creepy that you are brainwashed enough to believe that's creepy. If you don't find a girl that underwent puberty and looks like an adult physically attractive, it means that there is something biologically wrong with you."
"Most likely psychologically damaged due to being taught that finding people attractive wrong and having a massive problem with your sexuality and controlling your own urges. You should talk to a therapist about that.You're projecting a lot. Please don't act on your urges and if you can, attempt to stop ogling 13 year olds. You need help.[There's ok, there's creepy, there's wrong, then there's you](https://i.imgur.com/caMm6N8.jpg)Agree. Some girls are fully developed physically around 13-14 and there's no difference between them and a 20 yr old except the mental maturity. Laws don't affect biology.Every generation has said that. I've been hearing it for over 40 years. Yeah, but now it's different because it's me. Also, when did music turn to a bunch of shitty noise? I'm trying to figure out how I'm going hard of hearing, yet annoyed by all the loud music an television shows simultaneously.because the music is louder than the dialogue. i know you were just being funny, but i swear they make the music way louder than the talking.I'm 30 (gee, someone referred to that as past your sell by date) so obviously a little different than 22 but I am consistently attracted to 60 year olds.  Even when I was 22 I was attracted to men at least 20 years older.  Being a girl is weird.Totally not past it. Age is such a subjective thing anyway."
"I'm 47 and have been hit on by a 16 year old, and a 65 year old in teh last year."
"Nothing wrong with being attracted to, or by, anyone, ever (legal age in your country, folks)."
"It's when it stops that will be the hard thing to deal with...You're telling me. I'm a 40 year old woman, married to a 26 year old man. I sure never thought that would happen when I was younger.I'm 36 and my S.O. Is 22. There is a stigma to the age difference, but that passed for me after a few months of dating. We're very happy and that's what matters>there is a sigma to the age difference"
"Just because your age gap is two standard deviations away from the mean doesn't mean you're a deviant.This quote reminds me of my days back in college when my friends used to argue about the order of operations for the half your age plus seven ruleI know a LOT of May-December relationships (I'm an attorney - occupational hazard).  When they work, they work extremely well.  While out of the mainstream, there is nothing inherently strange or creepy about such relationships.  Unfortunately, society tends to be judgmental."
"You are not creepy for merely looking. Looking is a natural part of our genders' interaction and if you are cool (notice I did NOT say attractive) it can be a charming part of anyone's day. A smile and a nod is ok."
"What is *not* cool is fixedly staring in a manner that makes obvious you are having intimate thoughts about the person. That's rude. So is having your hands linger when you say hello or goodbye, etc.I think you're putting too much of the responsibility for your actions on the receiving party. The difference between adorable and creepy is *being able to judge* how receptive the other person is. I'm a gay man, soon to be 52. In the last couple of years I have been attracting much younger men. I'm not in shape, I have nothing physically attractive to offer. Still, there are 4 young bucks who wanna cuddle and play with a Daddy type. None of them want my money. It didn't bother me until the 21 year old mentioned his father's age  -- and yes, I'm older than his dad."
"Almost everybody fetishizes something, and almost nobody wants to be desired simply for being someone else's fetish. Straight man near the same age here. It's a confidence thing. When you reach our age, you tend to be secure and comfortable and that shows. It's an attractive quality. Now the key is, don't let that confidence deteriorate into don't give a shit where you start going out in public wearing pajamas. That ain't pretty. [deleted]> But I'm reminded of the First rule: Be attractive thing. Think how it feels to the 22 year old. You're creepy as fuck."
">"
"Sure. Which is why you're concerned with how you approach people. You don't want to be running up on 22 year olds, especially not in a work environment."
"Feeling some shame in your head for noticing though? I dunno, let's leave the guilt for the Catholics. It's like not being able to look at masterpiece paintings just because I can't afford one.  Why should I have to cut myself off from admiring some of the beauty in an otherwise ugly world."
"However, there's a big difference between merely looking, and leering... and there's no way in Hell I'm going to put on my leisure suit and toupee and try the hey baby, ever made it with an old guy? shtick.It's like the sun, you glance, appreciate, and look away.AmenMay peace be with you.And also with you.>And with your spirit."
"FTFYAnd let's use and also with you for 2000 years, and then CHANGE IT.   To trick John.[Hallelujah!](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PDnW5XxjwI8/hqdefault.jpg)I was thinking about that the other day. When you are young, you don't notice a lot of beauty. When you get older, you see youth and health as beauty."
"When you're young, you're surrounded by it, so you take it for granted.I kinda noticed that when moving from Italy to Britain and then back again. Coming back to Italy I suddenly noticed that the standards of beauty were much higher. Which sucks for an ugly-ass nerd like me.where in italy?  do you like italy better than britain?Parma. Well, it's my hometown, so I like it a lot, but in objective terms it's not that different from York, where I was.Really? Thats interesting. So people in italy are just generally more attractive? I think it's mostly that they care way more.shouldn't it also kinda work in your favour if you actually lowered your own standards a bit(which i have to assume you did if you only noticed it when you came back)?They were never that high to start with :)"
"After all, I was always an ugly nerd.Britain is Britain. Their chicks are the worst in Europe. Not just ugly but usually stupid and see nothing else but partying. And before anybody says I'm stupid or something -  I'm living in a god damn Britain right now.I have always found it weird that American women love British men, but American men don't feel the same about British women. I frankly think most British people are ugly as fuck, but women love those accents.I don't know why you got down voted, its so true"
"Source: fellow Brit.Because this:"
"> Not just ugly but usually stupid and see nothing else but partying"
"Is one of the most spectacularly retarded lines its possible to come out with.So many British complain about Eastern European immigrants, but Britain could really use some Slavic genetics to diversify their gene pool. Seriously Slavic girls on average look so much better than the British. Thats what living on an island does.The  Vikings took all the hot ones away and kept them for themselves. Explains why Scandinavian women are so good looking.The vikings settled in England and intermarried. [Look](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/England_878.svg)Source?Skyrim nude mods.Christ man, find a different city then? There's fairly attractive British girls out there.The attractive ones are about as attractive everywhere, it's just that the average is lower.On top of that, people dress better and are more fashion conscious. It's not weird for men to wear bright, colorful clothing while wearing a scarf and oversized sunglasses."
"They're definitely more fashion conscious, but if anything the colours are more pared down in my area of Italy.Ok, I get it. I have bad teeth.When I was in high school, one of my older teachers said during a lecture All of you look beautiful to me. I thought it was weird at the time, now I understand it.I've entered my mid 40's.  I work at a university.   Everyday I'm reminded of the fact that I'm old enough to be the girl in the yoga pants that I'm gawking at father.   Everyday.  More importantly, the other day I was sending a fax for a girl when I saw her birthdate and realized that....shit, I've got a pair of pants older than her.It's even better when they talk about studying events in history class that you watched on the evening news as an adult."
"I can remember thinking the JFK or MLK assassinations were ancient history when I was a kid and both of those events were more recent than Desert Storm or the LA riots are to today.1990 seems so closer to today than 1965 was in 1990.You knock that shit off right now FUCKYeah, I teach at a university and see young women in their physical prime day in and day out. When I run into old friends from high school and they ask me what I do, most of them say stuff like, Man,  I bet you love seeing all those girls! How have you not been fired yet? Man, how are you still married? But what they fail to realize is what Spacey's character comes to understand at the end of American Beauty: an attractive, sexually mature child is still just a child."
"At a distance, it's easy for middle aged men like myself to idealize these young women into seductive temptresses. Especially if you're one of these guys who think you haven't changed much since you were a teen. But, for most of these guys, it's probably been quite some time since they had a conversation with an actual 17 year old. Honestly, all it takes is talking to one for a few minutes to wake up from these kinds of fantasies."
"Yet, I still catch myself looking from time to time.Maybe true for you, but I'm 44 and I can still Tweet some pretty boss Instagrams, just like the kids. Well said. It's amazing how much maturity lags behind sexuality. If that makes any sense. It's primarily because we continue to mature as we age in a way most people didn't centuries ago because we are more educated and live longer. A 40yo peasant wasn't all that more mature than a 15yo peasant in 1400 AD.Wow. Great point."
"Everything all of the time."
"The best evidence I can give to your point is that I lived into my teenage years before I had access to the Internet yet now I can't for life of me remember what life was like before it."
"Which I admit is a bit disconcerting."
"So it goes. So it goes.>  an attractive, sexually mature child is still just a child"
"I could not possibly agree more.   I don't teach, but I do interact with them on a daily basis.  I'm stuck by the fact that they, while absolutely beautiful in many cases, are empty shells.  No experiences, no experience, no nothing.  Not substantially different intellectually from my 13 year old.    They are children with debt, thats it.  Empty shells ready to be filled with life experiences, not my penis."
"There is a girl that works at the little grocery store down the street from me.  Maybe 25.  Beautiful, not unlike the girls slightly younger than her at the college she probably longed to go to.  Life dealt her a shitty hand.  She's made mistakes, kids, has been hurt, alone and scared, struggles to get by everyday.  She is much more interesting than the yoga pants squad, and much more attractive to me....also very off limits.I find that young women (actually young people in general) seem to have a very rigid world view that has been *unaltered* by experience. Honestly, I avoid interacting with them except when necessary.I've had the same experience with people close to my age, and I'm in my 20s.How is she off limits?My wife owes a gun and is slightly unhinged.Ah. So you're the off limits one..."
"Edit: a wordNo, she is.  My wife will shoot me, not her.Edit: Fuck it. I have no idea where I was going with that comment. Back to your regularly scheduled programming. Empty shells is a bit harsh. My 40 year old friends pill addicted wife is an empty shell. These young women are just immature.  I'm 32 and a few years ago I realized that there is a generational gap between me and people in their early 20s.  It was startling. And I feel like that is the big change. I can recognize immaturity pretty quickly in young people.  My 17 year old baby sitter is no different to me than my neighbors 12 year old. They are both children."
"I'm not disparaging  young people. I was in my early 20s at one point and made a lot of decisions that looking back were rash and poor.  I'm just saying you definitely detect a difference as you leave your 20s..."
"I've seen the question asked on here when did you know you were a grown up... many answers will be something  like when I realized I could do whatever I want. No adult will give that answer.>reddit, when did you realize you were an adult?"
">when I ate ice cream for breakfast"
"That's not being an adult. That's being a kid that doesn't have their mom telling them no.Maturity kind of *is* about being able to do whatever you want, but it's more about continuing to do what you decided to do, even when there are pain factors influencing you not to do that, telling you to take the easier road."
"It's being a man or woman of your word and being able to make and keep promises, even if they're unspoken promises, even if they were promises to yourself in your own mind and no one else will punish you for failing or reward you for succeeding.  And when you sometimes fail to keep the promise, welcoming the consequences and dealing with them."
"To illustrate my point, some flashes of maturity in my life."
"* The first time I had an opportunity to lie to 100% guaranteed avoid some negative consequences and I decided the cost to my own personal integrity was too high.  The other party would never know if I lied, but I'd rather take the consequences and tell the truth anyway."
"* The first time I didn't feel like working on a personal project I'd committed to and would experience no repercussions from quitting, yet made myself do it anyway.  No external motivation whatsoever, no one would ever see it, no one would call me out for quitting.  And this was after starting and losing interest in dozens of projects over the previous years."
"* The day I noticed I was enjoying the actual act of working out, rather than grinding for the results."
"My parents were 40ish when I was born, and my siblings were all quite a bit older than me. As a result I tend to interact better with people older than I am. I even have a little difficulty with people my own age. Forget talking to people in their 20s. I just don't get them.There are certainly exceptions. And again, i really don't mean to disparage young people. Its not like approaching middle age is so rad. I think he meant they are empty shells yet to achieve some level of fulfillment, whereas your friends wife is an empty shell of the person she once was.Doesn't matter if you're just looking for sex and not a conversation.My husband teaches at a university as well. I used to get a little jealous, until he explained that most of his students have the personalities of kumquats and as soon as they open their mouths, any potential attraction disappears.That's true, however not all of the students are like that, i also teach at a university and although most of them are immature kids there are also some attractive and interesting women. Sorry about that.I agree.  It's fun to look, but honestly, talking to anyone below 25 tends to be teeth-grinding.  You can find rare exceptions of advanced maturity at 22-24, but seriously, no one knows who they are before 25."
"Hell, I'm 39, and I don't know who the hell I am.  I'm 32 and I have no idea who you are also. Or be George Clooney.Don't have to be Clooney if you have money. Unfortunately I have neither.Or Hugh Hefner."
"Dude is older than my mom, but my daughter is older than any of his girlfriends.Hugh Hefner is a huge creep. Those girlfriends of his pretty much have to sleep with him in order to get the good shoots and publicity. There's plenty of stories out there detailing how sleeping with Hefner is the only way to really succeed for Playboy models.They all knew what they were signing up for from the beginning.  He was a cad since the 60s. It's just that now society has changed what he's doing is frowned upon."
"Plus playboys over anyway.  They're getting rid of porn in their magazines and just having articles.  Yes some of the articles are interesting but you're basically speeding up the destruction of your empire.  Destroy the core readers at your peril When my dad got it I would read it from cover to cover. I found it very informative with good fiction and great interviews. My biggest regret after he died was not going through them and saving the issue with the Jimmy Carter interview.They're trying to become a men's lifestyle magazine but with none of the clout of GQ and all of the stigma of Hustler.In my opinion that doesn't just make Hef the creep. It also makes the women who stoop low enough to do that pretty despicable as well.I tend to judge the multimillionaire employer who creates an environment where there is an implicit pressure to sleep with him if they want to advance at a notable player in their field more harshly than his employees who are then under pressure to sleep with him."
"This women knew what they were getting into. Holding Hef anymore responsible is bullshit.You're right, those silicone injected rocket scientists are all saints who were ripped out of volunteering at soup kitchens to be victimized by big, bad Hef.Because that's what I said.You said you judge Hef more harshly than the parade of bimbos knocking on his door with legs wide open just so they have a better chance to appear in a worldwide magazine with, again, legs wide open."
"Yea, Hef is the real monster here.Jesus, calm down with this sex shame shit.You've got some misogynistic issues to work through my friend. However, if growing as a person scares you or sounds like too much work, I hear there are many subreddits available where hating women is encouraged. This isn't one of them. ^found the rapist.They are dropping the nude photos in the magazine, the same as they have done on their website. [Link](http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/playboy-magazine-to-drop-nude-pictures-20151310)Why are you using all this sexist, judgemental language? How do you know they aren't intelligent? Because they're attractive? What's wrong with a woman displaying her own body and using that to make large amounts of money?"
"You keep insulting these women like they're doing something wrong. Have you any insight into the kind of lives they lead? You're coming across as so weird and misogynistic.Lol someone set this guy's interalized hatred of women offWhat I find utterly hilarious is that Hollywood does this implicitly all the time and no one remotely gives a shit,  but because it's the heff in a sex industry no less,  he's getting attacked."
"If you think jlaw got her first big break out roll on the strength of her acting and not a handjob for the director you really don't understand how fucking your way to the top works."
"> and no one remotely gives a shit,"
"Well...depends on who you talk to. Didn't Ashley Judd just come out and get a lot of support for sharing her story. Not fixed=/= no one gives a shit."
"And, I can't speak for other people. I am me. I give a shit. So take up the hypocrisy with those people."
"Besides, Hef has managed to go through life quite fine all things considered. He got on shows like Entourage, with his home being seen as a grown-up Neverland,and no one called him out on shit."
"So it's not like he's being hunted by people with pitchforks"
"Astley judd coming out and talking about it is a bid to revitalise a career that has been dried up. The moment I see the current top male and female actors talk about how they've been forced to fuck a boss or gay for pay to get a role is the moment I see some progression on this issue. Course they'd all get blacklisted which is why they don't do it"
"You know shit goes. My friend is trying to act in LA. The number of times he's called me crying because he can't or won't have sex for a bit part is too damn high. See this is exactly what I'm talking about.  Hollywood pretends to be super liberal and progressive but most of the people in power absolutely abuse their authority,  are sexist,  racist,  vulgar,  and do all the things that liberals and anyone with a sense of humanity normally would rally against."
"It's such a big farce and an open secret.  Same thing happens in bollywood too but more political connects and mafiaNo one's forcing any of the models to work there. It's completely voluntary and it's not like a minimum wage job where you have no other options. They're there because they want to be.Really though, is Playboy even relevant anymore? I literally can't name a playboy model that wasn't a celebrity first, and then a playboy model as their career waned (i.e. Tia Carrere or Lindsey Lohan) ."
"Compare this to the handful of pornstars I can name like Stoya, Sasha Gray, Cytheria, or Liz Vicious, who are all women from the video and online video era."
"Does succeeding in playboy really do anything for your career these days?Playboy is now so irrelevant that the print edition is no longer going to feature naked women. It really will be about the articles now."
"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/13/business/media/nudes-are-old-news-at-playboy.html"
">As part of a redesign that will be unveiled next March, the print edition of Playboy will still feature women in provocative poses. But they will no longer be fully nude.They are probably trying to get out of the back section of news stands, because nobody sees them there."
"If they get to the front, its actually likely people will read it."
"They could become a magazine with GQ articles and Maxim pictures.So they're going to do what Maxim did 20 years ago?  I guess they could be a more upscale version of it given their better articles and able to get good interviews.Under pressure is not the same as 'forced'.In any industry other than one where you are explicitly selling your sexuality I would be more inclined to agree with you about this particular instance. Sleeping with Hefner is the only way to really succeed for Playboy models sounds a lot like Running the register is the only way to really succeed for cashiers.The *idea* of Hefner (as someone I knew little about but saw on TV every once in a while) was cool to me when I was 15, as I grew up it just hit me at some point that, wow, this guy is kind of a creep man."
"Then the stories from his recent batch of models came out and he wasn't just creepy, but kinda sad tbh, something that I would have laughed at if I heard anyone say it when I was younger.At this point it's rather like taking an action figure of the Crypt Keeper and sticking it with 3 Barbie dolls.You guys are so mean. I can just imagine Hugh crying while reading this thread."
"And then wiping his tears on a 19yo muff.Well, at least it probably isn't very hard.Unfortunately for the girlfriends, Viagra exists. Get out of here Dewey! You don't want any of this!Huge difference between Clooney and Hefner. Clooney can still pull almost the same amount of women just being a manager at K Mart. If you take away Hefners fame and money he wouldn't have been able to get laid since the 70sI'm not sure that's fair to old Hugh. Sure, he looks like a bag of bones now, but he was always a very handsome man. Maybe not *Clooney* handsome but who is?I highly doubt that. Clooney is attractive, but like most famous people, put them in a normal background without fame and millions of women would lose interest. That's the emptiness of the human mind. I don't know, dude has legitimate magnetic charisma. Like, I've never found him attractive (I can tell he's attractive but he's not attractive to me) yet when I met him I couldn't take my eyes off of him, couldn't stop grinning and could barely form coherent sentences. He just pulls you in and doesn't let go. The world is lucky he didn't choose to be a cult leader. Assuming he maintained that in his new life as a KMart manager he'd still do preeeeetty well. However cool you are with fame, he was still George Clooney. If you had the same reaction to some unknown dude that would be something special. Not saying Clooney doesn't have something but it is inextricably wrapped up with his 500 watt star power nowIf he was a Kmart manager in his other life, he probably wouldn't be as charismatic due to not being a mega famous actor. Being one of the most famous people of an entire generation, having a boat load of money, and being able to walk down the street where women would swarm you for pictures would make any man unbelievably confident. if he was naturally charismatic he probably wouldn't have been a k mart manager."
"also, a charismatic k mart manager could pull tons of younger girls in a small town.  he'd have a lot more power/money/authority than the rest of the guys the younger girls would be dating."
"small towns are weird and the standards are WAY lower. There was a plot point in a book I read a while back explaining how attractive people in small towns can actually be the ones least likely to leave because they tend to be sexually active at an age, and in an environment, that isn't conducive to preventing unplanned pregnancies. Therefore they get stuck before they get a chance to use the power of sexiness to move up in the world."
"I don't know if that's true, statistically speaking, but, from what I've seen in different small towns I've lived in, there might be some truth in it. Santa Clause wants some lovin'.First time seeing that special referenced. Excited for the tipping point when it starts popping up everywhere."
"E: special is A Very Murray Christmas on netflix.I liked it.  It was weird, but sincere.Definitely worth watching on a lazy Sunday evening.That's exactly what I did!  Drank some tea and chilled out with it.The late 90's had a different angst as well. Pre-9/11 angst.That's a really interesting concept.  What do you think the primary angst for each generation has been?My thoughts, for what they're worth. The later '90s were drenched in anxiety over office culture. Movies like The Matrix, Office Space, Clockwatchers, American Beauty, and Fight Club carried a lot of suspicion for middle managers, the drudgery of work, and especially the soul-suckery of the cubicle - The Matrix makes that a visual punchline when Neo wakes up in the real world and is still getting drained in a small room in a high-rise."
"The '50s fears over Russia equating to irradiated monster pictures (=the nuclear threat) and body snatcher movies (=the communist threat), or how so many war films of the late '70s and early '80s key off the disillusionment and moral quagmires of Vietnam (Coppola, Cimino, Stone)."
"The superhero genre since 9/11 has the weird habit of invoking and sometimes luxuriating in the destruction of New York and New York City analogues (Gotham, Metropolis), often playing off iconic images (the wall of flyers, someone stuck in the rubble, etc.)  And films like Nolan's *Batman* trilogy and the *Iron Man* films interestingly suggest collusion between insurgent terrorists and American capitalist interests. Which all suggest broad fear of further terrorism and an American infrastructure that enables it. Hail Hydra.You forgot to talk about the music, too. Radiohead practically invented self-loathing hatred of everyday drudgery. And I loved them for it. The past few years have had a LOT of apocalyptic movies. The whole zombie genre suddenly became huge. This may indicate how this generation feels part of a huge system they can't do anything about, and capitalizes on a fantasy of societal breakdown, chaos and libertarianism. (The Purge, World War Z, Contagion,  The Walking Dead) The 2009 financial crisis, global warming, terrorism, oil wars, all huge global problems that make us seem insignificant, and unable to deal with individually. It seems like we're all craving to have more control over our lives, and feel significant. you use words goodIt took me a long time to work this out for myself, when I was trying to understand why 1999 was such a revolutionary explosion in cinema trickling into the early 2000's, where it vaporized."
"Five of the six films you mentioned for this period were of The Year That Changed Film and... perhaps my ideals are simply out of fashion for legitimate reason, but I believe they failed to change film as everyone thought they would because of the disappointing internal shift in American people, post-9/11."
"It's too dangerous out there. We need to put our trust in authority."
"The same mindset is then applied to corporate culture when the economic crash delivers a foul taste of forced independence, and that affects the way our children are raised."
"What people want now is to survive, and who survives better than Frank Underwood? That is where our Lester Burnham has gone."
"Hopefully our look back at failed economies and failed wars will at least sustain the current trend of questioning authority again. It doesn't criticize the system as much as it should, preferring to paint targets on specific significant power players. but I suppose that's better than nothing."
"Totally agree. Plus our media now doesn't tend to wallow in the middle class disaffectedness that characterized films like American Beauty and Fight Club. Both in the post 9/11 and post-2008 Financial Crisis western world, the idea of a comfortable middle class life being boring or stifling is generally lower on our list of existential anxieties. Films in 1999 explored facets of masculinity a whole lot. Magnolia was another film from that year and I thought it was as compelling as American Beauty and Fight Club, but no one seems to remember it alongside the others. (I really loved Philip Seymour Hoffmann as a hospice nurse, too) That's a really interesting take. Looking back on the movies of my formative years the horror and drudgery of office culture was actually pretty huge. I wonder if that has played into my own determination not to be stuck in a 'cube'. Good news! Companies have been getting rid of cubes and moving to open workspaces.  So now you just get no privacy at all and the company saves money not having to buy walls!> The Matrix makes that a visual punchline when Neo wakes up in the real world and is still getting drained in a small room in a high-rise"
"Damn. Never thought of that. And I've watched it like 10 times."
"The visual punchline. Nice way of putting it.Also. Cypher later points out that they're no more free in the real world than the virtual one. They live in shitty conditions, eating shitty food, doing what they're told for a livingWell, that's a fun comment to read. Nice thoughts."
"Edit: Not sarcasm.I was a sixteen year old girl when I first saw American Beauty, and even then I had empathy for Spacey, but most of all for Mena Suvari's character, who I was very much like at that point in my life. Not because I was a hot cheerleader--as far as social skills went I was much more on the Thora Birch end of things--but because I was insecure and exploring a sexuality that felt forbidden to me at that point in my life. I still empathize with her when I watch that movie now, and Spacey, and even Bening's character to an extent. It's a really fantastic film, one of my absolute favorites, and I feel like I'm going to continue to age through it.I know right? When I first saw Silence of the Lambs, Buffalo Bill was a total creep, but today, I'd fuck me, I'd fuck me hardIn the 70s and 80s, protagonists in movies wanted to escape the local factory/mine and do something great."
"In the 90s, they wanted to escape the office."
"I think that these days most people are happy with any kind of work, so these tropes are less popular."
"I am a 45-year-old man with an office job, and, like Lester (and Peter Gibbons), I long to escape the drudgery.  I imagine a lot of men feel that way.  > I think that these days most people are happy with any kind of work"
"I will have to disagree strongly. I've only worked like about 2 years, and I hated most of it. Even though my work involves doing something I like. Work is fuckin work. When you do what you like, but for others, all the fun is sucked out and it's just damn work."
"I always think of carefully formulating a business plan or a startup idea on the weekends, but instead end up not doing it. I want to escape it, but I also fear what I'm escaping to get to."
"The comfort of a stable job is too cozy to get out of.[deleted]That's a good point, but I'd argue there's a difference between being happy with something and merely being accepting of it. Most people aren't happy being in a cubicle job, but are accepting of it because of the stability like you mentioned. If they had a better option, they'd probably leave, but that usually requires large personal risk like taking out loans for some kind of additional education, starting a business, or moving. So, they remain in the cubicle, unhappy but with food on the table, a roof, and a car. And that's the difference. In 1999 a movie like Office Space might have jolted you out of it, and you might have been financially secure enough to take those risks. People were doing it daily, every week seem to produce a new dotcom millionaire."
"Now, no one feels secure enough to do anything like that. Watching something like Office Space doesn't get your creative thoughts about freedom going, it just makes you fucking hate your life.It's still one of the few films that makes my workplace frustrations feel normalIts gotta be something primal, we should be out kill/eating bears, and burning down the next tribe over.  Not whatever this is now a days.I'm a graduate student in a chemistry program, and just about every day I think about how I should just abandon civilization and live in the woods and make drugs and alcohol. I'll become the crazy guy in the woods that knows way too much about chemistry. But the Internet. ...Whatever this is...."
"I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks this way. You've inspired me. I'm gonna attack the next row of cubes and add them to my tribe.Just check with HR first.They laugh when you say that. They have absorbed so many conquerors into their culture it isn't even funny.I have been assimilated. Resistance is.....feudal.You slipped that pun in like a ninjaI don't thnk it's killing eating bears, but rather feeling a real connection with our families and communities.  We spend sooo much time at work, at school, at organized activities the kids do, we only get a few hectic hours at home with spouse and kids, let alone friends."
"We feel completely disconnected and that makes those hours at work feel unreal and empty.  Whereas in our youth, we felt connections in school and to our parents.  We got older, imagined we'd feel those same connections from the opposite direction, but then it fails, because it's harder as an adult.  You need more time.And look at what people are willing to do for that sense of real connection - what you're describing isn't just office workers, it's basically the background of every western jihadist willing to do anything to feel meaningful and important and part of something. I mean, isn't that what lead the people in Fight Club to turn to terrorism? They just wanted *something*."
"When we feel disconnected and empty, we search desperately for something, anything, to fill that hole. If we can't find a connection, maybe we will settle for burning down the next tribe over.This feeling of disconnection definitely characterized the workplace vibe in the 1990s. It left a painful mark. Once I had a family and started to manage larger teams of people, the #1 thing I did, and insisted that the managers on my team did, was to completely destroy that emptiness. We didn't do it with drinking after work or forced socialization. We did it by simply engaging with people as *people* not jobs and treating them like most people want to be treated anywhere: dignity, respect, feeling good about their efforts, opportunity to shine. Above all else: honesty and vulnerability on the part of managers. ^ This. Humans have spent the overwhelming portion of our evolution as tribal beings. We are now stripped of that.  Certain social changes have made this even worse in the past two decades."
"Wow dude, hammer and nail head.I've always had a theory it's because we leave the office without making/creating any tangible.Like what have I actually achieved this week other than having words on a computer screen. My bf is an architect and very satisfied, I think because he comes out of a project with a tangible result he can see."
"It's also why I think a lot of old school hobbies are coming back - knitting, sewing, wood working etc. You get to see/touch what your hard work created, which is what is missing from modern work lifeRequiem For a Dream was this movie for me."
"2003 (just outta HS): damn.....drugs are fucked up"
"2014: damn....I need to see my parents more oftenI'm just impressed you watched it a second time. I can't do it.[deleted]I first watched that film when I was 16, and I remember really liking Kevin Spacey's character. He was a bit of a weirdo at times, but overall, I found him well-meaning and amusing. It's his wife that I hated, and I still do, as of my most recent viewing."
"Similarly, I also liked and felt empathy for Joaquin Phoenix's character in *Her*, while a lot of my peers refused to watch the movie due to its apparently stupid concept."
"They're missing out on a great film.I am with you on this, spacey is a good guy in this film for me, he has just made many life choices that have culmulatively changed his life into something other than he had imagined. He simple wakes up one day to discover that he is living someone elses life."
"His wife though....."
"This might just mean we are both creeps.I always took it as Lester realizing he wasn't the king of his castle and wanting to take control again. The climax where he rejects the girl and comforts her with the tea is the end of his quest to regain control. He found what he wanted, and made a decision about it which had been his whole struggle. His decision was pure and he was alone in making it. He was tricked into lusting over this girl because he wasn't in control of his life. At the end she allows him to make the decision on his own by offering him what he thought he wanted. He realizes he wanted this young girl because there was a vacuum in his life causing him unhappiness."
"His wife just never had that revelation."
"This is one of my favorite movies because the decisions everyone makes are completely understandable and relatable. Everyone is dissatisfied with the way external influences are trying to direct their lives andost fully succumb to those pressures. Lester Burnham is a truly unique and admirable hero because he carves his own niche in a very seemingly misdirected way and still comes out on top. He dies happy because his job is done, which is the ultimate end for a hero.I think his wife did have that revelation. It just hit too late. Her falling sobbing into his clothes is that moment. She thought she wanted to be rid of him, but when she finally was she understood how much she had just lost. She was on the same journey he was on, just in a different way.I don't end up hating any of the characters and that's what makes the film so brilliant. Nobody is truly the antagonist and everyone has believable and often tragic motivations for why they act the way they do. Lester's wife realizes (too late) how much she truly does love her husband after she finds him dead, as she clutches his clothes and breaks down crying (and now I'm crying too). God I love that movie. I watch it at least once a year.I think there are a lot of people who just have difficulty grasping the concept of an AI so lifelike that you could form that strong an attachment to it.  You're right, it's a great movie.i think its more that some people just cant empathize properly.  you can watch a documentry on hitler and understand how he did what he did without condoning it.  you can watch a film and understand its characters choices and actions without going ye im gonna fuck my desktopWell I obviously took the wrong message from her I've been hitting on my desktop for months. Why, yes, Clippy, it does look like I'm writing another love letter...I had the opposite reaction actually."
"First saw it when I was 18, and I was still very much in a high school mindset, where I thought that I was a mature adult. So I viewed 16-year-old Angela as a mature, consenting adult (as she was in my peer age range). I didn't see anything wrong with their relationship."
"Now, just a few years later (I'm 25), I no longer view high schoolers the same way. Now the relationship strikes me as very uncomfortable, because now I see Angela as just a scared kid who's in over her head."
"Still *love* the movie though.Watch it in ten years again, then!*The World's End* seems to have a similar thing..."
"Us older folk seem somewhat more empathetic/pitying of Gary Kings' longing for his youth...I always had empathy for Spacey's character, so I was prolly a weird 20-something."
"Everyone makes fun of guys that go through a mid-life crisis, not realizing what's going on.  It's complicated and sad, and guys that go off the script for what they're supposed to be are uncomfortable for society."
"He didn't hurt anyone.  He could no longer justify his joyless and humiliating career.  He tried (and failed) to resurrect a dead marriage.  He tried (and failed) to connect with his child.  In each case, understanding how huge the gulf really was punched him in the gut.  He tried to change course, but wasn't allowed to."
"When you look around and realize that you're just furniture for other people, there is a bottomless sadness that never lets you go.I remember liking this line very much, It's a great thing when you realize you still have the ability to surprise yourself. Makes you wonder what else you can do that you've forgotten about.Huh... I saw this film as a teen never once thought of Spacey's character as anything other than empathetic. I thought his 'broken man' archetype was fairly well established to the point that the decisions he's making through out the film are all 100% acceptable and interesting.For some reason I find American Beauty, and Falling Down very similar."
"Edited: cuz im dumbFalling Down has always been a misunderstood movie. It just gets a bucket of angry white man thrown at it and folks think they've paid attention.Falling Down is the over-the-top, balls out version of American Beauty. It's sad but also fucking hilarious. YOU FORGOT THE BRIEFCASE!I love that movie. I remember when I was younger and trying to watch it - my mom would always yell at me and turn off TV because of masturbation in the shower scene at the beginning. Then whenever I was home alone and it was on TV I would watch it like it was some forbidden fruit. I think that's one of the reason I love it so much, it's the nostalgy of being a rebelious kid.Look at me, jerking off in the shower. This will be the highlight of my day.You say that like it isn't true sometimes.Spacey's character just wanted his wife back the way she was when he fell in love with her. The rose petals from all of his fantasies are associated with a story from he and his wife's past. He wasn't lusting for the friend so much as he saw her as his wife young again.You need a ride? I can give you a ride. I have a car, you can come with us!I never watched it when I was younger.  First time I finally got around to it was maybe 4-5 years ago.  And I did nothing but relate to him.  Not the whole fantasizing over a schoolgirl part, but the rest of it absolutely.  I was absolutely miserable in a relationship with an ex who treated me like dirt and didn't appreciate a thing I did for her, I was working my ass off at two shit jobs that weren't paying me near enough for the bullshit I was putting up with.  Those were the kinds of aspects of his character that I latched onto.  I mean the guy was finally at his breaking point and just completely sick of all the bullshit, and he just finally snaps and says you know what?  FUCK IT, and FUCK ALL OF YOU!  He basically just starts giving zero fucks, gets some zero responsibility job (not my idea of a dream job but hey, he said fuck it and got something he seemed to be more happier with so go him!), and sits around in his garage getting high off his ass all day long and tinkering with the car he always wanted.  He basically gets fed up and makes a bunch of sudden drastic changes, and it just really spoke to me and appealed to my desire to just say fuck it all and get it drastically changed.  For me, it was exactly what I needed to see when I finally sat down and watched it.Similar to how you relate to the characters in The Simpsons as you age. When you're young, you relate with Bart and Lisa, and their friends. When you're older, you relate with the parents and teachers of the show. When you're older yet, you relate to Abe and the seniors in the show.Now I need to rewatch this because I thought he was creepy as fuck.  I'm in my mid 30s now.  Is it really more relevant?  (although, I am female)That's funny, my girlfriend had the same reaction when she was younger, watched it now, and still doesn't like it. They don't always change, but you're absolutely right. The opening scene is so over-the-top-accurately-depressing. ::masturbating in the shower:: ...And this is me. This will be the highlight of my dayMy daughter is 20, she has 20 year old friends. Good God almighty... I empathise with his character.why the fuck she hangin out with so many babiesI think it's his best work. I saw it when I was 50 and it is a favorite. Didnt read his charaxter as creepy. Just human. And Chris Cooper was feikkin amazing. Their scenes together...just wow.As a 36 year old father of a daughter, I thought he was creepier. Not just changes as you age, but also changes as your experiences cloud your perception.We don't see things as they are, we see things as we are  (Anais Nin or the Talmud) Not long ago Molly Ringwald was on This American Life and told the story of sitting down and watching The Breakfast Club with her 12 year old daughter.  The thing that surprise Molly the most was how much she identified with the parents in the movie, trying their best to deal with having kids in this turbulent period of their lives."
"I thought it was very interesting to hear from her."
"Found the link:  http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/526/is-that-what-i-look-like Yeahhhhh, wait'll you're 46 and you are walking through the train station and there are beautiful young girls all around and it hits you: I am never going to turn their heads in that way ever again without paying for it. Then you wonder, I wonder if that bag in the wind would fit over my head."
"Jesus does that hit hard.Or being 36 and realizing you'll never be one of those girls again. Looking good for my age is now my goal!Same happened to me with Daniel Plainview."
"There are times when I... I look at people and I see nothing worth liking. I want to earn enough money [that] I can get away from everyone."
"I'm so late to this discussion, but I'm going to chime in anyway.  Some comedian (I think it was Seinfeld) would make fun of a person who re-reads a book or re-watches a show.  Why would you re-read that?  The words didn't change.  The ending didn't change.  No matter how many times you read it, it's all going to be the same.  And that's true.  The book doesn't change and the movie doesn't change."
"But you do.  You learn things.  You experience things.  Your roles in life change:  child becomes teenager becomes young adult becomes middle-aged person becomes elderly person.  Or child becomes parent.  Loner becomes lover.  And so on and so forth.  It allows you to see events and characters with new insights.  It allows you to relate to different characters at different times."
"It IS worthwhile to revisit the works of art that we love (or hate!) and in so doing, we can see not how the story changes (because it doesn't), but instead we can (sometimes) see how WE change.I totally empathized with Spacey's character. I understand lusting after a hot girl, and I respected him for backing off when she told she was a virgin and scared.  A lot of guys would not have stopped there."
"I remember the wife being a pinched, materialistic, frigid, cheating, gold digging bitch."
"I think that people who would look at Spacey;s character as a villain are people who simply don't understand that life is meant to be enjoyed, not wasted chasing after money and material things.I guess this is odd or abnormal, based on all the comments in this thread, but I am in my 40's and I find younger women less attractive."
"I first saw it at 16 and thought ew, now I'm 20 and I find Kevin incredibly hot Is it creepy for a 32 year old to want to date 18 year old girls?he didn't bang the chick."
"So he's not a creep. Ah, I should re-watch it, as it's one of my favorites; just my favorites usually are so emotionally/mentally draining to watch again..."
"When it came out, I was in high school, and although I kind of thought Lester was a creep, I never blamed him; just thought his judgment was a bit clouded and he was trying to improve himself, although w/ some odd, misplaced motivation."
"The main reason I liked the movie though was the simple fact that the characters were different than what they seemed at face value.  Maybe that's not the takeaway message, but for me I thought it was.. that you can't judge a book by its cover type of thing:"
"* the successful wife was actually vulnerable and very insecure"
"* the good looking cheerleader was actually a virgin and kind of afraid to even have sex"
"* the introverted neighboring kid who you could cast as a pothead/weirdo was actually very mature and the most put-together character in the whole movie -- he even had 40k saved up, I remember"
"* the military, macho neighbor was actually insecure and gay"
"I like that.I feel the same way with Bojack Horseman. At any other time in my life watching that series would make me hate the main character, but it just so happened that I watched it during a bad bout with depression. *What an asshole he is... wait, I'm doing that right now* was the mantra that constantly got repeated.[deleted]K-pax. That is allSounds like OP has developed a crush on a high school chick...Why is his character creepy? Older men are attracted to young, in shape women. He chooses not to act on it."
"I hate how natural male sexuality is termed creepy.I think i was 27 when I first saw it. Felt sympathy for him then, and now. Not creepy at all"
"Can we quickly just agree it's one of the best movies of the last 20, and if not for kaiser soze, gives us the signature performance of one of our most signature actors?"
"Fucking. Love. This. Movie.Really?  I didn't think so at all.  If he had envisioned all sorts of carnal disgusting things to be done to her, then sure, but he pictured her covered in roses.  She wasn't a person, she was a fantasy, the ideal of something he didn't have when he was young, or maybe something he had when he was young and didn't think he'd ever have again.  When the reality hit that she was a virgin and when he started realizing that there would actually be consequences to her, that she wasn't the voracious sexual creature she was pretending to be, she was just a little girl acting grown up, and that there would be all sorts of real life ramifications, he stopped, because he was an adult and understood what happens.  Plus, he realized what was attractive about her he would essentially be destroying, and he didn't want to do that.  Not a creep at all."
"Other than that stupid fucking kid with the plastic bag, it's a beautiful, tender, complex movie.Good episode of the [Canon Podcast](http://thecanon.wolfpop.com/audio/40134/american-beauty) on American Beauty and whether it stands up."
"I havent had a chance to go back to it since listening to the podcast but my memory of it at the time was that even at 19 I could empathise with Lester.I was in my twenties when I saw that movie and even then felt empathy for his character. His world was being torn down around him and just as he looks like he might actually come out the other end relatively unscathed he's murdered. So interesting... We must be around the same age, but I never found Spacey's character creepy."
"He seemed more of an anti-hero. Almost like he's descending into a protagonist from some sort of suburban western."
"Until he is faced with the very darkest of motivations, and fate steps in, presenting him one last road sign: The admission of Suvari's virginity. At which point he cannot continue, snapping him out of his tailspin, but leaving him with all that cathartic experience."
"There is a Buddha-like quality to his journey, and I was just rooting for him the whole time. Until you're in 'that moment' with him, and you both are forced to reckon the logical conclusion of his actions.The worst and most annoying character in that film is definitely his daughter. She's mean as hell to her dad for literally no reason throughout. Classic spoiled teenager. Always aggravated me as a teen myself watching it. It wasn't really age that made me sympathize with Spacey's character in American Beauty, it was being involved with a loveless marriage that was circling drain and every aspect of life making me feel like crap, like I was somehow at fault yet nothing I did contributed to any of the situations I found myself in."
"Living my life like that for a few years really changed my perspective on things and when I rewatched American Beauty a few years ago I really understood where Spacey's character was coming from. Life had beaten him but he wasn't giving up, he was just tired of playing the game everyone else was and decided to do what he wanted without truly breaking the rules."
"For once in his life he focused on himself and his own desires instead of the concerns of others. After years of being the least important thing (yes I mean thing, not person, watch the scene with the couch and beer being spilled to see what I'm talking about) in their lives he decided to change that, at least as far as his own concerns went.The internet made a rule up for us all to live by... half your age + 7."
"Stick to that and you'l be fine.Hey, I had empathy for him even then, when I was 16: I wanted to fuck Mena Suvari too.I honestly don't remember what I thought but I didn't really blame him, she was hot and he's only human.I think it's all about yearning for childhood innocence and freedom, he sees himself stuck in a bad marriage and a job that doesn't complement him well and he sees all the youthful possibility in his daughters friend, he loves his daughter but yearns for the youthfulness of her friend (even if she is faking it) and desperately tries to regain it through quitting his job, smoking pot, etc.It never occurred to me that anyone would find him creepy, so news to me!Happened for me with Calvin and Hobbes."
"I used to think the dad was a dick."
"Now, I think Calvin needs a smack, and that his Dad is pretty damn spot-on..."
":(When I was younger, I thought Alvy Singer in Annie Hall was smart, funny, a little neurotic, but mostly kind of appealing. I cheered for them as a couple, and was sad when they broke up."
"Now, when I watch it, I just think he's a total asshole and super controlling and condescending towards Annie. It makes me really happy they break up... I actually think this is what we are supposed to take from the movie, but as an emotional teenager, I totally romanticized Alvy. OP don't be tricked! He's Keyser Soze!!I first saw the film about 3 years ago. I was in 7th grade when it came out."
"Immediate empathy for Spacey's character. His wife doesn't care for him, his daughter hates him, he gets fired (sorta) and his best friend is a young pothead."
"Without knowing how to say it, I'll just say that I think the film has more to do with the male midlife crisis and the drudgery/monotony of it all. The pedophilia (term used lightly as there is nothing wrong with admiring a hot 16 year old) thing is a clever way to draw people in and that's when you gotta watch for the hook."
"As far as I'm concerned, Mena's character is Spacey's wife. The fantasy contains the rose (petals) that his wife obsesses over. Mena is old enough to date the pothead guy with the gay Marine dad whom Spacey hands out and smokes weed with. Spacey only wants his youth back, and I think that's the core of the story."
"Because no man likes the idea that he's going to reach a physical prime and then it goes down from there little by little. Won't be as fast, as quick, won't heal as fast, etc. I'd have my 21 year old body forever if I could. I think for us it's more of a wish I knew then what I knew now sort of thing. Especially to use it on/for women in their physical prime. And I'm saying this shit at 27 years old. What the fuck."
"But as far as the creep thing goes, the problem I have with the concept is that there's such a thin line between admiring and what is considered staring that it might as well not even exist. To put a fine point on it,  admiring a 16 year old is one thing. It's natural. It happens and will never stop. We can agree on that, right? But what happens if said teenage girl actually starts flirting with intent?"
"Hell, it's happened to me plenty of times. Would I have been wrong to allow these girls to hang out (their words)? Yeah, we know sex can happen. But I ask because immediately the male in question is demonized as though adult women wouldn't have minded smashing an adult male in their mid-late 20s when THEY were 16. Why the facade?"
"These things need to be addressed. That lil line between creepy/staring and admiring is so thin that to me it seems like a strawman to get out of having the discussion honestly."
"But, ehhh...good film. Provokes a lot of discussion from me.When I was a kid and watched Full Metal Jacket, I symphasized a lot for Gomer Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio, the fat one). I thought he was treated horribly and deserved nothing that was coming to him. I couldn't understand why all his friends turned on him and beat him with the soap in the sock, he was already a victim. I got a huge justice boner when [](#s he finally flipped and shot the drill sergeant)."
"Rewatching it in my early 20's, I suddenly viewed the movie differently. I thought Gomer Pyle was a fucking pussy and should have been treated even harder to make him man up in preparation for the war. When he flipped, I got even angrier at him."
"Rewatching it now, I have a more balanced view. I see that he shouldn't even have been there and that the situation was just sad and unfortunate for everyone involved. It's just a fucking tragedy.It was just the other day that I (a 32 y/o dude) realized I've become just like him in the film (minus the fooling around with cheerleaders and horrible marriage)"
"- I work out (at home) to look good naked for the Mrs."
"- I dislike corporate life and would love to just go buy something I've always wanted"
"- There's no helping looking at women 10 years younger than myself and being attracted to them, followed instantly by creeper guilt."
"Not the best film ever, but does a damn good job of capturing aging male angst.If you know a 35 year old heterosexual male who wouldn't at least inwardly drool with lust over Mina Suvari in *American Beauty,* let me know. I never saw Spacey's character as a creep. Possibly I'm not in tune with the new normal and am a creep myself (lol) but it's not hard to image men in their 40's can find teenage cheerleaders attractive.Three movies are increasingly moving from fiction to documentary status. They are Idiocracy, The Siege, and if you're the right age, American Beauty. I'm just not sure which one makes me the saddest.My friends and I went to see this movie when it came out, and we walked out of the theater feeling on top of the world. Watching it again as an adult, though, I walked away feeling thoroughly depressed. It's incredible how well this movie relates to both audiences.You die a spongebob or live long enough to see yourself become a squidwardThe older I get the more I realize EPA was *totally* in the right in GHOSTBUSTERSFifteen years ago, I thought Mena was really hot.  Now, I think she resembled one of those black fish with the bug eyes.  Except for Thora's character, they're all people with serious issues.  Funny how liberated we are sexually in post tinder America.  You can fuck anyone you want. Hookups aplenty.  Everyone is the flavor of the month."
"Unless you're a man over 40.  Then you're a predatory rapist.  And especially if she is under 40.  Then you're a creepy predatory rapist.Creep read: Men I'm not physically attracted to.Mid-life crisis: A term invented by older women to describe a man who has worked long and hard enough to have money and isn't spending it on them."
"Creepy:  A term invented by older women to describe a man who doesn't have enough money."
"Funny how if an older woman sleeps with younger guys, she's a cougar, but if an older guy sleeps with younger girls, he's a creep. I'm exactly the opposite. I'm 40 now and I find his fantasies with an 18 year old girl MORE creepy than I did when I was in my 20s."
"Barf, gag, retch...nope nope nope. 18 year olds look like kids."
"I'll take a succulent 35 to 45 year old woman ANY DAY.Seems as though you missed the point. He realizes, fairly early on, that it's not her he lusts after, but his youth."
"This is demonstrated by his refusal to fuck her when he has the opportunity.He realizes fairly early on? Uh, what? It's not until the literal last second when he discovers Mena Suvari is a virgin that he realizes what an imbecile he has been.When its about a cougar it's all you go girl! Gender bias sucks from both side.Yeah but, Mena Suvari so freaking gorgeous in that movie.21 year old guys like 21 year old girls, 51 year old guys like 21 year old girls.*Breakfast Club*: a movie about a teacher coming to terms with his midlife crisis (while dealing with some self-absorbed teenaged delinquents). Wait til your 40.  You'll be rooting for him to snuff his wife and kidnap that blondeI was 18 when it came out and I was pretty grossed out by the old guy lusting over the young girl to be honest. I'm 34 now and I'm still grossed out by it. I think it's because I remember times when I was young, even as young as like 12 or 13 (when I first started getting boobs and whatnot), and I started noticing men - we're talking way older than me - looking at my boobs. Ew. I'm 20 and I empathise with him.now re read Catcher in the Rye and have the exact opposite reaction for Holden Caulfield.I just watched that film and I'm 21. I felt bad for him throughout the movieI think that was the point of that movie. Every character was at least slightly identifiable. They weren't complete caricatures, they were relatively realistic people. Depending on where you are in life, you identify or empathize with a different character.Having moved from the burbs to the city, I feel like American Beauty encapsulated Hollywood's deep disdain for the suburbs and its trappings.  I used to do a stand up routine about the nightmares of living with someone - the students in the audience didn't get it because they had never lived with anyone...but it was painfully familiar to everyone who had lived with someone. It's just recognition of a situation after you've lived it. I love American Beauty - fantastic movie.spacey is man out of space. The podcast 'The Canon' just had a really interesting and funny discussion of this movie and covered lots of these points in detail. Worth a listen. Seconded.I always thought he was fine. YES! IM NOT ALONE!The reason that is a great movie is because everyone in it is somewhat sympathetic even though most of them are kind of horrible somehow. This is completely and 100% true."
"When I was little, The Little Mermaid was for girls, but Sebastian was funny so i watched anyway."
"As i got older i identified with Prince eric, lost and looking for that special someone."
"Now that i have my own doughter I almost cry when King Triton changes Ariel at the end giving her legs and says how much he is going to miss her.Ahh the wisdom of a 20 yo. God that movie is brilliantAge does change your outlook. For instance, now at 44, I find myself thinking Ferris Bueller is just a snotty little punk who ought to straighten up and go to school.Here's the secret, you are always the same person. You may gain wisdom and knowledge over the years and it may change the way you see the world, but you are still looking at the world through the same eyes.I watched the movie for the first time when I was 16 and I've always felt bad for Lester I mean I know I'm not going through a midlife crisis or anything but I know one day when I'm 45 I'll look back and miss my friends and the girls and staying out late and going downtown and coming home at 4am. So I think no matter that the age you should be able to relate to him in some ways no matter what the age. I also here my parent (I'm 19) say ohh when I was ur age we... and I think I wonder what they would do to be my age for a day or a week they would probably do everything Lester did (without major spoilers) I think they would get high go out and have fun no worry about your shitty 9-5 job and live a little.So you are telling me that you are lusting over high school girls?That's the thing about high school girls, I keep getting older and they stay the same age. That anyone would think that about his character just goes to show you how screwed up we are about sex and sexuality.I'm sure I've left similar comments about this film in the past. I was a young college student when this came out. I remember my parents telling me that I had to see this movie, that it was pretty amazing. I finally went to see it in the theater with a couple buddies from high school. I was floored by this movie. I usually re-watch it about once a year."
"I remember being struck by the fact that my parents had recommended this movie to me. I was just starting to get to know my parents as flawed individuals at that time. For most of my childhood, I had been living under the impression that my parents had always been the temperate, church-going people I had known since childhood. This was really the moment that I realized my parents had made mistakes, had been disillusioned by the traditional American dream of a car and a house and keeping the appearances up."
"My dad, in a lot of ways, was Lester Burnham. He had been through his own American Beauty experience before I was born. He had quit his job and reevaluated his priorities multiple times. He had sacrificed his family for the younger woman he was infatuated with (my mom). He had bought the GTO he had always wanted. My mom had seen that too, and she isn't perfect either. I'm grateful now that my mom has finally opened up to me about her life experience and her relationship with my father, but when I saw this movie, it didn't make sense. I was simply left to ask myself who these people were that I thought I knew, who could recommend this movie to me."
"The other thing I remember was being so struck by this story. I had grown up in suburbia. I was starting to see the facade that people tried to build up to shield the world from seeing the turmoil and angst hiding underneath."
"I left the theater with my friends simply saying, Wow, over and over. Then the man walking in front of us out of the theater, holding his wife's hand, simply turned his head to me and nodded. No words. Simply an acknowledgement of what I was trying to rectify in my understanding of the world and the people who had raised me.Im only 23, but I can easily see how Spacey's character is deserving of empathy. You always want what you can't have (or think you can't have in Spacey's case) and when I'm a middle aged man I am sure I will be looking at college aged chicks like damn I would love to tap that, don't tell my wife pleaseThe mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. -- Henry David ThoreauAfter reading this thread I stopped and watched this movie. I had no idea it was so good.Man, first time I saw American Beauty I was 16 or so and I thought KevIn Spacey was awesome. Still do. What made the biggest impression on me is the ending: Every moment our lives is so precious, and the greatest blessing is to be aware of that as it's happening, to be able to appreciate every tiny second no matter what.Same thing happened with me, only it was Goofy in A Goofy Movie."
"Ever since becoming a father, I can't watch that film without feeling really sad for Goofy until the end. My mom realized she was old when she started sympathizing with the principal in Ferris Bueller's Day Off. She does teach high school, so I see her point. Another example of perceptions changing, for me at least, is Reality Bites. I was in my late teens when I saw it and identified with the what am I going to do with my life dilemmas that the characters were going through. I watched it again when I was in my late 20s/early 30s and it just pissed me off how insufferably whiny and selfish all of them were. Still has one of my favorite movie insults though: He's the reason cliff notes were invented.I was 33 when American Beauty was released. It is one of my all time favorite movies that I watch at least a couple of times a year. This movie was an absolute life changer for me. Creepy near statutory rape aside, I understood Lester at a very base level."
"The drone of a sales job with micro managing company/boss, a wife that started out fun and adventurous and turned into a pretentious hag that only cared about the world's perception of her, the longing to be at a point in time in your life that was blissfully low on responsibility and high on prospects all weighed heavily on my soul after watching that movie and still does every time I watch it."
"Sure it was a fantastic movie that was wonderfully written, directed, and acted with a stunning score and cinematography, but the insight into the middle aged dissatisfied male was masterful."
"16 years ago I thought Spacey was an asshole for not nailing Mena Suvari. I'm 35 now and I still think the same.Should I see this movie, is it good?I saw Spacey's character as a portrait of modern suburban man before his transformation. He was stuck in a dead end job, had a wife who ran all over him and because he was spineless she lost respect for him a long time ago. He basically ceded control of his life to his domineering wife and dead end job. So he was running through the motions and was pretty much on autopilot. His tranformation I thought was very powerful. He broke the chains and finally took control of his own life. As a result he was able to see the world for what it is and in that state everything has a beauty and flow to it including a blowing plastic bag.  I find this movie gets a bad rap these days. Yes it's white people problems. But it's an amazingly competent story, cinematography, music, characters. There's symbolism littered throughout like a book. The story also is very much open to multiple viewings. You get a different experience depending on who you empathize with. In my opinion it still earned that oscar it got. Despite what others say.16 years ago I was sure that Dunston Checks In was the best movie that ever was or ever will be.  At 28 I've realized it's maybe only the 6th or 7th best movie featuring an ape.  I'm 34 and I thought he was freaking awesome in that movie, granted this was the time I started my pot smoking...so I thought he was awesome and I wanted that ridiculously priced weed tooIt's like the Springsteen song Queen of the  Supermarket on Working on a Dream album. Hipster Rock critics rate it a 0/10 and call it the worst Springsteen song ever. It's about a guy who sees a beautiful girl working in the supermarket and is taken by her beauty and expresses a longing. For an 18 year old, it doesn't make sense...go in and get her phone number lamo. But for a 50+ year old all you get out of the experience is the longing. I definitely see where Bruce is coming from.  I feel for the guy, did when I first saw it when I was 16. Stilll thought it was creepy though, but I felt for the guy. Now I'm 32 and I think it's even creepier and feel leas for him. Re-watching the Lion King as a father had that same effect on me. I didn't feel sad when Mufasa died. I felt strong anxiety as Mufasa did when he realized his kid was going to get trampled. at 19 you couldn't understand the meaning of the film?[deleted]I don't understand. I watched this movie when I was 16, and it really marked me. Even back then, I understood his behavior, his existential  crisis and the 'wake up'  thing. Can you please develop what was your perception ? When my ex told me about the time she got horny watching her friend's dad workout, my first thought was, Hmmm, guess I'm definitely in her age range."
"And then this year, a 20-year-old girl confided in me that she was heartbroken because her 60-year-old dance partner called off their affair because she should be with somebody who she could have a future with.  It took her, about, oh, three weeks to get over it, give or take."
"At this point, I mostly think Kevin Spacey should have just slept with her if he let it get that far."
"Teenagers are all going to explore their sexuality come hell or high water, and we know it's supposedly our role to grin and bear it until we're so old they can't even imagine fucking us, but I've heard enough women talk fondly about their significantly older ex-lovers (or for that matter, married them and are living happily together) that the age gap doesn't really seem to matter that much as long as you treat them as a human being."
"On the other hand, it's probably super awkward to have your daughter realize you're fucking her friends and maybe you want to spare her that particular tragedy.Either way it's my favorite movie and I'm watching it now.Cool motive, still murder.If he's creep, then what am I?"
"I would've banged that blonde chick so hard she would ... have been banged really hard.You're creepy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMQ6UPgJRMg"
"This headline would be a good [showerthought](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/) as well. ;-)I thought that was the sub I was in until this comment...You like a teenage chick now?Who doesn't?That's what I like about these high school girls man, I get older, they stay the same age.Man, I loved True Detective...I think human consciousness is a tragic misstep in evolution."
"Edit: changed mistake to misstepWhen I first saw *Brazil* I was in Jr. High and was entranced by its dystopian/Orwellian vision. It was so bizarre and foreign. Scary but marvelous, fantastic and beautiful."
"Once I graduated college and was working in a cube farm around 1990-something I watched the movie again and when Sam Lowry walks into this huge room full of identical cubicles I thought Oh no, this is me NOW!"
"Then another decade later I heard MN Governor Tim Pawlenty suggest we bill anti-Iraq war protesters for what it costs the state to detain them and I was reminded of Mr. Helpman saying That is why we always insist on the principle of Information Retrieval Charges. These terrorists are not pulling their weight, and it's absolutely right and fair that those found guilty should pay for their periods of detention and the Information Retrieval Procedures used in their interrogation."
"Now 14 years after 9/11:"
"INTERVIEWER: But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year..."
"HELPMANN: Beginner's luck.That movie made me so mad at the end. I was like YOU IDIOT YOU COULD HAVE HAD SEX WITH AN 18 YEAR OLDI don't remember how old the daughter was but I'm only 25 and know I will always think girls 17-21 are the hottest. If a guy tells you he wouldn't have sex with a hot 17-18 yo (depending on the age of consent in your state) with no strings attached, he is a liar or gay> I will always think girls 17-21 are the hottest."
"Trust me. One day they start looking like your daughter.I work at a university. Seeing hot girls, 17-21, never gets old.  :o)That is very likely to change for you in the coming years."
"Source: I am a man in my 30's and used to think like you didI'm in my 40s. I'd take a hot 18 year old in a heart beat."
"Flat stomach, tight little ass, boobs that stick straight out, smooth, non-wrinkly skin."
"There's a really good reason why *barely legal* hasn't gone away in porn for decades."
"Just sayin'."
":o)These days you're more likely to find that on a mid 20s-mid 30s fitness chick than you are an on 18 year old.At 40 I strongly disagree with you. Randomly watched it yesterday.  When it came out my parents had just got divorced.  I'm 34 and just had a recent fall out with my wife.  The line 'you don't get to tell me what to do ever again' really hit home.  Spent the summer with a 20 year old and had the time of my life.  So I'm about to jerk it to the mena suvari scene at the end and i couldn't even come close to finishing because I was starting to choke up reflecting on the craziness the last 6 months of my life has brought me.  That movie fucks me up everytime I watch it.  A movie that justifies feelings of lust gets confusing emotional responses in a Nation where everything is sexualized and the couple are representatives of a father to daughter relationship."
"Anyone can justify anything in this way, but it's still a perversion, but alas, it's also an accurate representation of the American mindset.  It's ok to support perversion... pornography... as long as it's not my daughters... but it is our daughters and our sisters and neices that are being fed into that machine with every dollar, every click, every second of attention."
"I am saddened by this realization, that most choose to suppress this, to ignore it, to hide it, from self and others.Dig up Middle Age Crazy with Bruce Dern, even if you have to buy it."
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWBlKdCu8ToWhenever I tell my mom that this is one of my top movies ever, she gets this look of disgust on her face."
"I don't think she got the point of itIf you can, watch with the commentary track too. So many very interesting tidbits about the making of that film. This is really interesting. I recall hating this movie and all the hype surrounding it because I felt zero empathy for that character. I'm about your age and now I feel compelled to re-watch this.Is there a female equivalent to this movie?What does it say when you're a 19 year old girl and related harder to Lester than anyone else....Based on your comments, I have to watch it again.Life.I was 18 or so when I saw it, I'm 34 now....I kind of felt bad for him then....I didn't get WHY the movie was considered so amazing though.  Now that I'm 34...I get it."
"It's kind of like the Jimi Hendrix song Hey Joe.  When I was a kid it was my least favorite song from him....and then as I got older and older I like it more and moreDisney movies do not hold up to responsible adult decision making.Definitely. Perception changes with age, life experiences, knowledge. I do have empathy for his character, and a lot of other characters that I didn't before. One that comes to mind is the Baroness in The Sound of Music. I used to think she was the bad woman standing between the Captain and Maria, but the other day I re-watched it and cried when she and the Captain parted ways. The way she tries to be strong and act like she's leaving him, it got to me. Sometimes not everything is black and white, good and bad, hero and villain, etc. I was already well too old for the cheerleader when I saw it first time around. Lester's life collapses, which I can sympathize with. Admiring the hot young cheerleader, I can also sympathize with but don't bother lusting after her. It is fine to hang out with people that are younger than you but only if you don't pretend to be like them and not exclusively. Even at the time, I believed that they were Lester's mistakes. There is a reset button of sorts but you can't go back in time."
"I also sympathize with Lester's late peace of mind becoming a commentator on his own life.Now try Fight Club.I first watched the movie when I was 19, I think it had a more profound affect on me then I realize. I think it was the first movie where I deeply identified with a character. Both with his life struggle, but also his lust for something he shouldn't persue. I identify with Daniel Craig 007 and Donnie Darko, but not quite as deep."
"I really need to watch the movie again, I haven't watched it in years. I'm 33 now,  it's been at least 5 years since I last watched it. If you empathize with Lester, you should read John Cheever's short stories. American Beauty is practically an anthology of his stories. Start out with The Swimmer which is his masterpiece.16 years ago. I'm so old now....except that kevin spacey's character was at least 10 years older than 35.I watched it first time when I was 16 and I felt sympathy for him.Jk,llAs I age, I find more use for the phrase it depends.  I accept that there's an entire part of the world that sees me as alien, and that I will see as alien."
"Back to the topic: there's a teenager in my building who really should swap that push up bra for a burka.  Agh!Welcome to the cruel reality of aging.  Btw, your username says it all.Office Space used to be hilarious to me. Now it's a weird combination of fantasy fulfillment and an indictment on my life choices....That's what we in the biz call perspective. It's kind of Eugene O'Neill's play Desire Under The Elms, it makes it difficult for you to find any character you empathise with.I watched that movie for the first time last year (was 19) and I thought he was hilarious, lol. I had a similar experience watching Kids recently. I was 17 when it came out, and I thought it was cool how fatalistic and chaotic their lives were. Watching as a 39 year old parent of two made me incredibly sad.One of my favorite all time movies. My wife still get the creeps watching Kevin Spacey whenever we watch it. She always say that I'm going to turn out like him in that movie. I told her at least you acknowledge it in the future so don't be mad if that does happen. LOL. I found The Polar Express funny as a kid. Now it's creeping me out.Your perception ~~on movies~~ changes as you age..."
"FTFYI haven't seen the film, but I feel like I may have really missed out by not watching it 16 years ago. >Your perception on movies changes as you age..."
"You're totally right about that. When I was in school one of my favourite films was 'The Hunt for Red October', I watched that so many times, but never really thought too much into it because I didn't understand certain things yet."
"After watching it again a while back all I could think was Wow, US propaganda much? and it took the enjoyment out of it for me.I forgot who said it, but make a note to watch the same movie (or read the same book) at multiple points in your life. The story itself doesn't change but you do as a person, as does your interpretation of it.As a man who was in that marriage I can't agree more"
"I watch American Beauty as a 15 year old dude, and I felt like I was unable to relate to anyone in that movie. The only two likable characters were depressing.I like to watch movies again, because even when the movie doesn't change, I have changed, and therefore the story has changedI've noticed this about alot of movies,  I watched them when I was younger and had one perception about them, then watched them years later and had a completely different perception. 16 years ago I was 16 and I had empathy for him. You think you were immature?  Or what is your opinion? some thoughts change for every movie as we age"
"You and me both.  Didn't really care for the movie. I am 27 and I really want to avoid to be in such limbo soon. What can I do to prevent my alive from reaching that point? My girlfriend is soon turning 28 and this means it's high time to have kids... I am making enough money to become really independent in few years from now, but getting married and having kids will completely derail me from that direction. Buddies pls help me!!Don't get married remain common law, adopt a child instead of creating your own, workout and eat right, always peruse higher education, upvote more than you downvote, and you're set. You didn't have a lot of perspective. I was like 12 when that movie released and I totally got it. Loved this movie, barely understood it when it came out but have subsequently rewatched it a few times over the years, you can definitely relate to the characters in a different way each time.Reading books or watching movies through the years, the story stay the same but our perceptions change. I recommend going back and watching it reading some old favorites.I first saw this movie when I was 17, and I totally though he was a creep. So I've never watched it again. Maybe I'll watch it again in 16 years too...Nothing changes an opinion like time and perspective.I don't think one needs age to have empathy with this character, you simply, well, need empathy."
"From halfway through his character really starts to fit into the role he has fallen into, and it makes sense in his world. If it's creepy or sad doesn't matter, the matter is that he found himself where he was. The ending affirms this, he is just a guy in a big world, the details are circumstantial."
"We don't have to like someone to empathise with them, we can even hate them. That's what makes empathy so strong in EQ. Great film, great acting. You don't get to tell me what to do....ever ...again"
"Fucking classicThis thread is making me want boys for kids when I grow up so chances of them having hot female friends around is reduced, ha.I never liked kevin spacey growing up. American Beauty and Pay it Forward were like all I knew of him. The characters where just creepy and awkward. Then just recently I discovered the usual suspects and house of cards. Yea he is 10x better as a badass. This reminds me of watching this means war with my younger cousin.  Near the beginning, I thought the guy was being a total creep and stalker-ish and deserved a good can of Mace.  My cousin thought it was sweet and endearing."
"I fear for her.I don't understand. Didn't he have an affair with a 17 year old hot girl in that movie?Not exactly Kevin SpaceWeedthat was K-PAX wrong movie!When I go to the gym I just tell myself I want to look good naked Also important are how values change. Another movie that has this effect is *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest*, where rebellious youths associate with Mac and conservative adults with Nurse Ratched."
"However, these days it's a little harder to get behind her side of the story because her prudish reactions (which triggers a suicide) seem downright *puritan* by today's standards. In the 70s, when the movie was made, there was still a reasonable expectation (or at least, suspension of disbelief) that a man should stay honorable until marriage. Sure premarital sex happened, but it was taboo and offensive to suggest the idea."
"It will be interesting to re-watch American Beauty in another ten years and see how those relationships compare then.See my other comment u small minded pplI still say Lester is my favourite movie hero. He hated what his life had become and took it back.If you say so. I loathe the word favorite but this has been the closest thing to a favorite movie I've had since it came out. Spacey stops lying to himself, and starts letting himself have real feelings.Field of Dreams is like this, but in reverse. I was surprised at how completely ridiculous it was now that I've viewed it again this year."
"The brother in law spends more time caring about the wife and kid then the Dad who schlubs around the country, blowing the remaining family cash, bothering strangers because he hears voices in his head. All so what, he can watch old ball players play in his cornfield? So he can play catch with his dad once, twice, ten times? Grow the hell up, stop being so selfish, and get a job to support your family."
"About halfway through the movie, the wife adopts a constantly surprised, wide eyed crazy look, and I couldn't help but think she's been brainwashed."
"Plus when the kid falls off the bleachers with what, a hot dog in her mouth - not a single one of them move to do anything and just expect the ghost to help her. What the fuck kind of parenting is that?"
"Finally at the very end all I could think about is how their farmhouse (not to mention the way these fools run their lives) is completely inadequate to handle 10 visitors let alone 1000. Guess they're all be parking on the baseball diamond and shitting in the corn fields."
"Reminds me of Top Gun. When I was a kid it was all yeah fuck Iceman, go Maverick!. Now every scene with Iceman you realize how right he is and why Maverick should be court martialed for the shit he does.29 here.  You can be an attractive older man.  My 26 year old girlfriend points out ~45 year old men that are really good looking."
"It's easier for men than women."
"Nothing more satisfying for a middle aged guy than driving around in a muscle car blasting classic hard rock tunes.  im worrying about when i reach 40 and watch 40 year old virgin nowThe Grinch, anyone??I've watched this movie several times. Each time I see more of my life in it. I'm becoming Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey). I'm 55. i watched american beauty for the first time this year (im 18, male btw.) and i immideatly liked his character, i mean i kinda judged him for being so horny for that teenage girl, but i found her hot too and i imagine i will still find her hot when im 40 :) also his musictaste is really greatI remember watching this movie with my gf and thinking how awesome and inspiring it was and I asked her what she thought about it and all she could say was how disgusting it was that he lusted after this girl and no comment about the wife or anything else (or even the fact that when he had the chance he thought better of it).  I think she probably even looked up to the wife, come to think of it.  I broke up with her about a week later.first watched that movie when i was 16 and always thought spacey had the right idea breaking out of a life he hated and out of the amount of weirdos around him in that movie he was clearly the most normal one"
"the wanting to sleep with a teen thing wasn't really what made him creepy, can't blame him for doing that, it's the rose petal fantasies were what really made him creepy The first time I saw I felt bad for him, I was 16... is that bad?"
"It probably has to do with the fact that I though he was super hot, but still, kinda makes me feel creepy that I didn't think he was creepy.What is this /r/philosophy101 ?I was 27 when it came out. Maybe I was already a creepy old man, but I've always viewed that character as a victim. Of life.Still haven't seen this movie. Is it really worth all the hype? It's one of those I just haven't ever gotten round to, now that I'm closing in one 30 I'm thinking I should finally get around to.I watched it last night and I really liked it.99% of men are creeps, put them in a room with a hot 18 year old and they won't turn her down. The older guys saying that they would turn her down are just full of shit. >99% of men are creeps....."
"Tumblr is over there------->Locate your manhood while you're over there...No idea what you're on about."
"An 18-20 year old is like a work of art. A wonderful thing to look at. Knocking one off w/ an 18-20 year old just doesn't sound appealing to me. There's no commonality to our experience. I dunno. I'd much rather be with a woman who is close to my own age. Someone who has taken some hits in life. Someone who is just looking for a little love in a cold hard world. Sexuality isn't about conquest to me. Maybe I'm odd that way."
"Call me stupid, or less of a man, or whatever. It doesn't mean jack, really. My feelings about myself aren't dependent on approval from others. There are all kinds of people in this world who I think are...well...less than useful...I figure it's the right of anybody else to think what they want to about me."
"Gotta tell ya, though, there's a whole bunch more to manhood than a roll betwixt the sheets w/ someone 20 (or 30) years your junior. The greater measure is responsibility. Integrity. Decency. Honor."
"Good luck in your pursuits. By that logic, 99% of women are whores.  Put them in a room with a billionaire and even if he is 4'6 220 lbs. and pock-marked they will offer him a menu of sexual services nine pages long."
"You must have been a very immature young man to think he was a creep.Well, youth and immaturity run hand in hand...For anyone who hasn't seen it, I highly recommend this video of Louis CK ranting about how much he hates this movie:"
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7oy1pY8PlUThinking about aging, and reading the comments here, reeeaallly make me want anti-aging sciences to hurry up.Did people actually think he was a freak? He somewhat reminds me of Walter White The unspoken truth is that young women can be attractive to older men. It biology you can't fight it.Amazing acting in one of the best movies of our timeThe movie made me cry both times I watched it precisely because of Kevin Spacey's character who's like an animal trapped and trying to get a measure of comfort but choosing the wrong ways for doing so.I'm the same age as you and I'm the opposite. When I was 20 and watched that film I though it was great to watch him go from loser to bad arse and rebel against that corporate and suburban conformity, now the idea of a guy in his 40's trying to shag a 16 year old girl to soothe his mid life crisis does seem really creepy and pathetic."
"What really stays with me about that movie is the depiction of the younger characters. It really summed up that confusion and hopelessness of being that age without being condescending or melodramatic about it. Or maybe when you hit 35 you realize you're a creep.Your perception on reposting a topic discussed a week ago."
"The writers probably didn't intend it, but Spacey's character represents the self-centered, self-absorbed, navel gazing typical of the boomer generation. He is loathsome in every way."
"Happiness comes from things like work, faith, community, family. Spacey's character rejects all of those things and is obsessed with physical gratification. Very juvenile. >Happiness comes from things like work, faith, community, family."
"Perhaps your happiness but I think you are just self-centered and self absorbed if you don't realize that happiness means many things to many different people. >Happiness comes from things like work, faith, community, family."
"Perhaps your happiness but I think you are just self-centered and self absorbed if you don't realize that happiness means many things to many different people. Incorrect. When you spend so much time taking care of others that you forget to take care of yourself at the expense of your mental health, that is a bad thing.> Happiness comes from things like work, faith, community, family. Spacey's character rejects all of those things and is obsessed with physical gratification. Very juvenile."
"This is your judgement, but it's not the same for everybody. In the movie, Spacy notices that everything in those fields are a failure and don't make him happy: no respect from his family, no gratification from work, and none in can trust in his community (his neighbor is an asshole, and iirc the other friend he has is nailing his wife). He realizes he missed something in his life and goes back in time to catch what he missed: hot girls, smoking weed, shitty job at mcdonalds, ... He goes in an hedonistic stage in order to find his new self - I cannot *not* empathize on this."
"It's at the end that he realizes he's not 16 and shouldn't have sex with that hot girl who pretended to be a sex star, that he has his reality check.Thank you for your analysis, Father.If only that movie were as deep as it pretended to be.Fortunately, it wasn't so we're free to discuss it on default sub.Umm.. I feel the exact opposite. I was cool with it all in my late teens, but now that I'm an adult & a mother, I think he's a vile, repulsive character and I never want to watch it again. Pervy child molester. YOU'RE WRONG, IT'S TOTALLY NORMAL AND IT'S NOT LIKE HE ACTUAL DID ANYTHING...is what I'm imagining people downvoting you for. I like the movie, but its weird that he's redeemed. Not fucking a 16 year old doesn't make you some sort of saint. Isn't one of the major points of the film that he realizes that she is a girl and not a sex object and feels ashamed of his earlier lust.Why are you being downvoted, why can't there be opposing opinions without redditors downvoting everybody they disagree withAnd women who have married complete losers have sympathy for the poor long suffering wife. Good god maybe if he'd grown a pair of balls before life sucked every last drop of man out of him...Gross, am I gonna feel like that when I'm old too?"
"He was pretty obviously perving on that chick who was waaayyyyyy too young for him. I hope when I'm hist age I have the decency to stick to skirts in my own age group.You will still find yourself attracted to the same type of girls/women you're attracted to now. The hook is realizing you're just not as attractive to them. High school girls start to look look like kids though, so his characters perspective was definitely just sad. He was looking for a fantasy, because his life was a nightmare. Wanted to be a kid again...I mean yeah I get that I'll still like 20 something babes when I'm 50, but I'm 21 now and I wouldn't bang a 16 year old chick even if she begged me to. Those are kids man.As a 19 year old. I hate when old people even fantasize about young girls my age. For many reasons. I know its biology and people cant help it, but I just don't like it. I'm sorry, but I cant help the way I feel, I can't help the anger I feel when I google a rich celebrity who is around 50/60, to find out he has a model 20 yo girlfriend."
"I mean, is it just me who as a father, wouldn't like his daughter to be with an older man? I'm not a father btw"
"EDIT: C'mon guys don't down vote an opinion, or how someone feels. Lol."
"Downvote me all you want, doesn't change the fact that its wrong for an older man to be with a younger woman 10+ year age difference. I upvoted you because I feel exactly the same way.Thank you, its nice to see others agree :)SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS[deleted]For what it's worth, I think that any adult man past the age of 25 looking at high school girls in a sexual way is creepy...  I mean, are 21-25 year-olds not hot enough, not innocent enough?"
"Besides, young girls are stupid, and not necessarily in a good way.  Dude. No.Someone posted this two weeks ago. If you consider that she looks about ten, his character *is* a total creep."
"Now that I am sixteen years past 29, nothing has changed."
"EDIT: My opinion seems to have offended someone's fappingWhat is a 15 year old looks 25.  Is that still creepy?Funny how age brings wisdom. Now apply that to the rabid SJW's today and imagine the self-scourging they will do in the future in shame.He should have nailed Mena's character since she's in her sexual prime. Such a disappointment that the didn't."
"That's not how it works at all.  Males reach their sexual prime in their late teens but women don't get there until around 30.  By sexual prime you mean Mena was in her prime barely legal hotness.Someone didn't watch house of cards:3"
"As a straight male I won't be oppose to be hate fucked by himSpoiler alert! He bangs a guy in House of Cards?! I haven't gotten that far in the series, yet...For Frank there is no females or males, there are just holes :)True story, I almost joined the Marines after watching this movie for the first time. I was an odd teenager.I loved that movie.The older I get, the creepier I find him to be."
"Spend any real amount of time with teens when you're in your 30s, and you realize pretty quickly just how much they are still children.But that was the thing, wasn't it? She fit the fantasy of being the worldly hawt thang but when he was about to get the goods the fantasy shattered and she's just a scared virgin teenager. He saw her as just another child and that was bonercide. She was frontin', just like everyone else. I have empathy towards him while still thinking he's a creep.ITT: A lot of people claiming empathy when they were younger and watched the movie.Wtf I just watched this.I am 52 and bang all the 20 somethings I can tolerate."
"You all are dumb.  Move to SE Asia."
"All women fuck you for your money."
"20 somethings in Asia are way cuter than those fat assed cows you married and require much less money to maintain."
"Globalization, I think they call it."
"Or you guys are just fucking stupid.You sound really angry for how great you say you've got it.I am over the moon happy when I wake up next to a girl young enough to be my daughter.  So you would be really, really wrong.Your reply is actually not mutually exclusive to my own."
"I said your post sounds angry, and it still does, regardless of whether that reflects your actual state.He's a SE Asia sex tourist, a lot of them are like that. I'm pretty sure it's a defense mechanism of some kind in response to how unliked they were among people they shared a language with. I dealt with these guys a lot when I lived in Cambodia, and they all act the same. Kind of sad and more than a little gross. Actually, I've lived here for 8 years.  Not a tourist.  Just a guy who skipped marrying fat greedy white women and breaking my ass to buy them real-estate."
"Instead, I work for myself and my own pleasure.  That is what the film being discussed is about.  How unhappy Kevin Spacy as the average enslaved American male was with his lot in life."
"Sorry if you find my life of pleasure and leisure gross.  I don't understand why you think I sound angry."
"I am not angry.  I am also not trapped in the American Dream like Spacy."
"All the pleasure and freedom in the world is available to any man as long as he doesn't anchor himself to a fat cow who demands real estate and diamonds."
"I'm happy.  You are judgmental, because, perhaps, your dreams didn't come true?whatever makes you feel good about yourself, man"
"Your life must be so boring.  Sorry for you.Username checks out.I guess after many rewatchs you finally got the point of the movie... you either dumb or didn't pay attention.We all end up master baiting in the shower.  American beauty is basically just fuck you mom fuck you dad boomer trash."
"15 Of The Most Beautiful Cinemas Around The WorldNot so sure a theater completely decked out in mid-aughties Madagascar decor is really all that beautiful.Yeah a lot of these weren't appealing at all, but that was just a horrible addition to the list, if anything it made the list feel utterly arbitrary and bad."
"Hot tub, fake-cars, beds, all that jazz is really unique and hell just comfortable chairs go a long way, but a cinema with *more* ads is something I'd pay *less* to go to.The one with the cars is a restaurant as well. The car is your table, and you eat dinner while watching the movie. It's pretty cool. Not movie.  Clips.  40 minutes worth of clips.I know, Marty is missing his circus afro!That is put in and this is left out? https://www.google.nl/search?q=Tuschinski+Theater&num=100&biw=1536&bih=731&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=3T7BVMO1JYfDOYLpgYAD&ved=0CAkQ_AUoAg"
"good work OP[deleted]Clearly you don't know what true art is, you plebian!This theater with early california mission style architecture is pretty cool. http://www.sbtos.com/arlington_overview_edt.jpg Wooo Santa Barbara!Why the hell wasn't this one included in OP's list..? This one is probably the coolest theatre of the lot!Came here to suggest the arlington, too. This looks like one I've been to in Santa Barbara, CA.You'd be correct! :)Lol they put a picture of J-Lo next to Charlie Chaplin in the last one.Considering that placement, I suppose we should be grateful Chaplin was even included?Selena #neverforget> Lol they put a picture of J-Lo next to Charlie Chaplin ~~in the last one~~."
"Came to the comments just to make sure that's really what I was seeing.  What the actual fuck, Isreal?I would like to formally apologize on behalf of Israelis, A lot of us do have a good taste in movies HONEST :(. That being said i am surprised that place was even on this list, Its by no means ugly but I would hardly call it once of the most beautiful cinemas in the world.I would hardly call most of these even remotely beautiful.Dat ass."
"^^J-Lo's ^^is ^^nice ^^too[Shut up baby, I know it.](http://40.media.tumblr.com/82022f8e8c088f0046f4e3b441d27ff6/tumblr_mowljkhJit1qkdy8to1_500.jpg)That's not actually the last one. Load the other 11 images.I'm on mobile so I *always* do that. Thanks for the heads up.Huge design flaw in my opinion.  It may be intentional to save bandwidth, but it's still a poor UI decision. They should make a more visible warning that there are images to load.Agreed.  Just change the text into a normal button even.  /u/MrGrim we're calling you out!Oakland has some beautiful cinemas. Who would have guessed.And Orinda is only about 15 minutes away :) The [Grand Lake theater](https://www.google.com/search?q=grand+lake+theater&safe=off&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=XkrBVLynCMvjoASHjoFA&ved=0CAoQ_AUoAw&biw=1184&bih=591#imgdii=_) is pretty awesome too.I grew up here...Oakland isn't all bad news...smhThe Fox theater isn't a cinema, it's more of a venue.   I've seen a ton of musical acts there.  It's one of my favorite venues in the Bay Area. While both the paramount and the fox can hold movies, neither of them are really used as a movie theater, but rather for live performances. The Fox mostly popular and alternative music, while the paramount does more symphony and ballet style art, as well as stand up"
"Oh also the paramount hosts government events like the recent inauguration of Mayor Shaaf. I just saw Jerry Seinfeld do standup at the Paramount a couple months ago!Yeah, I don't think I've ever seen anything about a movie showing at the Fox, but it's definitely my favorite concert venue in the area."
"Oakland also has the new Parkway theater, which has couches and serves good food and alcohol: http://thenewparkway.com/That one reminds me of [Tampa Theater](http://www.amymartz.com/images/131205%20tampa-theatre-by-amy-martz%200157%20pstampa-theatre-photography-by-tampa-photographer-amy-martz.jpg)i came here to see if anyone posted this theater. Beat me to it. it is nicer than some on this list. I just moved to the area and have had my mind *blown* on several occasions. Some of these theaters are unreal. If you can make a bay area movie theater scavenger hunt sometime you wouldn't regret it."
"Edit: Just realized they didn't include the Castro Theater which is a travesty. I saw Vertigo there in 4k a couple months ago when I first moved here. They have a damned organ player on stage before the show. Shit is bonkers. I saw a 70mm cut of The Master there at the Castro Theater that was presented by the Pacific Film Archive. PTA, Maya Rudolph, a ton of cast was there. Just before the film started a little old man came out. He walked past row after row right to the stage and sat at the organ piano. To the left and right of the screen, built ornately into the wall and ending at height of the screen were massive organ pipes. As he began to play most everyone then took their seats."
"Then the piano and the man started to rise. He continued to play until the Piano was some five feet off the ground and equal with the stage. The lights dimmed, the piano player exited stage left and the beautiful red curtain opened."
"The began to play right away. It was a beautiful experience. My buddy couldn't stop laughing at the fact that Rami Malek was right in front of us sloppily open mouth sucking face with this blonde for most the movie."
"Anyways, cool theater."
"Edit: Found a [picture](http://imgur.com/oQMnmrJ) I took. Sorry in advance for the instagram-ness. Be sure to hit up Grand Lake theater too. It's also beautiful and has the best 3D projectors in the East Bay according to Pixar. On weekend nights Grand Lake theater in Oakland has an organ player before films in the main theater. Also a gorgeous theater if you havnt already been there. I saw the 50th anniversary of Casablanca there years ago. The organ player performed before the show. It was awesomeYou can thank the film society there. They lobby hard to get the city to designate theaters as historic landmarks so they can't be torn down. The Castro is one of them. Failing that, the film society try to buy or lease failed movie houses from the property owners."
"New Mission is another that was designated a city landmark and was left standing even though it's been closed for 20 years. And then Alamo Drafthouse came in and restored it, and it's fucking gorgeous. Can't save 'em all, obviously, but it's good to know that they care over there.Some of these just look annoying to watch a movie in and most seem gimmicky. Graumans is beautiful though and so are the others like it> Some of these just look annoying to watch a movie in and most seem gimmicky."
"I agree, but I have to admit the boat theater looks so gimmicky that I'd be interested. Just for the absurdity.I'd bet boats'd be bumping into each other there.Yeah, I don't see how you could watch a serious movie... but on the other hand what if you watched a bad movie with a bunch of friends and each boat had squirt guns?Let's get to building this beautiful beautiful place we totally just made up... friend.If I remember correctly, the boat one isn't an actual theater. It was just a normal public pool that was converted into a boat theater for the showing of *Life of Pi*. It went back to being a pool after that.Totally agree. Some are too far from the screen. Some seem uncomfortable. Some seem too brightly lid. Not a big fan of many of them. Graumans is definitely beautiful, but I do think the Electric Cinema looks like it's comfortable as fuck without really taking from the actual movie experience."
"I saw Dark Knight in the Electric Cinema and it was a lovely experience.I went to Electric Cinema a few months ago, there are beds at the very front with blankets too. Highly recommended.Been to Electric Cinema and it is comfortable as fuck. Though the sound wasn't great. But you can drink beers and wrap yourself up in a cashmere blanket, while you put your feet up on a foot stool. clean sheets after every movie?No, but they have a highly successful masturbation self-reporting system set up. >  brightly lid"
"Bare in mind these are pictures made to sell the cinema so to say, it may still be a fine experience when you are there.Some of them are just temporary promotions, not actual cinemas.Yea, this is more a list of 15 unique theaters. I know for a fact that laying a bed trying to watch a whole movie and eating popcorn isn't all that comfortable compared to a normal theater seatAlso, how about sitting in a hot tub to watch a movie. What could go wrong sitting in 100+ degree water for two hours.Not to mention I'd worry about the cleanliness of the sheets and the other stuff people have done in there. I lay in my bed and watch movies/tv shows on my laptop every night. My neck hurts like hell after about 30 minutes.you need more pillows. i used to exclusively watch movies laying in bed and it was as comfy as fuck. i also had five pillow cases on my bed with 7 pillows total in them (the bottom two on each side have two thin pillows each, then the top two have one thick pillow each, then the fifth one is a pretty thick but loose feather pillow).I work near Hot Tub Cinema and confirm that 'beautiful' is not a word I'd use to describe it...Sounds pruney after an hour of being in there, with another two hours more of the Hobbit left to go...That, and you're swimming in someone else's asswater for the entire durationI wouldn't want to see 50 shades of grey there, that's for sure.Sci-Fi Dine-In is fun, but I would never want to watch an actual movie there and it isn't beautiful.  They have a repeating loop of cheesy sci-fi flicks playing, and that's just right.Yes,  it's more of a themed diner than a movie theater.  I don't know about all of them but the sci-fi diner in Disney World doesn't actually show movies, just clips.  It's a cool experience,but unless they have improved the food I wouldn't go there again.  I haven't eaten there in about 5 years though, so hopefully it's better now.  When I went my wife got a hamburger that was essentially burned to charcoal.  I don't remember what my meal was, but I just remember the site of her burger was enough to know the cooks had no clue what they were doing.Yeah - not a movie theater, what is even worse is that what they are showing is a ~10 minute reel of different sci-fi movie clips...so even having a quick meal there you see the same clips over and over. They could at least make it an hour long! I agree with the food (its not bad, but its not good), its just the same counter service stuff (burgers, hot dogs, hot sandwiches) with the price marked up for seated dining. They do make good milkshakes though, and their fries do the trick. It is a good place to escape the sun/heat for a while and relax while you have a little snack.Believe it or not, the clips are actually about 40 minutes long."
"Source: I have a copy of the film. How did you get a copy? That seems like a really strange, obscure thing to own. [Ummm... Internet?](http://favim.com/orig/201105/20/fairly-odd-parents-fairy-god-parents-internet-timmy-turner-tummy-Favim.com-51076.jpg)Like [the Byrd in Richmond, VA!](http://ppcdn.500px.org/5058085/c9e7c17e019384e73c1b23323feea715fb3ae45c/5.jpg)  It's awesome and I think it should have been on this list.Christ. Are movies $50 there or something? The movie theater I go to smells like popcorn and stale vomit and costs $11 a person.$1.99 for your movie ticket, and they play second run movies 2-3 times per day, 365 days a year.  The concessions are also much cheaper than your traditional theater.  The seats are super uncomfortable since they are the original seats from the 1920's, but they are raising money to replace them.  But the beauty of the theater more than makes up for it.  Going to the Byrd is magical experience, I would recommend it to anyone in RVA.  They also do an Wurlitzer organ show before the Saturday night showings.It's actually like... $2 or $3 flat rate for all shows IIRC. They only play 2 movies a week there thoughThere is NO way you can put the Byrd on hear till they fix the seats.  They are super close, very old and uncomfortable. Plus, most the time they don't even let you up in the balcony. The seats are part of the experience! It's like catholics suffering to get closer to god. Except movies and shit.Agree. RVA representWow, had no idea it looked like that on the inside. Been meaning to go there, but now it's a priority next time I'm in Richmond.that looks like an HDR image... don't expect it to look *exactly* like thatI live there and it's really beautiful, but the seats haven't been updated in years and are SO uncomfortable. Gotta pop a few Tylenol after watching a movie there.There working on getting new seats! There's a huge fund raising going on.Hasn't that been happening for quite some time now? They have been, but last year they put forth a full plan of renovation of the whole theater which ends with new seats. Quite the journey, but it'll be great when it's done! [Here's an article that goes into more detail.](http://rvamag.com/articles/full/23559/how-the-byrd-theater-will-get-new-seats)I don't get why 13 and 14 are so great.  They look like normal movie theaters except for the printed chairs, which look pretty tacky anyway.I would take my local theater with their large screens and new reclining theater seats over just about any of these."
"I'll take functionality over style any day.I dunno, the one with beds is a cool idea.Unless they've got a full maid service changing the sheets after every screening, I'd be pretty wary of the beds. Could you imagine how much shenanigans would be going on?> The thought of laying where all sorts of premarital handjobs and fingerbangings went down makes me throw up in my popcorn.so if the handjobs were married you would be ok with swimming in spunk?it makes the spunk halal.Then you should never go to any movie theater.The sticky floor isn't because of gum or soda.I'd like to point out that the Sci-fi Dine-in Theater doesn't actually show any new movies on a film roll that repeats every i think 20 mins or so while you eat. Where is this? Orlando? I don't remember this at the parks.It's very easy to miss. The biggest thing giving it away is there is one of the cars sitting in front of it. I passed it tons of times before I ate there. It's on Commissary Lane next to ABC Commissary. Go straight and a take slight left and you'll be at Star Tours, go straight and take a right and you'll be at Streets of America. It's in Disney Hollywood Studios (formerly known as Disney-MGM Studios) right across from Star Tours.So you could start eating 3/4 of the way through a movie?They show a constantly looping roll of old sci-fi film clips.Yeah, but the food, as it is many other places in WDW, is legit.Correct. It's not really a theater, but a restaurant. They only show a short loop of Sci-Fi trailers and a cartoon. It's great fun as a restaurant, though, even if the food is so-so.Can confirm, it's more of a restaurant attempting to replicate a certain vibe than a place to watch movies.Exactly.  It's a very fun place to eat in Disney World, and I recommend it, but it's not really a movie theater.That's too bad. It'd be cool to have it serve as a venue for a variety of short sci-fi films, instead of the same thing over and over.I think it is to get each table rotating every 20 minutes so you don't have people sticking around for 2 hours ordering only 1 coke and fries.They can play 20 minute episodes of the twilight zone.Then people would stay all dayI take issue with #2 Sci-fi Dine-in Theater, Disney's Hollywood Studios.  It is not a theater per se, it is a restaurant with a movie screen.  They don't show regular movies."
"Also, wtf, #10 Movie Theater In Paris?  Live jackets in a pool?  Looks more like a gimmick for the Life of Pi #10 is NOT a movie theater. That was a special event held just for Life of Pi. Not a great list since as you pointed out, #2 is also not a theater."
"Also, the hot tub cinema sounds terrible."
"EDIT: [Sauce](http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/12/06/life-of-pi-paris-premiere-lifeboats-swimming-pool/) for those curious.The hot tub cinema was really fun.  Definitely fun to do, but you go mostly for the experience not to watch the newest movie in Dolby surround sound HD whatever.  They usually show older movies.I am not a germ freak, but you just know people are banging in these beds."
"I just don't feel most of these Beds would be sanitized between viewing."
"[I would much rather watch a movie in a cemetary.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Forever_Cemetery)Ahh...Now i'm missing the summer movies at the cemetery.I just feel for that guy in the foreground, all alone in cinema pairadisoWe had a theater here in utah that had love sacs. (Giant super comfortable bean bags filled with foam) and it didn't last very long. People spilled soda, food and condiments, and just their nastiness. They became awful and started to stink, even with the staff cleaning them regularly. I don't know, just give me a comfortable seat, big screen, dark room, and good sound system, and I'm good. I've got a lovesac at home and it's amazing for movie watching but there's no way in hell I'd sit in a public one that people have been eating and drinking on. I can't imagine it being practical to pull the covers off and sanitize possibly hundreds of them on any regular basis.Seriously. If I want to lay down in a bed or sit in a hot tub and watch a movie, I'll wait for it to come out on Blu-ray and do those things at home. [removed]Any backstory on this place? Where is (was) it? It was obviously being put out of its misery, but it just seems like it has such a history. The history/anthro geek in me LOVES albums like that.Was the Fox theater in Vancouver BC.  Was the last nudie film theater around and was considered (kind of) an icon.  RIP.There's no way that place is still open. Right?Well that's grossOh my god, I could smell the stank.For some reason it reminded me of the theater in Taxi DriverJesus, that place needs to burn down.Uhh, did they bring their own UV light or was that the cinema's own lighting?Is that the main thing you took away from those pictures?Thats an adult movie theater right? Imagine taking some kids to see frozen in that place, you would probably be convicted.Oh my god that's hilarious. I can just imagine kids running in between chairs and crawling on the ground.Now I'm just thinking of Frank and Charlie playing nightcrawlers.I like hot tubs and all, but I don't want to sit in one for two hours. I can maybe watch and episode of a show or something, but not a whole movie.Imagine watching an extended version of either of the LotR-movies there. You'd come out looking like a raisin.

"Was going to say this too, live about 5 minutes drive from this place in Berkhamsted, England and it's absolutely wonderful to go to."
"It has some real history behind it too, a lot of the cinemas in the OP just look tacky and gimmicky. How do you watch the film if you're sitting in one of the seats facing away from the screen? Seems sort of annoying...All of the seats can swivel around so you are never craning your neck to see the screen. Works really well, there's a bar at the bottom where they serve food and drinks. The owner is lovely too, he comes out onto the stage at the beginning of most movies to introduce them.On a whim I caught Silver Linings Playbook at the Orinda while visiting San Francisco two years ago and was not at all prepared for what I was walking into.  That place really is beautiful!The sci fi dine in theater at Disney is overratedAs a theater sure.  But it's a great place to sit, eat and cool off in a relatively quiet environment.  Most of the kids ( including ours ) are watching the screen so you can savor a few minutes of peace before heading back out into the crowds and heat.The best dine in theater ever is The Alamo Drafthouse in Austin TX. Love that placeI went and saw Interstellar there for its midnight release. It was glorious.I think its awesome but by no means should it be on this list.

"in Milwaukee is pretty sweet.I love going to the movies. the ritual behind it. I go to the theater with someone or people I just want to be with. We buy the tickets, go to the restroom, get snacks, give the ticket person my ticket and then to finally sit down and get lost into the movie. All my problems can wait until after the movie is done. Maybe get a bite to eat before and after. I think it's because it's what my family did ever since I was young. Downloading movies really takes out the experience I love having when I go to the theater.   The theatre experience is definitely one that's hard to replicate at home!

The disjointed sci-fi clips they show from old movies are funny for a minute, but you can't get into watching something because they just jump to another clip. That's not a theater it's a gross theme park restaurant.I wouldn't want to work at the hot tub or bed theaters. The number of people (Animals) fucking in these situations would be too much for me, man.the disney world one isn't really a movie theatre. its a restaurant and they play the previews for the old movies. what we figured is they don't want people sitting there for hour and half movies. but its still a cool place. always reminded me of the restaurant in pulp fiction :)Iv been to number 2 on the list, the sci-fi one. Its a theater and restaurant. Its nowhere near as cool as it looks. They' don't actually show any old black and white sci-fi movies, they just play a constant loop of fake movie trailers. The food was on applebe's level and it was so dark that I couldn't see my food very well and ended up making a mess. 2/10 would not eat there again.This fucking theater in Greece **DOES NOT EXIST**"
"Its been posted a thousand fucking times It no longer exists but in its day, I thought that the Waikiki Theater in Honolulu was one of the more beautiful theaters in the country.

Single screen theaters are no longer cost effective to run given the space they occupy, so in San Francisco, where rents are among the highest in the world, many single screen theaters have been shuttered and the owners want to tear the buildings down and rebuild."
"The city has refused, requiring the buildings to remain and their ornate features to be retained, and so businesses have started adapting to the theater instead of tearing it down."
"This was the first successful transformation of a theater to a gym.  The Theater had a wide flat area near the screen on which seats were mounted, and then sloped up at the rear 2/3s.  There were two balconies above the sloped area."
"The sloped areas including the balconies had structures added to tier them, i.e. make them stair step instead of slope, with 10 foot wide steps.  Onto the steps they added machines, like stair step machines and the like."
"The flat area near the screen was wood-floored to be a group class studio.  The area behind the screen that had held the speakers and some offices was redesigned to be a bike studio."

All of there.Cool, now can I pay a fraction of the price of a cinema ticket in order to watch newly released movies in my TV/computer?The electric is great, I've been there twice and love it. The seats are super comfortable, there are sofas and beds if you pay extra, and there's a bar where you can buy drinks and food at any point throughout the movie.I saw Interstellar in Grauman's new 70mm IMAX screen. It was fucking beautiful. You put the wrong country for the one in Jerusalem...I've always been keen on the interior of the [Arlington Theater](http://sbtos.com/IMG_8959_HDR_11x18_Tom%20Ginn_ps2_sm.jpg) in Santa Barbara, CA. At least in the pool one, there is a risk for my wife staring at her phone the whole time. The rest, forget it. Seems like there is a ratio of comfort to screen size. The more comfortable you get, the smaller the screen gets, until you are at home watching a movie on your couch. I'm disappointed the Casino on Catalina Island didn't get shown!There is one theater missing from this list and it is the Stanley theater in downtown Utica, NY. The artwork that was put in for this theater is amazing."

This is in the basement of my apartment blockI don't think that Bed one would be cool AT ALL. I'll fucking sleep at home.I have been to both the Orinda Theater in Orinda and the Paramount in Oakland.  They really are quiet beautiful and a fun break from the big movie theaters like Century or AMC's"
"Edit: I have been to the Fox and this is more of a concert venue than a movie theater.  I am not even sure they show films there but I could be wrong.Why is J.Lo there?  Why?  I resent that.0-for-15. I just want comfort and a big screen and clear sound. I want to see the movie, not the surroundings.Give me Alamo Drafthouse or give me death.

"Fucking amazing."
"The Fox Theater in Oakland is easily the most beautiful theater or ***any*** kind of venue I have ever been in. Every little detail is just stunning. I saw Primus perform their versions of Willy Wonka songs at the Fox and it was the most trippy thing I have ever experienced, even without drugs."
"Honestly I think the [Fox Theater](https://www.google.com/search?q=fox+theater+stockton,+ca+photos&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=3lbBVMmhGtCyogS7s4GIAQ&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&biw=1920&bih=943) in Stockton, CA could have made the list over several of these theaters. Stockton is consistently listed as one of the worst cities in America - due to crime, unemployment, bankruptcy, and just an overall shitty city. But their Fox Theater, now called Bob Hope Theater, is absolutely stunning. They regularly show classic movies (think Audrey Hepburn) and it is a great experience."
"[**This**](http://www.visitstockton.org/images/made/images/remote/http_files.idssasp.com/public/C102/81ebd2ca-eff4-4292-8d9e-9b233234a04c_640_360_s_c1.jpg) is a photo from the stage, [**this**](http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/99/44/a6/bob-hope-theatre-lobby.jpg) is the ultra classy lobby, and [**this**](http://www.roadarch.com/14/5/bobhope.jpg) is the cool retro facade."
"[**Here**](http://photos.cinematreasures.org/production/photos/80499/1378231553/large.jpg?1378231553) is a cool photo from the early days of The Fox, this must have been the 1920's or so?I wasn't all *that* impressed by the theater itself, but holy shit that lobby.Some of those are really ugly. Was it that hard to come up with 15?The Keith Albee theatre in Huntington west Virginia is amazingly beautiful. Oakland represent.  I'm surprised the Grand Lake Theater didn't make the list too, honestly."

"Legit has an organ player for special showings.At the theater in Greece is it okay to have sex? I know Europeans are pretty open about that kind of thing. #9 and #6 suck.ITT: people pointing out that the Sci-Fi Drive in theater isn't actually a theater.They would have to pay me to lie on one of those beds.The Fox Theater is not a cinema anymore, as far as I know. It's used as a concert venueThe first time I went to the TCL Chinese Theater my jaw actually dropped.  It truly has to be seen in person to appreciate. Every single aspect of the theater is incredible."
"They also forgot to include the Arlington Theater in Santa Barbara, which is beautiful and easily one of my favorites. TIL beautiful is a synonym for noveltyI would actually hate to see a movie in the first one. I prefer my movie seeting to be just uncomfortable enough to keep me awake but not uncomfortable enough to bother me the whole movie. The orange cinema club seems like you might be able to have a cigar while watching, that'd be great.Cinema? What are they? What year is it? What are Blockbuster stores?I'll stick with the IMAX. None of these seem remotely enjoyable for actually watching a movie. They're pretty, but being able to actually see the screen is a plus. My favourite of all time was the Royal, Heerlen, Netherlands.  It was an old theatre, had tonnes of space (you could walk 2 people side by in front of a person with stretched out legs in some rows)."
"It was old and needed modernising but the cinema itself was awesome.  Shame it shut.  Some days we would be the only ones there so then we would ask them to turn the Dutch subtitles off and forego the break.Uhm, why is Jennifer Lopez in the same row as Charlie Chaplin?Damn, I live in LA and I need to go to these theaters. bed. bugs.No love for the grand lumiere in Cannes, France ?I went to the electric cinema. Pic doesn't do it justice. There are beds in the front (not like the beds in yhe 1st pic, like couchy beds with pillows). The hot tub movie theatre looked nice at first, but I would not enjoy being in a hot tub for 1 and a half hours... Also the theaters are nice in Oakland cause that is where all the rich people used to live before it was the port. SF used to be the seedy place, and in Oakland yhere are tons of old mansions Victorian style. I use to tell people that I loved everything about Disney World, until I ate at the Sci-fi Drive-in Diner.  That is the worst dining experience I've had anywhere, let alone at WDW.  They don't play a movie, just an endless loop of 1950's Sci-fi and Horror movie trailers.  Those old trailers are filled with women screaming bloody murder when the monster or alien reveals itself.  It is literally an hour and a half of shrill screaming.  I seriously don't understand how the staff can handle it. My nerves were straight up shot to hell for the rest of the day. Not on the list, but the Open Air Cinema in Santorini Greece is great.I really think the Tennessee http://aiathink.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/21.jpg is a beautiful theater, although I don't know that it belongs on a list of the 15 most beautiful ever. Not sure it really counts since it's not a full time movie theater, but the Red Rocks Amphitheater is a very beautiful location for watching a movie. They do a series of movies there every year in the summer called 'Film on the Rocks'.Many of these are fucken dumb... people would just be distracted or uncomfortable."
"In my area it's either good ol' Edwards or AMC regal and their shitty uncushioned seats.The Redford Theatre in Detroit. A classic Chinese theater from the 1930s that has been beautifully restored to its pre-war glory complete with organ. No gimmicks, this is the closest thing to experiencing the golden age of film. I consider this my second home and will be enjoying Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade this weekend. However, nothing beats viewing The Wizard of Oz, or Gone With the Wind in its original glory. Genesis Cinema in Stepney Green, London is so awesome!  The Olympia is for porno, right?That olympia theater is just asking for troublesome of those theaters may look fun, but hardly a place id try to watch a movieWent to the paramount theater in Oakland and saw Horton hears a who back in high school. It was alright, I just remember being amazed at how big it was. And how there we're only like 5 other people there They missed the Casino Theater in Avalon on Catalina Island."
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalina_Casino#1 was an [Ikea promotion](http://en.rocketnews24.com/2014/01/18/catch-a-movie-in-bed-at-the-theater-four-awesome-theaters-from-around-the-world-with-beds-for-seats/) in Paris./r/ForeverAlone Jennifer lopez next to Charlie Chaplin? That just rustles my jimmies.I was thinking the same thing.  Then again, just seeing Jennifer Lopez's face rustles my jimmies.  Something about her makes me want to punch something; don't know why.These mostly look gaudy and expensive. The Seattle Cinerama is by far my favorite theater. It's beautiful, but not intrusive or expensive. While number 2 is awesome, its just plays b films from the 1950s on a loop to watch while you eat your lunch/dinner.  Still check it out if your in Disney but make reservations in advance (like weeks or months)I know it's cheating, but every summer they hold an outdoor cinema in [Sydney.](http://1.stgeorgeopenair.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/St.George-OpenAir-Cinema-Sydney-2013_1-9801.jpg)I always used to like going to the beautiful art-deco Tuschinski cinema in Amsterdam when I lived there."
"http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/2314/photosWhen I visited London over the summer, my mom put me in charge of finding a theater, so we could go out and see a movie. I picked the Electric Cinema because it is in Notting Hill and we were going to be spending the afternoon in Notting Hill. (Also, I really love that movie) When we arrived, I was a bit worried because the outside of the theater didn't look like much, but when we went into the actual theater, we just stopped and our mouths dropped open. I wasn't expecting that gorgeous theater. The chairs were very comfortable and there was a blanket I used during the movie as well. So far, it is the most beautiful theater I've been to and I'll always remember that experience. (The movie I saw was Begin Again and I really enjoyed it as well).I love the old movie nights at the Paramount! The seats aren't the most comfortable though...Imagine the amount of PDA that goes on in some of these."
"All the screens be so tiny!The thing I noticed above all else from these pictures: In the Greek theater, there are two dudes in a bed close to the camera.  I would not willingly share a bed with one of my buddies, especially in a place where we're guaranteed to be surrounded by cuddling couples.i think those are 2 girls.  definitely seems like a lot of naughty stuff would potentially be going down in the 1st one... those sheets would get naaaaasty. And theres one poor chap on his own amongst all those couples, poor dude.Hot tub cinema? Shit I don't want to sit in a hot tub for 2+ hours.My app is just showing some eyeshadow. http://www.quickmeme.com/img/e8/e87ce7813e25f1f079435db5d030527996fab500711a27c6d0f7decce3d49b93.jpgCan someone tell me where in Greece the first one is plz.

Also far more comfortable.one of those pictures is The Fremont in San Luis Obispo!I hope [#3](http://i.imgur.com/Lb38kPc.jpg) includes a top hat and a monocle All I can think seeing photo #1 is BEDBUGS!"
"Also, not one of these theaters has a screen suitable for the size of the seating area.  [The Memphis Orpheum]( https://www.google.com/search?q=orpheum+memphis&espv=1&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sboxchip=Images&sa=X&ei=LWPBVPa_CMKUNtLXg9AD&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg&biw=360&bih=511#imgrc=FLUsVsOyYoSY1M%253A%3BnDcW1DWI5TRbXM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fchoose901.com%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2013%252F09%252Forpheum.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fchoose901.com%252Ffamily-series-orpheum%252F%3B1600%3B1200) doesn't get much love on these lists. I feel it deserves a little attention, even if they don't show films that often. The Sci-Fi Dine in Theater is awesome. It's a shame that it has the worst food on the whole park.The Embassy Theater in Wellington NZ holds up against a lot of those."
"As did the old Forum in Melbourne Australia before it was ruined."
"Many of those go for gimmick rather than beauty.In Bangkok they have an awesome theater with plush recliners and blankets. It is super cold so it feels cozy to swaddled in a blankey. They also have a button you press and a girl will come and get you whatever you need. I was on a martini kick and fell asleep halfway through the movie. I think it was Paragon mall.Should be cross posted to r/architecturepornOh shit Orinda theater! It's always weird when you see local things online.Roxy Theatre, Saskatoon, Canada"
"Done up like a Spanish villa courtyard, complete with twinkling stars in the ceiling.  There's space at the front for live shows too."

"How could I have missed that?These pictures remind me of pictures of super elaborate high end home theaters. Half of them have aisles where prime seating would be or don't look comfortable at all. I wonder if those people actually like watching movies or just like expensive rooms.Hot Tube Cinema. That's an interesting typo."
"Also, I can't imagine that sitting through a 2-hour long movie while in a hot tub is a good idea.These are great and all, unless you are in the back and want to see the movie.Beautiful?  Not really."
"Novel.  Sure.Those beds would gross me outthose beds would gross me outTampa theater, Tampa fl more amazing than most of these. Plus an organ player before who sink into the floor before the show!

"Glad movie theaters are trying to improve the seating for a change compared to just trying to fill it with uncomfortable seats.there is a lot less movie watching and a lot more fucking in the top oneAll of the screens are so small.Hot *Tube* cinema, huh?~~Orina Theater~~ The Paramount theater looks beautiful. But sitting in those seats seems like you could just aswell watch the movie on your phone. The screen is like a postage stamp.It's not like that at all. Trust me.So I guess it's the lens of the camre. Because that really does look horribly small.Wouldn't people start fucking in those beds? That could get awkward#10 is not a Cinema, it's a swiming pool on a special event for Life of Pi premiere's.Oakland baby !!! Finally positive press. No wonder Greece has all that debt to Germany. Money well expend I'm sure.The Sci-Fi diner at Disney is great. It's not really a movie theater in the sense that you're paying $15 to see a current flick... you just go there to eat and they show B-films and such while you're eating."
"Haven't been there in years but they used to have this monster hot dog that was seriously like the size of a child's arm. So great. Stadium seating or GTFO!Where's The Castro theater in SF? Also, The Fox is not really a theater anymore. It's used for live performances.The Chinese was even more beautiful before TCL bought it and gutted the floor.Orinda Theater! Home town pride! Grew up going to that theater every couple weeks. Even when I was much younger I recognized that not all movie theaters had such intricate beautiful designs. It really is an incredible theater.I would've said Auckland's Civic Theatre is more beautiful than many in this list..."
"http://www.civictheatre.co.nz/web/gallery.htmlWhile the Disney theater looks cool. Having eaten there, the screen just shows trailers for old movies. The video loop is 30 minutes at most and gets repetitive fast.Screens are too small!I think a lot of these are quite garish/tacky. Plus who wants exuberant wall displays when you're trying to lose yourself in a movie?As an employee of an independent cinema, this post made my knees tremble.#2 was my favorite place as a kid.  Still is but haven't been in years.  Those glowing frisbees were the best.Allow me to share this tub of popcorn with you at the Hot Tube Theater.That guy on the right at Olympia in Greece is totally getting a BJ.Oh man that first picture is like a 9th grade date dream.

"Edit:  enhance!  Yep definite handjob possibility on 4th row 3rd bedI love the Sci Fi drive in at HWS in Disneyworld but I wouldn't count it in this list. One, its a restaurant. Two, they show a montage clip of old 50's cartoons and movies on a looping thing that never changes, not features. They want you to eat and go not spend an hour and a half or two hours watching a movie.How do they expect you to watch a full length film while in a hot tub the entire time? You'd turn into a damn prune! Nice! I've been to both of the Oakland, CA theaters and they certainly belong on this list.I just busted out laughing at work because mobile just shows a bad resolution picture of some make up. No Mann Chinese Theater pics? Even after the $5 million dollar renovation? I am disappoint. The one in Jerusalem made my eyes hurt. The chain with the printed seats are nothing special either. Good collection of luxurious and original cinemas otherwise, would love to see some of those in person.Some friends and I saw Tool at the Paramount Theater in Oakland... it is even more beautiful in person than in this photo. Just don't look around when you're outside (it is Oakland, after all...)Orindas looks nice, I couldnt give a fuck about the weird boat / bed / car setups. I'm here to watch a movie damnitI wonder if you're allowed to fuck Olympia theater Sci-Fi Dine In is not a theatre but a restaurant. Sorry.That first picture looks like bed bug heaven.There's a really nice small theatre on Coronado (San Diego).All of them made me feel forever alone. :(I've been to #5 many times.

"BTW, Alamo Drafthouse is a Nazi hipster shithole. I've experienced it for myself so you don't have to. If you want to relive the days when you had to watch a movie with your kindergarten teacher standing over you, this is the place. Add in the nasty, smelling and obnoxious dinner service of shitty food, and this is a theater chain I'll steer clear of in the future. The waiters are more annoying than any theater full of teenagers ever could be.Thank you for not making me click next 17 times!Orinda Theater in California is the most beautiful and stylish hands down.

Who cares if the walls look nice, it gets dark anyways. Most of the screen look small as shit! Those beds tho. http://imgur.com/DoBGYK3Id probably start fucking in the bedEvery time I visit Disney I make it a point to dine at the scifi theater. Just took my wife there for the first time over new years and she loved it. To anybody curious, they have a set film that plays on rotation. It's like a montage of really early scifi flicks. Nothing currently in theaters That one forever alone guy lying in a bed T_TAnyone know where in greece the first one is?I think the Ster-Kinekor Cinema Prestige theater in Sandton, South Africa should be here. Leather cushioned seats bigger than most of those listed , electronically operated and capable of turning into a bed , refrigerated cup holders, mini LED lamps and a mini side table for every seat.Also they have an entire gourmet menu and sell everything from hot chocolate to cold meat platters which are delivered to your seat by a waiter after a requested  amount of time has passed. The cinema is also limited to 30 people so its not overcrowded and it has a bigger screen.  I used to love watching movies. Before I met my wife, I would try to go to the theater every day and watch a different movie. If I could I'd see every movie in the theater and I try to catch as many movies in the theater that I can."
"That said, I go to the movies to watch movies. I like good practical seating that puts me in that sweet spot of not too close, not too far, and at just the right height. From my perspective, most of these theaters are not good for watching movies. Here's my breakdown:"
"1. Two words, Bed Bugs"
"2. Too much light"
"3. Needs steeper seating"
"4. Too far away"
"5. Needs steeper seating and too far away"
"6. Not practical"
"7. Gaudy but practical"
"8. Too big"
"9. Horrible, like a highschool stage"
"10. Ridiculous and impractical, where do you pee?"
"11. Looks good"
"12. Needs steeper seating"
"13. Hard to judge"
"14. Seems okay"
"15. Where is the screen? My local theater is so much better than these. They keep extra gum under your seat in case you need something to chew during the movie. Very thoughtful. You never have to get up and miss Gweneth Paltrow's head in the box.As much as I love the sci fi dine in theater at Disney, this shouldn't count because they don't actually show movies there... just a loop of clips. Cool clips, sure, but no actual movies. Some of these have seats that are practically on the same level as the ones behind it, making for a awful viewing experience."
"Plus most have tiny screens in comparison to the size of the room. Yikes!"
"Pretty? Sure"
"Decent viewing experience?..... Not really.MRW I live in Orinda and see our theater on thereI would spend more time looking around the theater rather than watching the movie.No Tampa Theatre? What other early 1900s theatres are still left? And this one still has a working wurlitzer organ... The Orpheum Theatre in Sydney, Australia is worthwhile also. Incredible on the inside."
"http://www.orpheum.com.au/the-orpheum/Fuck hot tubs man that would get old after about 25 min.Ok, so you're in cinema #10 and you need to pee. Do you just go off the side?just saying... the screen looks pretty small in a lot of these theaters."
"i think enjoyment of the actual movie should still be the #1 design point in all theatres...As a moderate germaphobe who is already wary of theaters with traditional seats - there ain't no way in hades that I'd go to one with beds.. I'd take those leather recliners at certain AMC theaters any day over beds, the horror!For all my Montana people out there, the Washoe Theatre in Anaconda is a contender. Pretty shitty town. Beautiful Theatre. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washoe_Theater"
"This is nothing compared to those but I went to a cinema in Bristol, UK and you could order pizza (and they would bring it to you) during the film.Bring a black light into that first theatre... I dare you. I don't think they play actually movies at the Sci-Fi Dine-In at Disney, it's usually just trailers for old sci-fi films if I remember correctly, maybe a cartoon here and there.Pretty cool to see my hometown Orinda Theater on this list. What's funny is that the picture doesn't even do the theater justice.actually the olympia theater is in paris and the beds were a one time thing done by ikea  to promote their new mattresses [source](http://en.rocketnews24.com/2014/01/18/catch-a-movie-in-bed-at-the-theater-four-awesome-theaters-from-around-the-world-with-beds-for-seats/)Just think, that awesome drive in at Hollywood Studios will be showing Star Wars...Around the world, where most in this list are in the US..

"Source: Lamorinda native. that forever alone guy on the first bed ahahaThat Los Angeles theater pride.I like how there is a guy by himselfNotice how in the bed cinema no 2 dudes were sharing a bed. There were 2 girls but not dudes. It's because no man ever goes, hey bros, you want to go to this cinema that has beds instead of seats and we could all cuddle up under duvets and watch a movie?Those are some small fucking screens! I'd take my basic theater with a giant screen over any of those. So who cleans those beds after every movie, or do they even do that?"

"When will I see this slideshow on buzzfeed?Picture 16 / theater 12 is the best of those shown. The best one would be a single couch mid way up and that's it. How about the Tuschinski cinema in Amsterdam  http://imgur.com/VcnYbvLThe one in Greece, well, my mind is just going down all sorts of dark alleys.Heard of the Grauman so many times but the inside is actually very beautiful with 'faux-Oriental' art. Thanks for postingIdk if the Sci fi theater should be considered beautiful, but it was pretty cool. I had no idea J-Lo was one off the all time greats? 15 of the most beautiful cum stained cinemas around the world.I love The Crest Theater. Pictures don't do it justice. All the walls are painted in blacklight paint so the skyline of Hollywood & Los Angeles painted on the walls literally glows. Plus the ceiling is dotted with tiny lights to make up the night sky - with the occasional shooting star flying by. Spent more time looking at my surroundings than the movie. Haven't been there in almost 20 years, but still remember it well... Here's one that used to be near me... Heres a Google search for the [St. Austell Odeon/Film Centre](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=st+austell+odeon&espv=2&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=6YbBVNuGDMjvUNOzhPgO&ved=0CAoQ_AUoAw&biw=1176&bih=730) Sadly it was covered in metal cladding in the 90's and then demolished in 2005 or 06... still it was a beautiful art deco cinema.pretty sure the only appealing one was the first... the rest look like awful places to actually watch a movie.Some of these have seats so far away that the big screen appears smaller than my TV at home does."
"*Bring your binoculars honey, we're going to the movies!*I hope they launder the sheets at the Olympia after every showing.There's ten pictures. Where are the missing five theaters?

"[deleted]Big Bad Wolves...I would personally remove the Big and Wolves from the title. It tries to be funny but it's not. It's super conflicting. They took a barely passable thriller and made it worse by adding shitty somewhat comedic music and threw in some poorly placed attempts at humor. Maybe if someone went into this expecting something other than a horror movie and with some kind of idea what the creators intention was it might have been midly interesting, but for me it was not. It's drawn out, with no suspense, and an ending I've seen before and done better. All of these scenes that should have been really tense and powerful and the two of us watching it were completely bored. Who should this appeal to...ISIS? Seriously, what the fuck"
"I was excited for a new list of horror movies."
"Fuck this list."
"The only upside to seeing this is that it made me appreciate how great Prisoners is. Everything I didn't like about this Prisoners did better.You are doing our Lord Cage's fine workyou the real MVPFor all other movies just google the name of the movie streaming. Usually any movie I want to watch streaming is on putlocker.Saving thisThank you for this!'ppreciate yaaweskme, want to check out the horde. although im guessing it wont live up to my expectations. too good to be trueThe Horde is the only one that is on the dutch Netflix!I love home invasion movies. I just watched Kidnapped. 10/10 would recommend. Not for the faint of heart. Pretty fucking disturbing. pff Netflix Netherlands has such a poor assortment of movies. why cant these mediocre horrors not be there? that expensive to license?Just curiosity, why are these films getting 1-2 stars??? Are they really that good or just crummy reviews?Here are the ratings I see:"
"Starry Eyes - 3.5 stars"
"In Fear - 3.5 stars"
"Kidnapped - 3 stars"
"The Horde - ~1.8 stars"
"Alyce - ~2.8 stars"
"Big Bad Wolves - 4 stars/u/tj229er, doing the Lord's workIf it turns out to be a slow day I'll watch starry eyes at the office.Many thanks, friend Just a note, The Dead Girl has been on Netflix before, but may not be right now. Beyond that there is another movie that is also occasionally on Netflix called Dead Girl, but a very different movie, but also could be classified as horror. Why do horror films always get such shit ratings on Netflix? I was watching Truth or Die and I can maybe see why it would only get 3 or 3.5 stars (it has 3 on IMDB), but lo and behold it has less than 2 stars on Netflix."
"What the fuck are people expecting going into these movies?I think those ratings are tailored to you, not overall ratings?"
"I had a whole genre that I've never seen more than two stars until I gave my ratings on a few. Then everything that Netflix showed me seemed more realistic. Canadian or American netflix? Before I get my hopes upBruh."
"Hola Chrome extension."
"Improve your life.Use Hola extension friend. Works for your UK brothers with shitty inferior netflix. If you get the hola extension on chrome you can watch all of them even Australia!http://lifehacker.com/hola-better-internet-sells-your-bandwidth-turning-its-1707496872Thanks!Get the hola extension for Chrome. I'm in Canada watching US, British, Norwegian, French and Dutch Netflix all the time."
"You wouldn't think it, but Canada actually has one of the best Netflix selections IMO. The US one has more, generally speaking, but I think Canadian Netflix has more quality movies. Anybody considering Hola should read this first:"
"http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/29/8685251/hola-vpn-botnet-selling-users-bandwidthNo. Research a different vpn. Hola is dangerous. So much so that chrome removed in from their store. They sell your bandwidth and use your IP address without your knowledge. It's not worth it For real? Thanks for the tip, just uninstalled. *Ha ha! Fool! Nobody watches Canadian Netflix!*US list.There's apps that get around this. For example, Zenmate for Chrome routes you to the US, thus giving a Canadian US flix. It tends to bog down Chrome though, I find so I only use it for that and getting around a content block at work. I can't even go to some subreddits because of their content without it, which is silly. If you're going to let me slack a little, at least let me slack how I want to slack, jeez. VPN.[deleted]only big bad wolvesOnly when it's Hannibal.Alyce is also on [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/title/70277801), as *Alyce Kills*. My hero[deleted]*THUD*Right at your door was very good. Do recommend. Wouldn't label it horror *per se*Was it depressing at all? I want to see it but the story sounds sad with him getting separated from his girlfriend.Not an uplifting movie, no.Its very depressing. Not on Netflix... Bummer, that looks like a great movieStory of my lifeThat sucks, I remember catching this on Netflix at least a year ago, maybe two.  Same with Horde.  Both cycle in and out of their horror catalogue frequently.  What was the last good horror film you saw on Netflix?  I could give you a couple solid recommendations worthy of OP's list.  Please do. In no particular order, The Conspiracy, Banshee Chapter, Mr. Jones, Apartment 143, Trollhunter, The Taking of Deborah Logan, Borderlands, Lake Mungo, Europa Report (if you consider that horror), Grave Encounters, Alien Abduction, The Den, Afflicted, The Sacrament, Teeth, The Pact, Pontypool, Snowtown Murders & Grabbers I enjoyed all of these and all are worth a watch for horror genre fans.  All are still up on Netflix."
"Edit:  This is Netflix US btw.  I'm not familiar with their libraries in other countries. Grave Encounters and The Den are absolutely phenomenal. Definitely diamonds in the sand.Europa Report is awesome, although it's more thriller than horror. It's a solid sci-fi mocumentary.Which is why I put 'if you even consider this a horror film'.  Netflix has it in both their sci-fi and horror sections.  Considering I enjoyed many of the movies you've listed I'd say we have similar tastes. I recommend Housebound to you- enjoyable with dark humor in the third act.Housebound was awesome!  I had to watch it twice, a second time with subtitles but I loved it.  I loved Trollhunter.  That one is on Prime as well.Of the pictures listed, every one I've seen I liked. I'm gonna have to check out the rest as well now.Well they're certainly not all equal and some have a much lower budget, for instance Trollhunter and Grabber might be kind-of closely related but expecting anything big like that out of The Conspiracy or Lake Mungo and you're going to need to temper your expectations but I really hope you at least enjoy a few.I enjoyed Lake Mungo quite a bit and I'm not adverse to slow films. There were quite a few excellent Australian horror films released around the 2010's like The Tunnel, Rogue, Triangle, and The Reef from the top of my head.I loved all of those ones too!  Also around that time was The Loved Ones, Storm Warning and Black Water.  Aussies know their horror.  Of course now there is Wolf Creek 2 and These Final Hours on Netflix which I also thought were good. Ooh, thanks for this. Of those, I've only seen Pontypool, and I thought it was pretty good. I'll be adding the rest to my list.No problem, hope you find something else you like!I don't watch horror often because I'm tired of wasting my time on bad ones, please do. It's a Disaster is a movie about a dinner party dealing with the attacks of a dirty bomb.  Very similar ideas, but a very different feel."
"IMO it is much better (and it is also on Netlfix.)Definitely the better film. Grimly hilarious.Per se? Fuck that, I wouldn't label that film a horror AT ALL. Even 'thriller' seems pretty far fetched. I thought it was a solid drama, nothing more.I found it pretty horrifying, but more in a psychologically unsettling way. The ending has always stayed with me!can you explain it to me? I read the plot summary but I don't quite understand what happened at the end? Was the soldier telling the main character the truth?[removed][Spoiler](#s The main character made his house airtight to prevent the virus from coming in. But it DID get in and because of the airtight seal and no air circulation it managed to reach deadly levels. So ironically everyone else was going to be alright, but he had doomed himself. Yeah the soldier was being honest.)damnOh hell yeah, it's nice to see Murder Party on a list, I love that movie."
"A fun fact, the director also did the incredible film Blue Ruin and used many of the same actors in it.Murder Party is such a ridiculous/silly/dumb name for a film, but the plot sounds like it could be interesting.  Basically, like a slightly more high-bow Saw."
"Does it have a good ending?The ending fits the overall tone of the film and I really liked it.It has a cute ending, it's more a comedy and commentary on NY and vapid art scenes.Blue Ruin is my favorite revenge movie, and I've seen a lot of revenge movies.Really liked this one, the costumes of Pris from Blade Runner and one of the Baseball Furies from The Warriors really show what film buffs they are.Yea that film seriously does not get enough creditCommenting to watch layer! Came here to say how awesome Murder Party is. Rented it with some friends and it became an instant classic."
"That MacGyver scene!Yeah Murder Party was fucking awesome!The scariest one is when the link is broken.I wasn't interested in Murder Party until you mentioned Blue Ruin. Maybe I'll check it out now.The synopsis sounded a lot like Clue. I love Clue, and murder party is literally the worst movie I have ever seen. I caught it at a film festival years ago and my friends and I still use it as our benchmark for bad movies."
"It's so incredibly lazy and portly conceived, yet at the same time is so convinced that it's cleverly skewering the pretentiousness of the art scene while being far worse than any of it's targets."
"I go to a lot of film festivals and see a lot of low budget movies. Many of them don't ultimately work, but I'm willing to give the filmmakers the benefit of the doubt. Murder Party just insults its audience's intelligence from beginning to end and then asks to be applauded for its bravery. Wow I forgot about murder party.  The closet scene was the best.Blue Ruin was excellent, so I'm definitely interested in Murder Party.Met the star and director of Blue Ruin at a screening for it at my school. They were so humble and grateful to even be making films, no matter how much money they made.I love murder party! Sadly, all my friends hated it and we're angry at me after I recommended they watch it. But these are also the same friends who hate it's always sunny so, what do they know?I think it's time to get new friends. Why don't I strap on my friend helmet and squeeze down into a friend cannon and fire off into friend land?!Where friends grow on friendies!!!"
"apparently Green Room is incredible, so that's great for Jeremy After Blue Ruin I'm excited to see anything he does. I hope he sticks to tense films, because he's really good at it.Is that out yet?  Iv been waiting for green room to come out for a while now.it's still doing the festival circuit I think, but early reviews have been ridiculously high I loved Blue Ruin so I'm in.I could feel the cool and wet southern air in my nostrils and on my skin watching that movie.Just saw Blue Ruin last night, tracking Murder Party down now.Murder Party is great. Good horror, dark comedy mix. From someone who loves horror movies you are in for a treat for seeing it the first time.Just saw Triangle. I wish I knew of it sooner, that movie was a trip.Hell yes.  Loved that movie.  It's not horror, but you might want to check out Primer if you haven't already.  It's the same kind of labyrinthine time-travel mindfuck.  Triangle seems to have lots of plot holes until you realize that's the whole point. Good stuff.I just watched that the other night and LOVED IT. It was an imdb recommendation for people who liked Coherence, which was also fucking amazing. I watched Coherence and Triangle back to back and hoooolllyy shit those movies were fucking awesome. I love how you get to about 28 minutes in, and it feels like the third act. I was watching it and thinking This is either a really short film, or I suddenly have no idea where this is going. Which is the feeling you want in a horror film."
"Very overlooked movie right here.Yeah, that turned up on my Netflix a while back and I kind of reluctantly watched it--It looked like a pretty low budget cheesey horror movie and I just wasn't prepared to enjoy it."
"But I was *very* pleasantly surprised. I'm not sure I'd call it horror, though--It's creepy but not outright scary. Definitely a good movie and a total head trip. Primer-ish in some regard.Check out TimeCrimes.  It's a spanish flick so it's subtitled but it handles some of the themes of time travel really well.  I saw it before I saw Triangle so I'm a bit biased towards it but I'd recommend it for sure.That film has one of the coolest holy shit moments in film. I'm sure you know which one I'm referring to...Can I asked what holy shit moment in particular you're referring to? I just finished watching it - curious as to what your thoughts are because there wasn't one in particular that stood out for me, but maybe I'm just weird ha.I just watched it because of these comments and I actually have no idea which of the many holy shit moments youre referring to...You may not have had the same reaction as me, but I thought this scene was insane..."
"[Triangle Spoiler](#s The scene where Jess trails the bleeding Sally around a corner and sees a pile of other dead Sally's from the previous loops. )"
"That one stayed with me the most!Murder Party is awesome. If I remember right, in the credits, the cat is credited for his role and the cats real name is Puff Snooty or something. Ah yes, Puff Snooty, very underrated actor. Loved his interview on the tonight show. I've been burned by a lot of horror movie recommendations on here.  Here's hoping this list is better than the others I've seen.Me too, I think it's largely a result of people never listing the horror subgenre."
"I cannot stand torture/gore porn that became all the rage for example. Would be nice if people mentioned if it was non-English as well. While language isn't a deal breaker it is important to know if I'll be reading the whole movie or not because sometimes that's just not the mood I'm in.If someone starts their recommendations with Murder Party, I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and check out the rest.Okay well, do not watch the Horde. It's a complete turd. Consider yourself warned.What are you looking for in a horror movie? What are some of your favs?Super excited to watch these!Imdb ratings on most of them aren't great. I'm guessing most will disappoint you. Why are good horror movies so hard to make?A good horror movie has to have more than a regular movie."
"Action/adventure: purpose, setting, pace, pretty actors, music that matches the tone"
"Romance: setting, pace, pretty actors"
"Horror movie: purpose, setting, emotions that indirectly lead to hopelessness, potent atmosphere, logical dialogue. A director who knows when to play and not to play music, zero jump scares(jump scares are an adrenalin rush, they aren't horrifying), logical dialogue, fun physics, horror."
"Horror films are very polarizing. Theres many niches within the genre and what is considered scary is very subjective."
"I wouldnt put too much stake into audience ratings for horrors. When watching a horror film, being unsure about how you will react comes with the territory. Theres been lowly rated films i loved and highly rated films i went meh.I've rarely ever liked a horror movie with under 6.5 imdb rating. I find at those under 6.5 tend to be cliche horror movies or very strange horror movie. I guess with horror movies, I either love them or hate themSame reason it's so hard to make a good romcom. You're punished for originality or creativity. People come expecting specific types of events, done in a specific way. If you give them anything else there's a small chance they'll enjoy it. But there's a far better chance that they'll just give it a low rating on IMDB and call it terrible. Unless you're referencing the ways studios handle it(I don't know anything about that) I disagree. A lot of horror films just miss the point of dialogue that makes sense and instead cram in a bunch of jump scares that completely break the fourth wall.IMdb ratings on horror films really aren't a good metric for their quality. Horror films are SO polarizing because if they're not scary they're boring. I think Paranormal Activity deserves an 8.0 because it is literally the most unnerving and terrifying film I've seen, but a lot of people would say the opposite. You kinda need to go in cold, the ratings aren't that reliable here.The ratings on Netflix are even worse, even lower than IMDB.I don't even understand how they set the ratings, but then again how the heck would you set the ratings for shows on a medium you own?One of the first dates that my (now) husband and I went on was seeing the first Paranormal Activity. I absolutely LOVE horror movies, my favorite genre by far. I had no idea that he 1) didn't like horror movies and 2) was especially freaked out by possession / demons from his Christian upbringing."
"He clutched my arm as if he were drowning and screamed like a bitch. I loved it. Feeling his intensity really brought out the feelings I think they were trying to get across - that unnerving, what-if-this-happened-to-me... He was so IN it."
"I felt a bit bad about it later when he told me that he couldn't even finish watching The Exorcism of Emily Rose by himself without getting scared and stopping the movie.Babadook is a good horror movie thats pretty intense. Baba.....dook...dook...dookI disagree, it was drawn out and had bad editing choices. The short film it's based on was slightly better and got the point across more succinctly.I love recommending movies to people.  It's just something I'm passionate about.  It sucks you felt 'burned' cause I can assure you that it probably wasn't any personal slight.  What was the last horror film you saw and really liked?Just watched Starry Eyes, it was thoroughly enjoyable. Gypsy son of a bitch burned us! Seriously though, I agree.Most of the films on the list are really solid films that never got much exposure. One of the better recommendation lists i've seen on here.Are any of these torture porn? Not so much into that recent turn of the genre. What's up with that? I'm not a fan.Kidnapped is one of the worst films I have ever had the displeasure to watch. There is zero value in it except to watch people get tortured. Don't do it to yourself.That's the problem, I think, both of this list and contemporary horror in general. A few torture porn flicks were immensely successful, so now they try to emulate their success with even more brutal nonsense."
"The true masters of the genre relied on psychological effects over gore, character development over character dismemberment."
"This list reads like the BestOf of three years' worth of torture porn.(Spoilers for Silence of the Lambs)"
"One of the best uses of gore I've ever seen in a film is when they burst into the cage room to find that Lecter has strung the guard up by his entrails, like a bloody angel."
"It's a perfect moment, because the audience have been entranced by Lecter's wit and his relationship with Starling throughout the film, only to discover in an instant that he really is a monstrously cruel and evil person."
"So yeah fuck torture porn. It's like a child wanting to eat whipped cream for dinner.Fuck, I wish people who liked torture porn would realise that not everyone considers this enjoyable, I've read a lot of horror recommendation lists that end up being 50% TP. It's a separate sub genre and a lot of people don't get this. I went to a horror film festival a few years back and caught Neighbor because a bunch of people told me it was awesome, after watching a chick jam a glass rod inside a guys dick and break it I was done with the genre.Well, TP is less of a sub-genre, and more of an extreme. Being tortured and mutilated is maybe one of the most horrifying things possible, so any movie that shows torture in a blunt, up close manner, is going to freak most people out."
"It's about how deep you want to dive. For example, Martyrs has some pretty brutal scenes, but I would argue that it's maybe one of the most effective films in it's genre.My wife and I are horror buffs and hate TP.  It's just not for us.Yeah I prefer a rubber monster suit with a fog machine myself. Horror movie junkie reporting for duty! I just watched 'It Follows', super creepy, with a pretty novel yet unnerving to the core plot. I found it pretty refreshing, I feel a lot of horror flicks lately are the same old shit.+1 for It Follows"
"Great movie. Also, soundtrack was amazing. yup, that soundtrack was just superb.Yup, without a doubt the best horror movie of last couple of years.Have you seen As above so below? This film deserves more praise.I have quite a few gripes with AASB - mainly the unlikeable protagonist who gets her friends killed, and an incredibly weak finale. It's got good atmosphere for most of the film and the scene where the cameraman gets stuck in the bones is one of the scariest I've ever seen, but the car scene was hilarious for all the wrong reasons and it seems like they ran out of ideas after that point. Enjoyable enough to spend 2 hours on, but still not as good as It Follows, The Battery, Oculus, The Babadook, The Taking of Deborah Logan, etc.No but cheers for the recommendation I will check it out.Do it! My favorite horror in a long time.I love the part of that movie where translated ancient text still somehow rhymes in English.That part made me laugh. Solid movie otherwise.Hey, if he's fluent enough, he could twist the words to make it rhyme without losing meaning. But I seriously doubt he's that fluent in, what was it, Aramaic?Yeah."
"And I love Papillon, who the police will never catch.This movie started out so well and just got worse as it went along, in a bad way. The ending was atrocious. I was pretty disappointed in the direction they took it.  I thought it would be a more personal journey, with the main character struggling against an unknowable, unstoppable force.  Then the hair floating scene happens and the movie becomes Scooby Doo and the Gang vs an invisible strong dude.  I still liked it, but I think it could have been much better.  Yeah, that hair scene really bugged me. Gee, my only goal is to kill this person but let me play with her hair for a minute. But it jumps that one guy as soon as it is a couple of feet away???"
"I'm sorta with you here... Just up til about where the monster starts haunting her, is when it was most spooky. Otherwise I thought it was lame... One of my fav movie endings in years, to each his own I guess(Vague, veiled spoilers) I didn't like it. The monster abandons his own rules in several different ways. They could've come up with a really novel and interesting way of beating it, but all we got was a scene where it acts in ways completely unprecedented in (and even contrary to) its own lore."
"I liked the movie. I didn't like the end.How does it break its own rules? The only thing that suggests that is that at one point it doesn't walk into an obvious death trap. And even then it only got scarier because it showed it wasn't a complete fucking moron.Seriously! Fantastic film. It was one where I may not have been completely scared while watching it, but afterwards it creeped me out.Isn't it great? I mean, it was a bit of a mashup of other horror films in some ways, but I took it as more of a love letter to late 70s/early 80s horror films.  Eh, it was kind of creepy at times but that wasn't due to the follower and more due to the environment. It honestly seemed more like a monster movie by the end of it than a thriller which is not what I was expecting or hoping for.Best horror movie of the year so far. It reminded me of Under the Skin, in it's mood and subject. Do you have any recommendation with alot of jump scares? i don't really get scared and get creeped out, but i get surprised very easily.You're Next has a few solid jumps and is a hell of a lot of fun too.Drag Me To Hell. That movie is one big jumpscare.Honestly jump scares don't get me that often. The last one I really remember was Predators because it was just completely unexpected not being a horror movie, I was ready to get up and run outta the cinema. Yes. It Follows was absolutely amazing. I've rarely felt so nervous throughout an entire movie.Have this sitting around and haven't watched it yet. I'm worried I've seen too much hype and won't enjoy it as much as a result. Still good even with all the hype.  It's a horror movie with a good sound track, pretty good cinematography and some good old classic jump scares.  It's not the greatest of all time, the people that don't like it are just extra sinister about it because other people say it's great, so they take it as a personal vendetta to let you know it sucks in their opinion.  It's definitely not the greatest horror movie ever, but in my opinion it's certainly one of the best in quite some time.  At least for one that was in major theaters. I loved itI watched this movie due to the hype. No doubt the cinematography and direction was great. However, it felt somewhat flat and lifeless to me. The cinematography was just over stylistic and pretentious and the direction was cheap. There were a few good scares but I really wouldn't recommend it.

The cinematography was just over stylistic and pretentious and the direction was cheap. There were a few good scares but I really wouldn't recommend it.   It's funny, my brother and I loved It Follows to a ridiculous degree. We're both big fans of originality, and really appreciated the level of craft that went into the film to make it feel both vintage and futuristic. I guess it'd be fair to say with have semi-pretentious tastes, but there was just this amazing sense of dread throughout the entire film."
"However I dragged some of my self-proclaimed horror-buff friends along to a late night showing and they quite vocally hated it for the lack of outright scares, and found that the whole thing silly. It's funny how films like this can polarise audiences.Well horror movies do tend to leave people lifelessI really enjoyed the atmosphere but I was frustrated by the acting. Flat and lifeless pretty much hits the nail on the head.You may be right, but when I watched it I kind of thought the characters were *supposed* to be flat and lifeless for most of the movie they were completely sleep deprived and exhausted. Honestly I found their quietness refreshing compared to some other horror movies where everyone's constantly yelling and screaming at everything."
"Anyways, with movies like this that aren't necessarily fast paced or super action packed, there's always one group of the audience who feel that it's atmospheric, and that the quiet moments make the less-quiet moments much more intense and meaningful. Then there's usually another group of the audience who feel that the quiet parts of the movie are boring. Neither side is wrong, but that could be why movies like this are often polarizing. It wasn't so much the lack of dialogue as the way they reacted to situations. I was just very aware that they were acting and that made it hard to get into the flick, I hope that makes sense. Despite my gripes I still enjoyed it and wouldn't hesitate to watch another movie by this director.I thought it was prety great up untill the last ten minutes or so which kinda just leaves you thinking  okay so is that it...While I wasn't blown away... and I'm still not sure if I even really liked it or not, I appreciate something new."
"I'm so tired of the same horror movies that come out every single year. If you told me that Gallows movie actually came out 3 years ago I'd believe you.After watching it I feel YMS hit most of the things and flaws I noticed too.  It was filmed great but I still found myself bored at times.I agree. I don't really get scared by horror movies, but I enjoy watching them."
"This was getting a lot of hype, so I gave it a try and actually found it really boring and I was glad when it was finally over. The main female just drove me insane. She went and sat in an open area 3-4 times and never checked behind her."
"But the movie felt slow and the monster wasn't that interesting. I cared more about the rules it was forced to follow and what it's limitations were. And the friends E reader thing. It drove me nuts along with the ambiguous time setting."
"Anyway. I didn't like the movie. Idea was interesting but execution wasn't there. I was at a screening for the film, and the director, David Robert Mitchell, was there to do Q&A after the screening. Several of these complaints were brought up, which lead him to point out how the movie takes place in a world similar to Peanuts, where the characters are and act like children all while adult supervision or presence even is almost non existent. His vision for the ambiguous time setting was to make it feel unreal, as if the world the movie takes place in is somehow different from our own."
"I in no way can do his discussion justice, however hearing him talk about his movie allowed me to see it in a way which I never would have considered on my own, and because of that I fucking LOVED the film. It deserves a rewatch. My friends and I were surprised how much we missed. this exactly!  The movie was like a dream sequence. I sort of agree, sort of don't..."
"You can't be pumped on adrenaline all the time, eventually you slip up and drop your guard and just forget to be aware of your surroundings, especially when the threat is so surreal.They did an AMA with the director a while back. A user asked the question about the fact that she sleeps on the car after driving. It was almost a sense of her giving up. The though of her falling asleep and losing to that thing made more sense. He seemed to make the movie to what you want to take away from it. Hence the ambiguity of the movie. Beautiful cinematography though. Totally see where you are coming from though. Any chance you've got a link to the AMA?I'm doing this from mobile. So hopefully this works."
"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/31suh9/it_follows_director_david_robert_mitchell_here_ama/?ref=search_posts"
"Very interesting read. Completely agree, It follows had a great soundtrack, real reminiscent of the old school horrors with their synths and such. And the Cinematography was pretty well done, I really enjoyed *Watching* this movie."
"But it was so over hyped, it had a few jump scares that were cheap, and honestly I didn't like the whole film much, especially with that ending."
"Overall its a good watch, but does not deserve as much praise as its getting. (Also what was that shell phone that girl had?)"
"As above, so below. That is a good modern day horror film. If you have not watched it, I highly recommend. To me its near perfect, except for that one silly part about 3/4 in. You'll know the bit, trust me. But the scares, and the fear in that movie was just delightful. Love it.Are you talking about the heisman scene?[AS ABOVE SO BELOW SPOILERS](#s No, the bit when he gets sucked into the car and it disappears)Girl, push. That heisman was way corny than that.Okay you have lost me, whats the heisman? Like, what is it? What terminology is this? I remember from an old thread discussing It Follows that many of the style and prop choices were made to keep you from pinpointing the time the movie was set in. So it'd feel like a surreal dream world in a way. Made the shellphone seem a little less out of place (because it kind of all was). Thought that was pretty neat.I noticed that about the film and pointed out to my wife that there was a random use of devices, scenery, costume and props. We both left feeling refreshed and glad that there seems to be a resurgence of original films starting to make a come back and that it wasn't a gore flick. I personally thought it was great and loved reading the AMA with the director about it.Just trying to figure out when It Follows takes place is a sub-plot all to itself.Takes place out of time, thought that was pretty obvious. It gave us a mix of future and past, yet nothing to indicate that it was out of reach of either."
"It tried to go for timeless, and I think it worked.Agreed. Saw it in theaters and I thought the atmosphere and music was tense and set the tone of the movie very well.The main title is my ringtone.  It's amazing.  Yet it terrifies me a little when people call late at night.Also check out High Tension if you never want to sleep again.Don't do this. The film makes no sense and is just a cheap trick in the end.You mean the rip-off of the first half of Dean Koontz's book *Intensity*?"
"Someone had to say it..Yeah, the one where you get a gigantic gaping plot hole because they felt like adding an idiotic plot twist. That one. Funny, I read some Dean Koontz books about... oh, I'd say 30 years ago.  And they were rip-offs of Peter Straub stories."
"Karma, I guess.  A lot of authors start by emulating their heroes.Absolutely love Sauna."
"Beautiful filmgore != horror"
"I would not watch most of theseJust because they are gory doesn't mean they aren't horror. Gore != horror, but it doesn't mean that horror and gore can't work well together. Some of my favourite horror movies have gore in them.Yeah, but it must have a supernatural element to it to properly qualify as horror, no? Otherwise it's just gore."
"Edit: Wow, downvotes for an opinion. Sensitive bunch of little girls, aren't you?I haven't downvoted, but no. Horror doesn't need to have a supernatural element to it whatsoever. In fact, reality based horror can be far creepier due to the it can really happen angle.I know, you're right about that. Just my opinion really.Of course a good horror movie can have gore but there's a whole crop of gore/sadistic movies (probably inspired by the Saw series) that are not really based on making people afraid but go for the cheap angle of making people afraid of what they are going to see.True, but there's plenty of gore-free horror movie that isn't scary at all and is based entirely on trying to startle the audience with lame jump scares."
"We agree lame jump scares are also cheap horror.Well that's good enough for me since I have a really hard time finding something that actually scares me anymore, so I've given up and mostly look for the ones with the best gore, comedy, or are good psychological horror thrillers. But that doesn't mean I don't like the other kinds of horror films, because if they have a great or interesting story, I'll still watch it.I haven't seen all of these but I have seen Julia's Eyes and Sauna. Neither have much gore at all. First thing I thought reading this list. So over gore horrorRight At Your Door has no gore if I remember correctly. But it might  not qualify as horror either.Any chance you can steer me clear of those ones?Excision is the only one from the list I've seen.  It's a teeny bit gory at the end, but otherwise was a pretty solid movie.  Kinda forgettable -- I didn't even remember I'd seen it until I read the synopsis.  But it was enjoyable while it lasted, though we found it more sad than scary."
"I realize this doesn't sound like much of a recommendation.  But the movie was put together well, and I don't regret watching it.  And I hate torture porn and gratuitous gore.It has some good acting, humour, gore, sex, and an unexpected serious ending, at 81 minutes runtime it's worth a try.I've only seen *Right At Your Door* and *In Fear*. Neither one has gore. I think there may have been vomit or coughing up blood, something like that, in *Right At Your Door* and there was a little blood in *In Fear*, so I wouldn't recommend either one if you are completely against seeing bodily fluids, but neither one is gory. *Right At Your Door* isn't really horror though, more like an infectious disease outbreak thriller. *In Fear* is horror. Not scare-your-pants-off horror, but horror. Is that what these films are? That's disappointing. I hadn't heard of any of them and was looking forward to some new recommended horror but I agree with you totally - Gore flicks aren't scary, they can make you uncomfortable and they can get under your skin and play on your mind for a long time but that doesn't make them horror. I put goreporn in the same category as horror movies that use jump scares. It's just lazy.I've only seen two of these, *Right At Your Door* and *In Fear*, but neither are gory. There are clearly sick people in *Right At Your Door* and there is a little blood in *In Fear*, but no gore. I can't say anything about the others because I've never heard of them. I thought it was just me being old and cranky, because my first thought was 'none of these are legit horror. They're just gore flicks.' I've nothing against them, but show me a monster or poltergeist if you're going to recommend a horror, not some dude who'll cut off your toes. Gore is not my thing, and (IMO) is not horror.Goddammit. This is what I was afraid ofI love horror but hate gore/torture. This list, it is not for me. I was searching the comments to see if anyone agreed with me, haha.  Glad to see others who think the horror genre is separate from all the goriness.Agreed. Gore isn't scary. It can be gross, and it can, if done exceptionally well, add to an already scary thing, but it is not itself scary to me."
"And as an add to that, I don't personally find serial kilers or the like scary. I know a lot of people do, and I can appreciate the horror of that more realistic scenario, but as a film, it doesn't get to me. It's just like Yeah, crazy people exist and they can do some fucked up things.To be entirely honest, I find some movies about serial killers conceptually deeply disturbing, mainly because I'm affected when I hear real-world reports of these kinds of things.  What troubles me is I see people rooting for the bad guy in these movies, which is just beyond me."
"For an example, Kidnapped sounded a lot like the Petit family murders.  Why would you make a movie celebrating that?  Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the whole thing."
"Having said that, I like Manhunter, Silence of the Lambs, and the Hannibal TV series.  Primarily, I feel we're not meant to sympathize with the bad guys in these cases, so I'm able to appreciate the psychological thriller aspects."
"Otherwise, I like atmospheric horror films.  Stuff like Alien, The Exorcist, Event Horizon, The Shining.  But in these cases, once again, I feel as though it's not celebrating depravity."
"Again, it's possible I misunderstand the whole genre.Fuck... is that what most of the list is? I was scanning the comments first just for because. I hope there's more to it...Same here, I do like horror movies but gore-based ones are just not my thing.Julia's Eyes is not gore, more psychological and a touch of the whodunnits to keep the interest."
"Highly recommended!Yeah, that screenshot was not relevant at all. It makes it look like a The Ring or The Grudge lookalike, whereas it's much more a psychological thriller.+1 for Excision. If John Waters (who is actually in the film) directed a horror film this would be it.Didn't really like the movie much at all but when I saw Waters and his mustache playing the part he was playing I had a nice chuckle.REC. I recommend REC. I won't tell you why. It's a film I watched in one of my random film session. But if you want a good horror film, REC is the definition of that.I speak Spanish and I hated most of it. It was nothing special for me. The ending was amazing though.The spanish is that bad huh?No, I meant that the story could have been easier to follow and possibly more enthralling since I didn't need to read subtitles. Instead it was disappointing, with or without subtitles.The next two are good toiHoly christ no. REC is amazing, just wonderful. Go watch it if you haven't."
"2 is really meh, like it's not good but if after watching REC you want more then it's probably worth a watch."
"3... Oh god, 3. My girlfriend and I paused the movie and had to look it up to see if was a satire or something, it was obscenely bad. I would say it was extremely disappointing but after 2 I had low expectations, it failed to meet even those. There's no way in hell I would ever put 4 on so I haven't seen it, even if I was looking for a laugh there's better things to do than waste my time with the REC franchise which should have ended with REC.Rec 3 is the one with the wedding, right? Really liked it, much more than Rec 22 was good, 3 felt completely different and I didnt enjoy it near as much as the others.I liked 4 more than 3, I didn't really like Rec 3 all that much.  Loved 2 which was pretty polarizing, a *lot* of people didn't like the direction  Balaguero took the franchise in.Didn't even know 4 is out, thank god I saw your comment.I couldn't get into REC^(2) when they began introducing supernatural elements to it. To me it worked better as a science fiction horror, when they began saying that the undead were angry spirits or whatever it just hit the wrong buttons for me."
"Oh, and avoid te American remake (quarantine) like the God damn plague.I thought Quarantine was a one of the better horror remakes since The Grudge.  Now, Quarantine 2: Terminal, avoid like the plague for sure.  Oh man, agree to disagree. I'm glad you enjoyed it, because I sure didn't! What's your main gripe with the film?  Avoid like the goddamn plague, those are some strong words.  If you take away the fact that it's basically a shot for shot remake, it's a very well done one.  The acting was solid, the production values good (probably too good for the film) and it struck a good atmosphere.  I don't want to list my petty gripes with the film, they mostly boil down to opinion anyway. You liked the things you listed, I felt otherwise."
"If you want a more analytical answer I'd recommend the YMS videos here,"
"[Part one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfjV3aemVS0) and [Part two](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukK6zF5Ol1g). I mostly agree with what the author has to say."
"Again though, I don't want to come across as attacking something you like. I hoped that what I'd said came across more as being indicative of my own dislike rather than a call for conformity. Apologies for poor phrasing.No, hey, films are subjective.  I just wanted to know your honest opinion, it doesn't bother me that you didn't like it.  Thanks for the links and response, I'll check it out.  Ok, cool. Just a heads up, that video I linked is one of the authors earlier review, and it's rough around the edges. Very opinionated and coarse, but I think he hits some good points.     Eh, I thought Quarantine 2 was a good lazy-day-got-nothin'-to-watch kinda movie. Fucking love RECJesus man, I loved this movie. I watched it at 1 in the morning for the first time, and it freaked me the hell out."
"I immediately woke up my younger brother and re-watched it with him (he's also a horror buff) and we freaked out together. Such an awesome memory.REC is super popular movie and not really in same category with this list.REC is amazing; do watch it if you haven'tIt's one of the only found footage type films where I feel the technique adds to the experience. That in and of itself almost makes it worth recommending. Totally agree. It's the Silent Hill of movies, if that makes sense. :P"
"What I think is a shame in the American version is that they picked an already famous actress. I can't be scared of something if I can watch an episode of Dexter released after the film was made. There was an added element of who the hell are these people and what is going on!? that made REC even better."
"Quarantine wasn't as bad as some people claimed, it just lacked the horror element.Starry eyes is a pretty solid film. It has some creepy elements. It can be somewhat slow imo but I enjoyed it on a lazy weekend. I can't weigh in on the others but I'm interested in seeing them. I love a good horror movie. I didn't like it honestly, would not recommend.It felt like a bad version of Rosemary's babyI thought it was a little dumb, but not a horrible movie. The ending is kinda weird.I was not expecting to like this movie, but I saw a lot of recommendations for it here on reddit and I was pleasantly surprised. Some of it was a bit hokey, but I think that added to the atmosphere of the movie. It reminded me a little of the 70's made for tv horror flicks like Race With the Devil and even a little bit of Rosemary's BabyOkay then, watching Murder Party! I've only seen a couple from your list. La Horde is good, and Secuestrados is VERY good. Edit: easier said than done, can't find it anywhere :\ Edit2: found it. God, when I'm done conquering the world I'll personally hunt down every single one of the guys who make fake video links and bury them alive. Edit3: here it is http://gorillavid.in/xknzsdd6u84q sorry for the late answer, it was early morning when I found it and I've been away all day.Mind sharing where you found it? I'm having trouble doing so.Julia's Eyes!!! Nobody ever knows this movie when I bring it up. Fair warning: it's got some logical gaps and silly moments, but when it's on, it's ON."
"The main character is going blind, and the film uses pitch-darkness and deep shadows better than almost any horror I've ever seen. Opening scene alone is worth a watch."
"At the same time, I'd struggle to classify Big Bad Wolves as horror. Same with Right At Your Door. One's almost a comedy, the other's a drama. Nothing really horror about either, except for the settings.The scene where [spoilers] (/s she is at the killers house having tea and the girl comes to help only to be killed by him was sick, the way she was killed was brutal). That was a great film I found in Ecuador. Sadly not many people have heard of it."
"*is the spoiler tag working? Its my first time using it, so let me know if I messed it up.I don't know if you guys would consider this horror but its on Netflix(last time I checked) and worth a watch. Babadook is the last horror or scary movie I saw that I left thinking about. Pretty good!I would also recommend IT FOLLOWS. Unnerving, tense, and the ongoing sense of dread you feel throughout the course of the film is effective as fuck.Babadook AKA BadonkadonkI think I am the only person who really did not like this movie and I am not a hard critic. I thought it was boring and uneventful. I did however appreciate that it wasn't the same old paranormal story that every horror movie covers. You, are not alone. After so much praise I was really disappointed, my expectations were different than what I got. It wasn't terrible but not worth the hubub. I actually found it comedic and have been doing the chant for kicks ever since I saw it. > I did however appreciate that it wasn't the same old paranormal story that every horror movie covers."
"It's kind of sad that the genre has reached a point where I find well, they tried! as high praise. But at this point even if a horror movie isn't my thing I tend to get happy just to see actual creative effort at work. I've heard good things about this. Adding to my list :DWatch it and make up your own mind, but I also heard a lot about it from this sub so I gave it a watch. Thought it was just awful.Do you watch a lot of horror films?  I know most of my family who doesn't normally like horror all loved it whereas it really didn't connect with me at all."
"Yeah, horror is by far my favourite genre. Same. Couldn't fucking stand that kidYeah, that's somewhat the point.Didn't like the movie either, but having the annoying as fuck kid makes sense, think how much he pissed you off, now think what that mum has had to put up with all his life. Might explain some of the movie."
"But aside from that, I didn't like it because it just felt like another insidious/annabelle/paranormal activity. Didn't do it for me at all.The kid is so annoying that I almost turned it off the first half, but I believe that it is fully intensional to make him almost unbearable at first.  You're supposed to feel the mothers frustration and tension, then you watch her snap and suddenly you start to feel for the child.  It reminds me of how in Punch Drunk Love how the sound track and editing really help show the confusion and anxiety the main character is going through.  Exactly.  The mother was pushed to the edge by having to deal with that kid on her own.  She was suffocating from her grief and her responsibility.  That's the whole point.Yeah, it seems that her kid was acting out because she wasn't allowing him to grieve either.  Anytime he'd bring up his father she'd snap and shut him down.  Explains his shitty behavior pretty well.Just watched it this past weekend. Really good movie.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ERHROKPFPbEI seem to be one of the only people in the world who didn't like The Babadook. Conceptually and thematically, I thought it was a good idea, but I just found its execution to be boring and I got about 12 minutes in before guessing exactly what was going to happen.I love The Babadook. It's horror but it's also very touching and I think it really takes an honest look at mental illness.I second your recommendation. I'm old and jaded when it comes to horror, but this movie had me saying What the fuck, *another* night scene already? I just got over the last one.Don't remind me of that damn movie. My boyfriend still does the creepy Babadook chant at night. (so yes, a great horror movie)Those stock sounds though. BABA DOOK! DOOK! DOOowwwK!I got chills when he it said this, so fucking creepy.[...](http://reactiongif.org/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2014/08/GIF-fuck-you-meme-Screw-you-Middle-Finger-Pointing-Finger-GIF.gif)I was so hyped for that movie and felt letdown by it. The acting was good, the production value was good but it just was not what I was expecting and that kid was insufferable."
"Definitely seen worse movies though for sure I thought the concept/metaphor was more interesting than the actual movie. It wasn't all that scary, but the real life parallels were a bit unsettling."
"I did like the scenes with the pop-up book though. Those were cool.Babadook would absolutely be considered horror.*Bring me the boy*Ok then watch Babadook. I thought it would be more of suspense. That movie took a huge turn. I like to think I can tell where a movies going but I honestly didn't expect where it went...I love seeing horror movies get praised, especially as huge horror movie buff.  That said, I'm sad I just didn't connect with this film the way other people did.I think it's because it had such an amazing plotline that fell apart."
"SPOILERS- stop reading and watch the movie if you care"
"So... the mother. She was the babadook. She was a childrens book author, who found this childrens book to cope with her depression. Which the babadook was. It was her depression."
"She then goes apeshit because her depression is totally out of control and she had the postnatal urge to kill her son because he was, indisputably, a shitbag. Like, oh my god, was I hoping the little shitbag would get murdered."
"The babadook was her externalizing her abuse of her son onto some other creature as her mind snapped trying to deal with his autism... and then, suddenly, they sort of dropped it all to make a horror movie. A film that should have ended with the monster brutally eviscerating her son only to find the blood on her hands, or her son killing the monster and realizing there was no monster, just a mother falling to pieces, that his mind was projecting this creature to cope with... any number of things."
"Then in the end they made it some tangible stephen king THE CHILDREN HAVE THE POWER TO SAVE US bullshit ending... where... they fed it worms? What? I'm sorry, is it a real thing? If it is a real thing, then what was the story behind this entire film? Why didn't you explain that she made the book? Augh, it just felt like someone re-wrote the ending to make it 'understandable' and I-Am-Legend'd the fuck out of it. Well, they hinted pretty strongly that she made the book.  They said she's a children's book author, and when she goes to the police station she has charcoal all over her hands."
"Also, the kid was such a little shit because his mother wouldn't let him talk about his dad's death.  Like how is a kid supposed to cope with something like that if his mother won't even recognize it?  I thought it was pretty great.  You end up sympathizing with both the mother and the kid at different times in the movie.  I feel like a lot of people struggle to get past the kid's obnoxiousness because its so easy to write kids off as being little shits instead of being little people with their own problems....what? Where does that movie express anywhere that she wrote the book? She's absolutely terrified and confused by it. She's not an author, she had nothing to do with the book. The Babadook was a metaphor for her grief over the loss of her husband, which became incredibly clear when it took the form of him in the basement. When she was able to conquer it, it was a metaphor for her overcoming her grief and coming to terms. The part about feeding it worms was a metaphor for the need to acknowledge and respect your grief and feelings for something you lost. And she tells the kid that he is not ready, he can face that reality when he is older. I think you need to rewatch the movie.She says in the movie that she writes children's books.> She's not an author"
"She was a children's book author. It was just quickly mentioned early in the film. Something about her being a children's book author but not writing much since her husband's death. The Babadook was a children's book."
"Also, remember when she went to the police station and noticed her hands were black? Was it ash and soot from burning the book? Or was it ink from writing it?"
"It's never explicitly said that she wrote the book. But there were definitely hints that she might have. That was the mystery for me, was the family truly being haunted be a supernatural monster or was it all just a grieving widow going crazy (with a little help from her damaged, imaginative son)? I thought they'd leave it vague, never give an answer, but the whole worm thing seemed to suggest that the Babadook was a real thing, not just a figment of her crazed mind."
"I agree with you about the larger, symbolic meaning which is apparent to the audience. But the question that still bugs me is whether the Babadook was actually a real thing in the movie-universe. That's what /u/Kinetic_Waffle was talking about. Was the Babadook a real thing? Or was it all really the mother? The question isn't about the metaphoric meaning of the movie, it's about the existence or non-existence of the monster inside the story.I'm so glad to see you bringing all of this up. I took everything you did away from the movie up until they keep the babadook in the basement (with her husband's things, clearly relating it to him for anyone who didn't understand before). How are they keeping this so obviously metaphorical being in a physical realm? It was in her head for 1/3 of the movie, rearing its ugly head at the boy for another 1/3, now suddenly at the very end it's this wounded animal you can feed with worms dug up from the backyard?"
"And I understand the path the other guys took in saying it was a metaphor for her pushing it deep down inside herself and tending to it, but I feel like for that to work properly, they need to take away many of the seemingly obvious allusions they built up throughout the movie. The ending, as it was, just left me sour and disappointed.See I feel like if they'd left it as the mom, it made a great deal of sense as a movie. Sure, you could say the ending was symbology (feeding it worms, I guess, I could read into as like.. can of worms, maybe? Rot? Disgust? It's pretty fucking obscure, I must say) but really, it just took a film with a great plot and some cool undertones and instead of a scene where she finds all the cutouts of the babadook book design in her workstation."
"I didn't like that grief manifested into some twisted monstrousity. The film was perfectly setup and beautifully executed as a, Post natal depression is this fucking horrifying, imagine a mother who doesn't love their child or form a bond with them. was such a great concept for a horror movie. Because, as someone who grew up with a mom, the idea of having her hate me? That makes me feel sick to my stomach."
"I get that there was some symbolism, but the symbolism could have been done a lot better, /u/Cons483 - it was just a bit of a cop out, really, when it could have been her and her son's imaginations twisting out of control as she lost her grip on reality, and dragged him down with her. Nah. Feeding it worms just played into the kid's understanding of monsters. What else would a gross monster eat but some creepy crawlies?"
"She kept it in the basement, along with all the fathers effects, because that's where she went to cope, let out her emotions, and try to keep her anger at her son locked away."
"The actual bowl of worms being sucked away was. I think, more of a visual thing to avoid confirming that the monster was her. Even though it pretty plainly was a combination of her externalizing the abuse she gave, and the kid rationalizing why his mom, whi he thinks loves him, would abuse and neglect him. It's not you mom, it's the monster controlling you.I'm not arguing that it didn't make sense, I just feel like it could have been done more artistically the way they handled it, or differently. The Babadook was definitely a personification of her anxiety/depression.  In the end, the can't kill it, but only manage it, keep it controlled.  At least that's my interpretation.  Being depressed myself, it's important to realize that while I am feeling good and managing it right now, it is a part of me and I need to remember that and stay vigilant and keep it in it's pen.The Bababook was a metaphor for her grief, not depression. The whole movie was about how grief is a monster in everyone's life and that it never really goes away but is managed. Hence the reason the babadook materialized into her dead husband among other things."
"If you think too hard about it then it's easy to think the plot fell apart. That kids totally not autistic. His actions are completely explained by his mother's depression reflecting on him....dude's a little bit autistic. Huh. Never even occurred to me to think of it like that. Thanks for that."
"The mother's spiral into deeper depression reminded me of the old woman in 'Requiem for a dream' and her spiral into her drug fueled 'insanity'.Mmmhmm. It wasn't a bad movie, but they just botched the end. I agree! Excellent movie until the wimpy ending.I thought for sure she would end up killing her own son and realize she was the Babadook the whole time. I'm kind of glad that didn't happen just for the sake of not being able to predict the ending. I thought the ending was still a metaphor. That she had overcome her grief and depression, but only to a degree. She had pushed it down, but when you do that it doesn't completely go away. It's better to keep it controlled (maintaining an awareness of it - feeding it) than it is to ignore it and let it turn into a monster again.Very much this. It's still a metaphor, and I think it still works. The only problem I have is when the bowl of worms gets magically pulled (and similarly, her son earlier on). It's cheesy, stupid, and doesn't fit with the the monster isn't real idea.Yeah, definitely. Also Babadook doesn't simply symbolize depression but specifically her hate and blame for her son of her husband's death."
"I sound a bit elitist when it comes to this movie but if someone complains anything about the concept I just think they didn't get it"
">I sound a bit elitist when it comes to this movie but if someone complains anything about the concept I just think they didn't get it"
"I completely agree. I enjoyed the film, though I didn't like some of the decisions that were made. I feel they went slightly overboard in how she confronted the Babadook  (the room scene) and it took me out of the action a little bit."
"The concept and its execution was pretty much spot on though. Great to see good Australian film. Yeah the babadook is a symbol for grief and the end of the movie shows that while you can suppress grief it never goes away and you're reminded of it everyday, you just can't let it overtake you.doook Doook DOOOOOOK (FUCK FUCK FUCK)I liked Excision a lot. It was unique and funny.The first time I saw Excision my reaction was Huh, that was pretty weird, interesting though."
"Then I watched it 10+ within a week of the first watch and memorized every line, every song cue and every lyric from the soundtrack. Indeed. I really like the closing credits song.I watched that movie Excision a little while ago. I was tripping kind of hard on acid and was by myself and had no idea it was a horror movie for a while when I first started watching it because it was something I just randomly came across on TV. Once I was shocked into the realization of the fact that it was not a quirky teem drama I was simply unable to switch it off because I was too involved at that point."
"Watching this movie to completion on LSD was probably the stupidest thing I have ever done and it still haunts me in the strangest ways months later. There has never been a movie that has creeped me out so badly, partly because of the acid, but partly because it is a really well crafted horror movie.  Strongly recommend it, sans psychedelics of course."
"tl;dr: Excision is good, don't watch it on acid."
"I think Excision wasn't bad..... but it wasn't worth watching again.  Came off as one of those gore for the sake of gore movies.I loved this film. I've watched it twice. The woman that stars in it (Ana McCord) is fucking incredible. She's disgusting and hilarious. Gotta put my two-cents in for Housebound."
"Surprisingly good horror comedy."
"Worth a watch.I've only seen a couple on this list, but doesn't it seem like most of them are of the torture/snuff-esque/depraved serial killer variety?"
"I guess I just prefer horror films with more supernatural and paranormal themes.I love threads like this that turn me on to horror movies I wasn't aware of.  I think I've watched every single half-decent horror movie on Netflix, as well as any half-decent horror movie to be released in the last few years.  I'd like to recommend Absentia as a lesser known movie that I really enjoyed.  The premise is that a woman's husband mysteriously disappears without a trace.  She is about to declare him legally dead, when he shows up out of the blue, almost completely catatonic with wounds all over his body.  The strangeness ramps up from there."
"Also, I enjoyed Apartment 143 which is currently on Netflix.  Kind of a paranormal activity-esque movie about a team of supernatural phenomenon investigators setting up shop in the apartment of a single dad with two kids.  I thought it had a great atmosphere and there were a few parts that I was watching through my fingers.Thanks for this list, I haven't seen most of them! I will also recommend [A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YGmTdo3vuY) if you're interested in vampire flicks. Fantastic movie! Although, I definitely wouldn't consider it a horror movie, despite being about a vampire. It definitely had more of a drama/independent feel to it, than a creepy/scary horror. Excellent movie though!This movie is like Pulp Fiction meets Let The Right One In. Very minimal in story and dialogue but just fucking BLEEDING style and atmosphere. Def a much watch.wow, a list of recommended films in which I haven't heard of a single one before."
"Good job OP!  Usually these are like Here's some horror movies you may have never seen followed by suggestions of pretty mainstream movies.Yes! Finally someone who has seen/loves Murder Party!"
"I discovered it when it the movie story I worked for got a single copy in our shop back in 2007. It's since been a Halloween tradition for my friends and me.i've seen a lot of those.  they're pretty bad.Can you give us a recommendation for what you consider good horror, so we can calibrate you?well op threw a bunch of obscure films so some I liked would be the caller, triangle, apartment 143, the tunnel, the pact, Devils pass, oculus(a little more famous), would you rather, the awakening, below, haunter, dead end, the house at the end of time, the taking of deborah logan, the den, housebound"
"most of those are on netflix streaming.OK, you pass the calibration. :)  Thanks for answering!lol no problem. I love horror films so I watch quite a few. glad you approve! The Den! Hell ya I loved that moviethe den was quite a treat. had no idea what it even was nor heard of it. figured even if it sucks it's short. I was very pleased. Which is the best paranormal one out of all those?for paranormal I'd say apartment 143, the awakening or oculus. my fave would be oculus. Oculus it is. I'm holding you personally responsible for any lack of sleep I get tonight.lol. hope you enjoy it man. keep me posted. I always like to know if my recommendations are worthwhile. Holy shit that was a fucking ride! I love how it played with the established rules of possession and mind tricks. The scariest part was not knowing whether shit was real or not. I also loved how they used modern technology in a way that didn't seem goofy or gimmicky."
"8/10 would recommend.awesome man, glad you liked it.  i really love that film.  if you want to give the writer/director another shot, he has a film called absentia as well on netflix.  it's very raw and low budget but the story is original and pretty good.  nowhere near as good as oculus but still better than a lot of other current stuff.I might check it out! Also, boy did I want to fuck that redhead Antibodies was very good! It's more or less the German version of The Silence of the Lambs.I've seen Sauna before. It was tough to track down a stream and there weren't subtitles. My Finnish is almost passable, so I got some of the dialogue. I don't remember much about the movie, but I do remember I liked it.Murder Party is amazing!  I saw it and the Florida Film Fest many years ago."
"Liked it so much that I recreated the card board knight costume for Halloweenthat year. Right at your door was a great movie."
"Not a horror movie. God bless you, human.I clicked on this expecting to see the same kind of horror movie suggestions I usually see, but I was pleasantly surprised to find I hadn't seen a single one of these films, I'll have to see if I can track them down Can vouch for Starry Eyes and Excision. In a similar vein, but not on the list - The Loved Ones.I don't know how Starry Eyes got on the hype train that it did, but that movie sucks big time!The story is just a way for the film to show off the really good makeup work done. It's a really solid body horror but if you are expecting some really deep plotline you will definitely be let down.Caption for the last one - This is gonna hurt pretty, pretty, pretty ... pretty good.Clicked for the nips, stayed for the flicksThose are stunt-nips.I thought you were kidding, but apparently [this](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB4QFjAAahUKEwj7-PyGptzGAhULWh4KHeeqBsk&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.urbandictionary.com%2Fdefine.php%3Fterm%3DStunt%2BNipple&ei=SeGlVbuwLIu0eefVmsgM&usg=AFQjCNE2SSTD5skiUREZ0lzKVOIpx2V1iw&sig2=U3tFAQON6tUdt9_iqk3Aww) is a real thingYeah, the thumbnail is pretty much YouTube-esque clickbait.Except it's an image that's actually IN the albumIt's almost as if OP chose the images in the album. Spooky.I can read imigur comments tooSurprised not to see more love for Big Bad Wolves in this thread. It's more a black comedy type drama than a straight up horror film. Pretty grisly stuff involving kids though, just a heads up."
"Definitely check it out!I can't speak to the other movies on this list, but Big Bad Wolves is phenomenal. I saw it the year it was released in chicago where the director did a Q&A, it was an awesome experience, one of the most spectacular and jaw dropping endings I've ever seen. While not the scariest movie, it's definitely worth a watch.Big Bad Wolves major thumbs up. Not so much horror as it is a Coen brothers-esque thriller. Tense, brutal, and darkly funny.I like horror, but I have a very hard time with sadism. I think I'll have to skip these.I'm a little upset no one has mentioned Grave encounters :/ I really enjoyed it.anything by Dario Argento. Why am I not surprised almost none of these movies have an average above 70% critic review. Right At Your Door, Murder Party and The Horde are not what I would really call good films. And I would only consider five of these fifteen films as horror; the rest being either Thriller or Drama."
"I feel like /u/drbatookhanxx was really trying to only show little known movies, which I can respect, but a lot of them look and review as ultimately forgettable.Murder Party is so good."
"One of my favs9. Event HorizonThank you for all of this."
"Responding to top comment, I didn't find much joy in It follows more hype than substance.The Horde is great because it stars Hercule from Dragonball Z!Umm.... I haven't seen *any* of these. And I like good horror. I clicked thinking you'd have some low quality indies or the typical unknown but everyone-actually-knows movies like The Innkeepers. But nope. Everything on your list looks really interesting. I'm going to watch as many as I can. Thanks! :DCan someone confirm that Big Bad Wolves is good... I actually have it on BluRay and have no idea how. I just haven't watched it yet.Excision is a modern horror masterpiece. Pretty solid list, even though Right At Your Door really isn't a horror movie.I was wondering why this was NSFW until I scrolled to the pokies.Only one I've seen of those is Antibodies and I liked it a lot. Are any of those films not traditional horror movies like Antibodies?If you want a horror movie that staples itself into your memory I strongly recommend Antichrist. One of the best films I've seen. Goes without saying that Shining's a classic as well. Check out"
"Inside French horror movie"
"Macabre horror movie from the makers of the Raid."
"Im not a horror fan and especially hate gore films however one movie that really sucked me in and freaked me out was Kill List."
"I didnt know it was a horror and the start drew me in to the characters so well .. then ugh, didnt sleep well that night."
"IMBD Link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1788391/I have neither seen nor heard of any of these! Where should I start?I'd like to take this opportunity to direct genre fans towards towards *giallo* films. These are Italian horror films produced from the 1960s onwards to around the end of the 1980s and have produced some of the best horror films ever. They're known for being highly dramatic, stylised and colourful, as well as being incredibly well-made. Their influence cannot be overstated."
"I'd recommend Dario Argento's films *Suspiria* and *Deep Red*, as well as Mario Bava's *Blood and Black Lace* and his son Lamberto Bava's *Demons* series."
"They're incredible. Can someone point me in the direction of a list of actual horror movie recommendations?  Murder Party looks epic. Will definitely check it out.just watched right at your door all i can say is that endingThere goes my weekend.What ever happened to monsters? I'm sure these recommendations are all good films, or at least, you enjoy them. But when did all horror movies start to revolve around some psycho tormenting someone? (I know your whole list wasn't these type of movies, but a lot are) This whole torture porn run of horror movies have killed the genre for me. I miss the monsters. People aren't anything to be afraid of, just disgusted by. Anyone able to recommend some movies with monsters and beasties that I may not have seen? Ugh these are almost all slashers. Slashers really should not be classed as horror, imo. Horror is meant to be scary.PSA: None of these are available for streaming according to canistream.it except for *The Dead Girl* on youtube linked in OP's album."
"EDIT: I don't trust canistream.it anymore. Starry Eyes, Fear, Alyce Kills, Kidnapped, and The Horde are all on Netflix (US).Starry Eyes is on Netflix (US)."
"Edit: So are In Fear, Alyce Kills, and Kidnapped. I typically recommend more classic and scifi films to my friends, so they always give me lists of horror films. I have not seen them yet, but many of them recommend:"
"- Starry Eyes"
"- The Conspiracy"
"- The Den"
"- Wolf Creek"
"- We are What we are"
"- Darkness Falls"
"I would go ahead and throw in Rec (Original) and even Grave Encounters was an entertaining time.saw darkness falls when i was like ten years old and just barley starting to get over my fear of the dark....it really fucked with me."
"im 22 and still sleep with at least a sheet over my head because of it.Thoroughly enjoyed [rec] and grave encounters.Martyrs not on this list? Not a legit list.Starry Eyes was fucking terrible. No Pontypool?Super horror fan checking in. Sees only torture porn, checking sadly out.Not horror. More torture porn and slasher. When I see horror, I think things that can't be explained...supernatural or whatever. What I saw on this list is just slasher and torture/kidnapping things who's explanations can easily be explained. Guy is crazy. Sadly, horror seems to be a catch all term these days.  The Dead Girl isn't really a horror movie, but still should be recommended. im sad that not one Asian horror movie was on here. as a long time lover of the dark side of cinema i can say that, aside from A Serbian Film, asian horror are by far the most horrific. And while i thought Excision was a great movie, im not sure id classify it as a horror movie. it was just a really bloody dark comedy.Murder Party was awfulI liked Oculus.The horde is a movie I recommend to everyone. Such a badass movie. I lover most of this movie, especially the beginning. Can you explain the ending to me though?If you have netflix I would really recommend The Babadook. I was really surprised at how invested I was in the movie the whole time and how I truly thought it was scary without them over using jump scares like most horror movies do today.Do yourself a favor and go watch American Werewolf In London if you haven't seen it.  That's a top 15.  I'm pretty sure most people have seen it. That's like asking people if they've seen JawsThat just shows your age.  Ask anyone under 25 if they've seen it.  Probably, but it is a classic and well watched.I can vouch for in fear, really liked that film. May be because I went to a free screening, not sure, but it was great in the cinema. Nice, I haven't seen a single one of these. You're doing the Lord's work.Hell of a thumbnail. ;)Next Door, I remember that movie... vaguely. I just recall my friend and I refered to it as 'That Fuck-Punch movie' , because of the abusive sex sceneThanks, I've been looking for some new ones!I'll have to check these out. I used to be a horror movie addict. I still love them but rarely watch them these days.Which ones are on Netflix? Good choice of thumbnailAnyone know off hand if any of these are available on Netflix or Amazon streaming?I saw murder party long ago. Wasn't a fan but I remember the love story in that film stuck with me. I'm sure I'll appreciate the film more now I loved the Pact.  Another really good movie I found on Netflix is Grave Encounters, really surprised me how much I liked it. Sure, all of them look solid. But which are on Netflix?FavoritedAny of these on Netflix?Nice list. I'll have to check these out.I saw starry eyes or whatever it's called, didn't really like it too much. But the ending is super weird which I loved , other than that it kinda sucks. Thank you kind sir/madam!  15 movies queued.I won a DVD copy of Next Door a few years back from a blog, it's a great movie. Reminded me of Hard Candy and The Machinist.I watched Texas Chainsaw: Beginning last night and it was awful."
"It's not on the list, but don't watch it anyway.Saving for laterHorror movies Not so much of a horror flick but if you haven't seen the Lake Placid movies, it's worth a watch. Anyone have a link to muder party? (that I don't have to pay for) It looks really good.How many of these are on Netflix?All too scary for me. I only like funny horror movies. YesI actually saw Next Door when I was a kid because it was on TV and the rating said nudity. I don't remember it being scary and there was nudity but it wasn't particularly sexy, it was definitely more of a psychological film.Now how many of these are just stupid body horror shock factor bullshit?Do any of these have NO jump scares at all?Resolution is also a great movie, its on Netflix too.Saving for later. The Horde, BTW...a truly great Zombie film. French, if I remember.If anyone was a fan of the Hunger Games films, I suggest watching the original influence for those films..."
"Battle Royale 1 & 2. Both on Netflix streaming right now."
"Way more brutal than the Hunger Games and much better! Not really Horror per se, but very violent :)Damn! Came in praying i had not seen at least one on the list. No such luck, some decent picks here though, murder party was a really fun film, Macon is great. Murder Party is great! I don't consider it horror. Kinda Comedy/Horror like Tucker and Daleish but has more of a commentary on art school and their students. Just listen to the dialogue."
"Next Door is a film I'll never forget. It has the craziest sex scene. Poughkeepsie tapes and the hilks run red are other great horror films that should be watched I have actually not seen some of these. Thanks!I gotta ask, the girl with her hose connected to her mouth, what are they feeding her...Fahrenheit 9/11I don't like horror movies where the bad guys are real people. Real people are way scarier than monsters because they are REAL. I can't be entertained by them. I'm far more entertained by supernatural horror. MThank you so much! I've been waiting for reddit to recommend me some great horrors to watch with some of my horror movie buds :D Thanks to all the folks in the comments section as well!!BumpBack at ya:"
"[Late Phases (2014)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2420756/?ref_=nv_sr_1): Grizzled war vet moves to a retirement community (which he hates), that he discovers has a small werewolf problem."

"Im a director. My son is my real star, but he's no actor lol. Great list. Love horror classicsRight at Your Door was a depressing film. Not really a horror.The first one sounds interesting, but I'm thinking it will just end in him dying just like most of these types of movies.AwesomeThat's a really decent list. All horror movies seem like popcorn flicks since I watched Begotten. That movie has genuinely changed me, you don't need jump scares for a genuinely frightening experience.I've been trying to get into horror movies, but I don't like when they rely on jump scares. I just want a good, scary, story.Rammbock and Dead Set Serious are my two favorite movies. If anyone has any suggestions let me know! I seriously search everyday for new horror movies and am constantly let down. I dislike movies that are straight up gore or that try and go for the over the top angle. Comedy horror is also awesome like Shrooms, Severed, and Doghouse. I'm pretty sure I've seen every horror movie that IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes suggested so finding new ones is always a bitch. starry eyes sucked so bad, regret wasting two hours on it :(Ill have to look for these. thanks!That thing in The Pack picture looks the scream extractor from monsters incI'll watch the one with boobsWord of warning about 'Sauna': It's very slow paced and calm. But still the best horror movie from Finland. Is no one else going to mention that there only 8 yet the title says 15?[Not a horror movie, but very dark and violent. Enjoy the fire extinguisher scene.](http://www.netflix.com/search/irr?jbv=60026141&jbp=0&jbr=0)No Resolution? It's a great slow burning creepy movie that has one of the biggest mind fucks for an ending I've ever seen. Also it's on netflix.niceSeom (The Isle), 2000, Korea."
"Nothing more to say but disturbing af.You forgot a movie called Zombeaversall of these look like awful torture movies... bleck. I hate horror like this.It's so hard to find GOOD horror among the bullshit. That you for these! Just watch Teeth, it has the best movie quote about jacking off on Easter ever. 8/8I haven't heard of any of these films, will have to give them a watchWatch Begotten and never sleep again. I've watched Murder party on a goof while me and my old high school friends had a movie night (One worked at Blockbuster back in the day)."
"It was bad...but I mean that in a way that isn't intentionally attacking the film. It was so ridiculous that it was funny. It didn't take itself seriously and I thought it really was a fun movie to watch, once and then never again."
"So make the worst junk food and gather some friends and watch Murder Party haha.Awesome, tired of the usual listsHow have I never heard of these horror movies?.These are actually not your conventional done-to-death recommendations. Impressed.CoolHoly fuck IDK if I'm just high but I started panicking and reading the first couple titles and descriptions several times because I genuinely couldn't tell if the list was satirical or if these were real movies because their plot and names sound so generic. Then I clicked on Dead Girl and fast forwarded to like 10 minutes and I still couldn't tell for a little and I wasn't sure if it was some really elaborate joke but then I figured the list was real.Commenting just to save this post I'm sick and tired of home invasion movies, but Kidnapped is just THAT ENDING.Welp no sleep tonight> Big Bad Wolves"
"seriously?! this is absolutely  not a horror film.*Murder Party* is one awful movie. Jeremy Saulnier's follow-up though, *Blue Ruin*, is one of the best, most effective suspense/thriller I've seen in a while. Highly, highly recommended over *Murder Party*.Kidnapped is the most horrifying movie out of these without actually being a horror film. The most realistic and tense depiction of a home invasion and the ending is just a complete punch in the guts. One of the darkest movies I've ever seen."
"Highly recommended.Personally, I wouldn't recommend Alyce Kills. After seeing the whole thing through, my only thoughts on it was [I don't care what happens to these people](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EightDeadlyWords). I didn't care if Alyce got away or if she got caught, because none of the characters involved were really likeable enough to care about.does anyone know where I can buy or stream Sauna?Lemme just stop you right there. In Fear is the most nothing, one note bullshit party I've seen in years. Go watch We Are Still Here. Its not a classic, but at least it didn't bore me to tears and wish for the death of the characters as much as In Fear.Thanks for the list, commenting so I can find this later!All 15 of those are shite.Have seen 3 of that list and they were all worth a go, so I'm in for the other 12. oink"
"I wanted horror!Comment so I rememberFunny Games is a great one, both the german original ('97) and the remake ('07).  Super creepy and well crafted.commenting to remember. thanks! I love  horror films so much. I've been burned by a lot of horror movie recommendations on here.  Here's hoping this list is better than the others I've seen.Right At Your Door was a surprisingly good flick given the actors and the budget. It kept you tense and made you consider some pretty deep moral dilemmas.Damn, these all sound pretty good and I've never heard of any of them."
"There goes the rest of my day...Saving this for my four days off this week!Right at Your Door was far from Horror, it was a pretty fucking terrible movie imo. The other movies on this list definitely  deserve their place though I'd love to watch all of these!Right At Your Front Door is super creepy."
"It has distance in it, which has always scared the hell out of me. The man hears on the radio that there has been a chemical bomb attack in downtown LA, and the man goes outside and sees it coming from downtown. Super creepy. Great post, with the links and trailers and all. Thumbs up!Damn, I thought Kidnapped might be a film I've been trying to track down for years but it isn't."
"About a decade ago I saw a foreign language movie where a family is taken hostage by home invaders. The bit that sticks in my mind is that towards the end one of the family members escapes and kills one of the kidnappers. Then his partner laughs, says that didn't happen and rewinds the film so he can stop the attack."
"Wish I could track it down.That's the foreign version of Funny Games. There is an American one also that is just okay. Thank you so much!"
"Surprised to see no one recommend Sinister. One of the best horror movies I have seen in years. Very unique storyline and not just all about the jumpy moments. Very tense mood and the visuals are brilliant. The face of Baghul still scares the crap out of me. Starry Eyes and In Fear are so good. Approval earned, motherfucker.NiceStarry Eyes was compelling, simply because it made me realize how desensitized I've become to death in films, these were really well done. This subgenre of Horror isn't my favorite, but I still enjoyed it. I just wanted her to drink some damn water tho.This might be late, but i generally don't like horror movies. I do, however, enjoy anime like higurashi no naku koro ni, mirai nikki, elfen lied and the like. Would any of these movies be up my alley? I don't really like most monster movies or slasher flicks, which is why I'm asking. Thanks!Thanks! My wife will be very happy about this. She loves horror movies.Oh oh http://imgur.com/4DLtAbc Some interesting movies here that I did not know about yet, thanks for this post."
"I am especially interested in the Pack, it seems like a fun blend of psycho killer and monster movies. Nice horror listA saw this horror film once where someone discovered a really old fresco of the crucifixion of Christ with a lot of people portrayed on it. They then started to see people from the painting on the streets looking a them. A person who these people stared at was about to die."
"Anyone know what is that movie? It left me scarred for life.Has anyone seen The Den? Its probobly my favorite movie now and i'm not completly sure if its horror, (I dont watch to many movies) but i completely recommend it.  Its like chatlourette or omegle gone wrong. I think it may be on netflix still that is how I saw it.I thoight excision was horrible. Not recommended.Check out a film called The Audition. It is an awesome unpleasent experiance. I may not be an aficionado of the genre, but I can recommend Sauna.so... i thought i know something about horror films, but never heard of any film on that list."
"ding ding ding.... shame shameHas anyone seen Goodnight Mommy"
"http://imdb.com/rg/an_share/title/title/tt3086442/ ? That looks pretty scary...Awesome! There's a really good comedy/horror I like called ''Stiches''."
"It's about a killer clown (think, 'It') and you would think it'll be a cheap B movie, but it is very, very well done."
"It's not up there with the exorcist or anything, but it's wprth a watch."
"Plus the clown is played by Ross Noble, a brilliant English comedian! Nice ones!"
"Next door sounds like 1408Are any of those Horror movies or just splatter gore shit?So which ones are actually worth watchingSauna is fucking amazing. It's seriously the best horror movie I've ever seen in my life.Could somebody whose seen these movies tell me which ones are 'torture' movies? I'm a big fan of slasher movies, ghost/paranormal horror movies etc. But I just can't sit through a movie where people get tortured physically. For example saw, Hostel, even the end of Django unchained where he was hung upside down and the guy was heating up a knife, I had to turn it off.How does starry eyes have only 1.5 stars in netflix?The House of the DevilAntibodies was very good! It's more or less the German version of The Silence of the Lambs.wow a list of horror films where I've only seen a couple of the films listed! Thank you very much this will save me ages of looking through different sites, reviews and youtube trailers. Wow. I haven't heard of any of these.I've seen La Horde with a group of friends, expecting a crappy French zombie b-movie."
"What we got was actually one of the few zombie movies that are actually good, and have characters you either want to keep alive or die on the spot.I'd recommend The Caller"
"It gets more and more creepier and chilling as the film goes on. A lot better than the crap in theaters nowadays. I found a few in Netflix streaming. I'm looking forward to movie date night with the girlfriend this weekend now. Thanks, OPOnly one I've seen is Starry Eyes. It's on Netflix and I can vouch that it's surprisingly pretty damn good.OK so just watched In Fear. Absolute shit. Horrible recommendation. Stupid ending. Dont waste your time.Of all of these, I've only seen In Fear, which is an excellent film by the way."
"I'll definitely be checking some of these out. Thank you for providing some genuinely leftfield and interesting suggestions.Wow, i've only seen one of these, good post OP! :)Thanks for the recommendations!Which of these are gore horror films?  I don't enjoy those at all.I wouldn't call Right at your door a horror movie.Marked for later.Tagging this one!That image for 'Murder Party reminds me of 'The Boxtrolls.'need to remember to come back to this. Save. (Movies)Commenting for later! cheeseburgersI can confirm, right at your door is really good with a great ending, and excision is plain fucked up in a good way.Right At Your Door! Great watch. Especially as it was released at the height of the dirty bomb fear. It Follows. Best horror film I've seen in years. Proof that good filmmaking still trumps huge budget gimmicks. Thanks for posting this!The ruins."
"Haven't seen it in years but I remember thinking how intense it was at the time. saved"
"I'm SO glad that I have never heard of any of these. I was expecting to see all the typical titles like The Ring, The Grudge, Hostel, Jacobs Ladder, etc., etc. Not that I don't enjoy those (some more than others, of course). I can't wait to check these out. Thanks!The only one I'd already considered was Julia's Eyes, commenting to save for later! Martyrs should definitely be on these lists. It is creepy as hell!One horror movie I never see anyone talk about is Maniac. If you've ever wanted to watch a movie about a mentally unstable serial killer *through their eyes* then you should check it out. I cannot remember ever watching a movie that was pretty much entirely first person POV."
"Elijah Wood is the killer.Great, thanks for these suggestions. I've only seen one - starry eyes, and haven't heard of the rest, so will def check them out. Always on the look out for decent horror films :) Some of the best horror I've seen are the David F. Sandberg videos [on Vimeo.](https://vimeo.com/dauid) They are only a few minutes long each but pack a lot of suspense and horror.This comment has been overwritten by an open source script."
"If you would like to do the same, feel free to PM me.Maybe it was the English voice acting, but I got like 15 minutes into Kidnapped and turned it off because it was garbage.Wow... Let me just say it is rare that a list comes up and has so many new movies to add. I am a bit skeptical to how good they are, but I will give a few of them a try."
"The only one I saw and liked was Right at your Door which was not great, but not bad either.The Babadook is another great one to be considered.  Big Bad Wolves is awesome! I love horror mixed in with good black humor. Really clever film.Ooooh dis looks gudWatching starry eyes now aaaaand let me tell you, shits cra...Sauna is arthouse bullshit. The effects are cool but that's like 30 seconds out of a boring slow ass movie.Insidious 1 and 3 should be on this listCommenting to save for later. I'm gonna watch all of these this week. .I know this thread is old and I doubt anyone will see this, but anyway... Don't waste your time with In Fear. Honestly one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. And i'm usually not very harsh when it comes to horror. It had a few good moments, but they were always ruined by having the main characters, especially female one, scream non stop. There was more screaming than actual dialogue. The characters are constantly making terrible decisions. Oh, your trying to shout something to someone outside your car but they can't hear you? Maybe open the door or window instead of just screaming at the top of your lungs. The constant screaming just got on my nerves and made me not care what happened to the main characters. There really weren't many horror elements either. If you're trying to find things on Netflix to watch around Halloween, I'd go with something else.Highly recommend the Babadook too, it's on Netflix, and scared the shit out of me.  Weird movie, though.I had someone recommend this to me the other day.  She said it was one of the most thought provoking movies she has seen.  Would you say the same?Yes, very mind bending.I wouldn't say it actually scared me so much that I couldn't sleep, but it was pretty creepy. I would've smacked the shit out the child in that movie, but I liked it nonetheless.[Martyrs??](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpDiQimK6U)I hate that film, it's so stupid and tries to be clever and fails miserably."
"It's like it was made by teenage boys.I'd personally recommend Nine Dead.The horror....Holy shit! I love Murder Party!!! I was convinced that no one else had heard of it!This is a great fucking list OP. After years of film watching I sometimes feel I've seen all the important/worthwhile horror films, but after this list I've found a couple more to watch. I'd love to put a recommendation up for Big Bad Wolves. Very entertaining.Yeezus I agreeOne movie I would happily recommend that isn't on the list, I can vouch as being good, or at the very least entertaining, is Tucker and Dale vs. Evil. I watched it thinking it would be something different than it turned out to be and it was an excellent surprise. More of a comedy, but it has horror elements and most of them are set up in an unintentional manner because of how events unfold in the film. One of my all time favorite horror movies on Netflix that is getting no love in these comments is Ravenous - [Netflix link](http://www.netflix.com/title/20559455)"

"15 Great Single Location MoviesWhat about Arsenic and Old Lace. I think there are only 2 short scenes outside of the houseI was in a stage production of that show!  Such a blast!CHAAAAAAAAAAARGE!!!My girlfriend recently introduced that movie into my life. I instantly fell in love with it! Definitely on my top ten list of favorite films. For people that like to hear strange stories about interesting people, My Dinner with Andre is really great. A lot of people I know consider it one of those movies that pretentious movie snobs try to push on other people, but for a movie that is 100% dialogue and zero action/suspense, this one is really worth a watch.And definitely worth a spot on this list It made me appreciate Community's 'My Dinner with Abed' episode so much more.Gweniffer, yeah, it's me. I can't make it. Well, tell your disappointment to suck it. I'm doing a BOTTLE EPISODE!"
"-- JeffAnother great is The Sunset Limited. Samuel L. Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones have an incredibly interesting rapport as the tension builds. Goodness that film is good.Yea I came in to this expecting to see Sunset Limited. I have no idea how it wasn't included. When I think of great single location films, that's what comes to mind.Such a great film, came across it channel surfing one day and just got sucked right in."
"Normally I have a tough time with Samuel L. Jackson because he's always just being Samuel L. Jackson but he's really great in this one and I had no problem getting into the character.He was *still* being Sammy L, but more of a Shakespeare L. Jackson To be fair, Tommy Lee Jones always plays TLJ.Some of these films really stretch the definition of a single location movie. If REC is in the list, we might as well include a movie like Die Hard, which also technically takes place in a single location. All of REC takes place inside a single, small apartment building. How many locations is a single building?"
"Edit: Your mom starts in a Fire Station.Dat edit.The cautious distinction can be made at apartment building.  It depends how many different apartments you enter, how enclosed you make everything feel."
"I haven't seen REC, just the knock off Quarantine, but it honestly didn't feel single location at all.  Rather than lock everyone in one place and focus on that, they continually entered various apartments, which had the unfortunate effect of making the building seem less claustrophobic than it could."
"Now, I realize it seems like I'm making a point against Cube by saying that, as Cube moves from room to room to room.  Cube manages to maintain that singular feeling by having the characters almost unwilling to try new rooms.  It feels claustrophobic because the entire cast tends to move together, and the individual rooms themselves are very small."
"With Quarantine (again, haven't seen REC), going into an apartment gave us another chunk of space that there could be something, sure, but it also put more space into the setting.  I started thinking as time went on Why aren't they just going into the apartments that don't have crazy people in them?  Why sit in the entrance like retards waiting for shit to go bad?."
"In Cube, that isn't an option.  There is no rescue to wait for, so the group moves between the rooms, not considering going back, only pushing forward.  By taking away the option of the previous room, and making the next room potentially deadly, Cube manages to hold a feel of claustrophobia through the whole thing."
"I hope I made my point clear and didn't just ramble.  Just wanted to add my two cents.But then you have things like The Mist, that take place in a man's house, around his house, in and around a grocery store, inside of a pharmacy, and around town. That's not really single location at all. Some really important scenes take place outside of the grocery store.Same is true of Dredd. It's a massive super-skyscraper, plus the start of the movie includes a chase scene and the Judge HQ.And in the same sense The Raid, which takes place in a apartment block isn't quite entirely in one place. At the start it jumps around a little bit. The title should be more about movies where a large majority of it is set in one place.By no definition is reservoir dogs a single location movie. There is the warehouse, the coffee shop, various streets and mr bigs' office. Good movie though. When I think of single location I think one set and at the absolute most one building. * warehouse"
"* coffee shop with the tip conversation"
"* Mr. Bigs' office"
"* street immediately after the heist"
"* car after Mr. Orange was shot"
"* Mr. Orange's apartment"
"* diner where Mr. Orange talks to his supervisor"
"* basketball court"
"* bar where Mr. Orange tells his drug story"
"* bathroom where Mr. Orange sets his story"
"I guess if you completely disregard the other nine locations, you can call it a single location film.Yeah, that one was quite a stretch.My favorite single-location TV show is Battlestar Galactica. Everything takes place in a single galaxy.Mine is Sliders. It all takes place in a single Multi-verse!I like Star Wars Episode IV because it all happens in one movie. Luis Bunuel's 'The Exterminating Angel' is another great one."
"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056732/I'm surprised that [Carnage](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1692486/) isn't on this list! That was a fantastic movie that took place in a living room.COME ON DARJEELINGJerome Bixby's *The Man from Earth* is pretty good.[IMDB Link](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0756683/)."
"It's not the type of movie I would ever think I would like, but I did.  I can't even explain why I like it.Yeah I really should have included this. Knew I'd miss a few.One of the best movies I've ever seen. Blew me away when I realized the whole thing takes place in one room....almost. There are the two-three scenes just outside the house, and the short one by the road to/from the house.This is true but really those scenes are like 3 minutes of the total running time. 99% takes placing in that one room. All dialog, all very captivating w twists and turns. So many emotions. Let's not nit pick. You could say that about 12 Angry Men, too. At the beginning they're briefly in the court room and just at the end they're walking outside of it."
"The Mist: They eventually get out of the supermarket and go cruising."
"Clerks:Dantes house and they leave for a funeral."
"Dredd: high speed pursuit. Also, the mist didn't *start* in the grocery store, it started at the guy's house before/just after the storm.Well it's all on earth.Check and mate.Sounds like the end of a dinner date. I've seen The man from earth a dozen times, I've listened to it dozens more. A very intriguing storyline (and some bad acting/dialog) that I found accidentally late one night browsing Netflix. A must see in my book."
"In real life there are lots of times I see bad acting and there is always horrible dialog. It almost helped the movie more than hurt it.I think that says a lot about a movie when it can have some bad acting, cringe-worthy scenes, questionable dialog, and still come across as one of the most profound movies I've ever seen.  Sometimes the whole is much greater than the sum of its parts.Perfectly put. The movie *does* have some bad acting and some cringeworthy dialogue, and that's in a movie that consists entirely and solely of dialogue, and I *still* love it.As I was reading the post I kept telling myself: He better not forget The Man from Earth. At least you remembered. I'm so happy you called it out....my Uncle directed the film.Your uncle is a freaking genius. This is my goto movie when I gave guests over for a mind blowing popcorn session.While he certainly did a good job, the *genius* is in the screen-play. You should ask your uncle to do an AMA.  Please tell your uncle just how much I enjoyed Man from Earth. Fantastic. I show that film to everyone. :)"
"Does he have a Paypal? Can I buy him a beer or something? LOLI sent him the links. It should make his day. He and Jerome's son were trying to make a sequel, but it had difficulty with funding. You can read about it more here:"
"http://filmschoolrejects.com/features/fund-this-film-the-man-from-earth-ii-millennium-is-the-sequel-to-the-movie-everyone-knows-but-you.phpTo be fair, as much as I love The Man From Earth, I'm not entirely sure if it's a movie I want a sequel for. Part of the beauty of that movie was that it gave a brief peek into a mystery and then left us with a sense of wonder which may well be hurt if things were to be expanded upon. I'm not particularly interested in knowing what happens to the main character after the movie, I'm just glad I got to be a fly on the wall for a brief moment."
"Don't get me wrong, it was brilliantly directed and I'd love for the director to do more films. I'd just prefer brief peeks into other wonders rather than seeing more of this particular story.Apologies, I misspoke. I think the story would be a prequel; however, I agree that anytime you try extending a philosophical story, you're gambling with story's integrity. Bug. Dir. By William Friedkin. Written by Tracey Letts. Starring Michael Shannon. Takes place entirely in a hotel room. Incredible movie. FUCK."

"purgeClerks is on this?  What about the funeral home sequence?  I don't think this one counts.  Reservoir Dogs also has the diner, Mr. Orange's apartment, various alley and street scenes, and the abandoned outdoor theater.Yeah, Reservoir Dogs isn't even close to a single-location movie. There are like 7 or 8 locations.I definitely couldn't see how Reservoir Dogs could be a single-location filmI'll never forget getting Buried from Redbox. There was a sticky note in the case that said DO NOT WATCH THIS!! THIS WAS THE WORST MOVIE IVE EVER SEEN. All caps and everything. I watched it. It was one of the most unenjoyable films I've ever seen. Unenjoyable because it is a poor movie or unenjoyable because it left you feeling bad about what was shown in the movie?Can someone explain to me why this movie is objectively poor? I really enjoy it, so I'd love to hear the flip side of the argument.I don't think it is.  Due to the premise, it's going to be one of those movies that a lot of people don't like.  The movie was well received critically, though.I saw it at the San Sebastian Film Festival with the director introducing the movie personally and explaining all the challenges that he had and how certain difficult scenes were achieved.  Maybe because of that, I enjoyed the film immensely.Apparently you're one of few that feels this way. I also enjoyed it, partly because of the restrictions the filmmakers set upon themselves. A note telling you not to watch that movie *after* you've already paid for it doesn't really help, does it?I'd have to disagree with Devil.  Although it technically is a single location film it isn't brave enough to embrace that aspect of its story and instead does everything in its power to jump to different perspectives to try and get away from its single location.  The infamous toast dropping scene for example."
"But I'm okay with Devil being there becasue you mentioned Exam which is a wonderfully underrated film.  And I did not know it was based on another film so thank you for that."
"Two more I would recommend."
"If you want something very recent Locke is in theaters now."
"And there is also The Man From Earth.I haven't seen it because everyone I know who has told me it was really lame and a waste of time."
"EDIT: I should also mention...the ending was already given away (by one of my friends) so yeah...not really interested."
"Definitely second Locke. I drove 28 miles to an independent theater to go see that and Under the Skin. Was not disappointed. Although, the drive back I was talking to [](#s my rear view mirror) the whole time.Locke was surprisingly impressive.Tom Hardy is really killing it these days. Tom hardy ah never not killed it. You seen Bronson?Go on, rub it in. That's right we dont got all day. Rub it right down my back, all down my back and my legs, and my arse, and my arse cheeks. On my arse! NOT IN MA ARSE, you facking homo, ON IT! Quickly! Quicker! Quicker! Quicker! Quicker! FUCK OFF, SIT DOWN IN THE CORNER! DON'T MOVE! CUNT.[deleted]That's some of the cringiest screenwriting and execution I've ever seen.I think it's supposed to be. In real life, if someone did that, it would be cringey. No one takes him seriously. He's supposed to be that whack job that's seen as just that."
"On the other hand, it's easy to see how it was a cheap plot point. The problem isn't the fact that the guy is cringe-worthy. The problem is the fact that the movie itself takes the idea of dropped toast being linked to satanic activity completely seriously."
"Crap like that wouldn't pass in a bad episode of SpongeBob.I feel like they had to include it because it sort of spells out the premise.Yeah - and I think there's a MUCH better way they could have done that then having some dude feign being afraid and dropping toast and saying you know how when you drop toast the wrong way it usually means the devil actually exists and is close by?You ever watch M. Knight Shymalamadingdong movies?  There's always some random bit character who explains the twist early in the movie. It's always a magical ethnic character.  wtf?"

When the twist happens it's totally transparent because the guy they arrest isn't Sutherland. It would have been better without the twist. That said, Sutherland works so well, because his voice is incredibly scary, especially in that context.I agree. Throughout the whole movie i was imagining Jack Bauer on the other end of the phoneIt was great for me because I had no idea who he was until years after I saw this movie.worth it, because dat voiceit floors me that this was directed by the guy who make the stuffTo be fair, Joel Schumacher isn't a bad director, he's just a hired gun. The studio tells him to make a campy movie to sell toys (Batman and Robin), and he does it. When he works with the right material, he's capable of great results (like his episodes of House of Cards). You should watch those episodes he directed with his commentary.  You can do that on Netflix.  Some of the things he says are a bit...amusingThere's... commentary on House of Cards?!  OMG why didn't I just realize this until now?  SO checking it out!I love phone booth. I never hear it mentioned so I always kinda assumed thats its a cruddy movie, but I re watched it and it was great fun. Maybe not profound or artistic but imo a great movie."
"Edit: Also panic room is similarly simple and fun.So basically you're a fan of Forest Whitaker?He's great. One of his best roles, IMO, was in the tv show The Shield.One of my favorites is Moon with Sam Rockwell & Kevin Spacey.A great film, Sam Rockwell really kills it. With all the recent circlejerking controversy I figured that might have been a bit of a risk. It took all my restraint not to make a Breaking Bad 'Fly' joke.> With all the recent circlejerking controversy"
"What's that? I think what he's saying is some movies (like Moon and Cube) *always* get so much praise in /r/movies.  Moon hasn't been mentioned in a while, but its definitely one that the subreddit circlejerks about."
"So OP was trying to minimize ones that Reddit would find an easy pick.It isn't just that Moon gets praised, but its always praised like its some underground unheard-of classic. So you end up having a million 10 unknown, super obscure, double-secret probation classics posts that contain Moon. Maybe because it was obscure at release, and people forget how widely it was watched on Netflix. Most people who saw it in theaters saw it at a Film Festival. IMDB back up my recollection; it maxed out at 250 screens.    That doesn't even guarantee one screen per large city, let alone towns over 100k people."
"(I also liked Rockwell in 7 Psychopaths, which is still a little obscure - same problem)*the voice of Kevin Spacey as GERTY"
"Don't want to disappoint anyone who goes to watch it. If you're disappointed by this, you're watching the wrong movie. That's the point.This movie easily could have replaced Devil on that list. Devil is not a single-location movie, and not really all that great.I'd say devil is just as single location as moon. Moon has parts on the station, in vehicles, and flashbacks on earth. [Apparently, moviegoers laughed at early trailers of Devil because of the text: From the Mind of M. Night Shyamalan](http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/m-night-shyamalan-devil-trailer-big-laughs-inception-screenings-article-1.467101)"
"Later versions of the trailer omitted the M. Night part.That happened in my theater. When the trailer came on everyone was like oh another stupid scary movie. As soon as from the mind of M Night came on there was a loud collective sigh followed by a few chuckles. I'll admit, that's why I skipped seeing it.Rope- Hitchcock Such a great film. Really adventurous to attempt telling a story in 'one single shot' let alone one location. The cuts are cleverly hidden as best can be.This was mentioned in the album descriptions, if you read them.Thank you for this."
"When I was younger, my dad went through a phase of showing me older, classic movies that I'd never seen. I put classic in quotes because I was 16 at the time, and anything pre-1980 (aside from Star Wars and Jaws) I just wasn't terribly interested in."
"My dad rented us Rope and said, Just watch. Holy damn, is Rope amazing.This is my favorite Hitchcock film and the first movie that comes to mind when single location is mentioned.The fact that it was shot using several long takes and then edited to appear as if the film was one, continuous shot is also something to marvel at."
"[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_%28film%29#Production)How about Hard Candy? I think there is one scene in the beginning at a restaurant but the rest is in the guys living room. Great Ellen Page thriller that has you constantly questioning who the protagonist is.Playing a role as a pedo sexual predator."
"Whoever looks at that script and agrees to take the part has gotta lotta balls.well, used to.This movie was draining to watch.Well, it moves from room to room, but the majority of the film takes place inside his house. And just the two actors for the most part! Love that movie.> Well, it moves from room to room..."
"If that was a disqualifier for the OP's list, almost none of the films would be on it.Whoever was behind Devil really missed out. Could've called the film 'Hellivator'.Has anyone else seen [Closet Land](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101597/)? Great film with just two characters and a single room but I don't think I've ever seen anyone mention itActually the first thing I thought of. Awesome movie, surprised to see someone mentioned it! I wish it was more well known though.Clerks, Dredd, and Reservoir Dogs all have scenes in multiple locations. I loved the movies Carnage and Tape, both single location movies about a conversation getting way out of hand.[Tape](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0275719/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) needs more attention, great movie that I never hear about. Richard Linklater, Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, what more do you need?you had me at linklater and hawke (fan of their Before.. series)[Conspiracy]( http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0266425/) is a great one too. Practically the entire film takes place around a table.I'd like to mention The Killing Room. By far one of my favorite movies.What about The Man From Earth?It's A Disaster is a classic-in-the-making for me. It'll be in my rolodex of great comedies for a long time.Absolutely underrated film! There's a new one that came out recently, *Goodbye World* that's quite similar to *Its A Disaster*, I highly recommend that as well.David Cross is so god damn funny in that movie. Everyone's forgotten about *The Room*. ;)Oh hiYou forgot Dogville with Nicole Kidman in it.[deleted]Also check out All is Lost. Yes...if I'm not mistaken, it all takes place on his boat / raft."
"Heck, there is probably less than 20 words of dialogue in the whole movie.Which of these are on Netflix?* Devil"
"* Exam"
"* It's A Disaster"
"* Pontypool"
"* Right At Your Door"
"* Clue"
"(US Netflix)God dammit! Exam was on Netflix, I literally just streamed a shitty version of that before coming to the comments section. Great movie though, I love those psychological mystery films.[Tape](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0275719/) was great too, IMO. Pontypool for the fucking win!"
"I watched that movie with my fiancee (then girlfriend) one evening at her house years ago.  The description seemed odd enough and it was on free VOD.  We were enthralled.  So much happens in such a small set.  It plays the way I want zombie movies to play.  Once the ball gets rolling the tension is CONSTANT.  You never know what's about to happen."
"Pontypool is incredible.  If you haven't watched it yet, DO SO.I watched Rec by myself at 3am in a dark corner of SeaTac waiting on my morning flight. That was both a bad decision and an awesome decision.No Breakfast Club?  Wouldn't that count?What about 12 Angry Men?It's included in the list at the end. Read the picture descriptions. The author was trying to make some lesser-known recommendations.One of the best single location movies of all12 Angry Men is 1st, BC may be 2nd.I was getting ready to be upset at the lack of 12 Angry Men until I saw the catch all at the end.Its listed at the bottom as not included because putting it on the list doesn't do anything because this list was geared as a reccomendation.It's in the list of better known single location films at the end. I agree with OP on that too, it's much more well known than the films in the main list.Can't leave out Hitchcock's *Rear Window*."
"[No Man's Land](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283509/) is a really great, single location film centred around two soldiers from opposing sides stuck in a trench during the Bosnian conflict. Amour...Oscar winning foreign language French film from a couple years ago'Single Location' is a stretch for a lot of theseGreat list! I'd also highly recommend:"
"**Das Boot**"
"**Gosford Park**"
"**Dog Day Afternoon**"
"**Rear Window**"
"**12 Angry Men**"
"All are excellent films built around one specific locationDas Boot, Rear Window, and 12 Angry Men are all mentioned, I just figured that they were so widely known there wasn't really any point in recommending them, even though I love them all. I totally forgot about Dog Day Afternoon, but that would probably fit into the same category.I thought Devil and The Exam were pretty awful. I thought Exam was absolutely excellent. Maybe the premise but the ending was just a big disappointment. There are so many ways it could of gone to be more interesting but in the end it was both slow in development and intelligence.The end was poor, the rest was good enough for me not to care about anything else during the whole thing.Yeah, I remember watching Devil and thinking it was one of the worst movies I'd ever seen.I thought the exam was fine even though the answer was really stupid but Devil was just awful. The only way of watching it is if you watch it as a comedy and even then it's just barely watchable.The Happening is a lot like that. That movie was hilarious with Mark Wahlberg. Terrible horror film, but pretty good offbeat humor film.So I'm going to spoil tag this just in case anyone cares, but I have some pretty interesting trivia about Sleuth and I guarantee it's probably not that big of a spoiler."
"[](#s So Sleuth does indeed only have two actors in it, Lawrence Oivier and Michael Caine. However in the promotions for the movie, they wanted people to think this was an ensemble piece and even had fake actors in the opening credits for roles that don't exist. This was probably due to the fact that Michael Caine pretends to be another person in the film, but I promise you it is so obvious when you see it that you'll never be duped. Well I guess Roger Ebert loved this idea so much that in his four star review of Sleuth he praises the work of Alec Cawthorne, an actor who doesn't exist, in order to fool his reading audience too.)"
"[Here's the link to what I was talking about.](http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/sleuth-1972)"
"This reminds me of something involving Se7en."
"[](#s Kevin Spacey's name was kept out of the opening credits and any promotional material for the film to not ruin who the killer is. He is also the first-billed in the ending credits.)Cool trivia. It was a real pain trying to write my Sleuth summary for this without giving away any spoilers.More trivia that is kind of well known already, there's a remake of Sleuth with Jude Law, and Michael Caine now plays the opposite part. I wonder if anyone could edit the two together so we could watch Sleuth starring young Michael Caine and aged Michael Caine?That remake is such a disappointment."
"Anyone in-thread thinking about watching Sleuth, I'd say go with the 1972 version.Rope from Hitchcock also takes place in one single location (and in real time and was filmed in a continuous shot!). I higly recommend it to anyone."
"Edit: As answers stated, it was not an actual continuous shot, just filmed to appear like it was.There are two shots or many more depending on how you look at it:"
"- You look outside (one shot) and then the camera goes inside where the story starts (second shot)"
"- They had a maximum of 10 or 15 minutes of film, or maybe it was even eight. So the action stopped when the camera passed a wall or when someone was walking in front of the camera and all you saw was the sloth of a jacket. And the next role of film started from that point on."
"Bonus:"
"- Every object in the room had a scriptbook in order to make room for the camera moving through the room, even the clouds in the sky outside changed with time."
"- They never managed managed to do more than one film role a dayDefinitely belongs on any list of the best single location films. But it was not one continuous take, it just was filmed to appear that way. Still is an absolute masterwork."
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(film)#Long_takes Also [the Man From Earth] (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0756683/), pretty great.Perhaps another for the list, recently in theaters, Locke features Tom Hardy taking calls in his car, driving to his bastard's birth. Never though talks of concrete, family, failure could be so engaging. Definitely recommend it!Luis Bunuel's masterpiece The Exterminating Angel is definitely worth a watch.Anybody remember [The Big Kahuna](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0189584/) with Kevin Spacey and Danny DeVito?127 Hours if it countsCheck the last picture/info panel. It's right under 12 Angry Men. Hmm. If Dredd counts, so does Die Hard. I don't really feel like it's single location if it's all throughout a huge huge building. Still... mostly good movies.If Dredd counts then so does Alien, The Great Escape, One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest, Dog Day Afternoon...*tape*, imho one of richard linklater's best films, takes place entirely in a motel room in real time."
"also, aside from the roadhouse scene which wasn't in the play, *who's afraid of virginia woolf* i filmed entirely at george at martha's house. i feel like i'm constantly bringing that movie up in this sub, but it's so damn good.What about Phonebooth?Devil is a crappy movie.Good list, I did not like Devil however. :/|Clue"
"| The film boasts a breakneck pace"
"fuck youWhat about Frozen? (Not the Disney one)*Devil* is considered great?I'm surprised The Man from Earth didn't make it on this list, or at least even in the honorable mentions."
"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0756683/?ref_=nm_knf_i1The Mist is such a good film. I saw it when it first came out and still till this day, I remember how creepy it was and that ending was such a tragedy it made the film memorable.I would recommend reading the source material as well. King's short story is fantastic (with a different ending too!) I also liked the film a lot.I loved that movie right up until the end. I have never rewatched it and likely never will. Fuck that ending. Not only is it soul crushingly depressing but it makes the struggles of the characters pointless. It makes the people cowering in the supermarket right. I know a lot of people love it but it seems like just a Twilight Zonish twist for the sake of having a twist.Le diner des cons!Carnage (2011) should be on this list.  3 of the 4 cast members are Oscar winners and the 4th was nominated.A bunch of these movies are not single locationsWhy is Rope not on this list?ATM starring Josh Peck was pretty good aswellA lot of movies that are adaptations from plays could fall into this category.  Wait Until Dark and Arsenic and Old Lace are some good examples of this.Clue is probably the tops for me. So awesome.Reservoir Dogs really isn't a single location film.Hard Candy with Ellen Page though[The Exterminating Angel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exterminating_Angel_(film)) should be on here.Technically the Lego movie would count, right? [Inhuman Resources](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1857842/) is a pretty cool, mostly single location, horror/thriller film. I think the story and ending was pretty interesting so if you have time, I'd say it's worth the watch :)The Man From Earth is another that is just unbelievably good.Devil (2010)"
"puh-lease!The Man From Earth (2007) - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0756683/A quick look through the comments and I failed to find any mention of The Man From Earth. The whole movie is shot in one, maybe two rooms of a house and the front yard of said house. Devil is not a great movie, nor is it single location, there is a whole subplot with other characters running around the building/streets looking for clues.Is exam worth watching? Looks pretty good. The Mist..."
"Fuck that shit. I've never had such a reaction to a movie, both mental and physical. Thomas Jane is the most under appreciated actor in Hollywood, and his ability to take roles like the one he had in this movie and make it feel so natural and right that you almost forget you're watching a movie."
"The ending, which can't even be talked about really without giving too much away, is my number one, all time, will never be forgotten scene from any movie, ever. Period. The amount of feels in that one scene equals all the feels from every Pixar film turned horrible, shoved inside of the biggest moral dilemma ever put to film."
"If you haven't seen The Mist, stop what you're doing, go to Wal-Mart or Amazon or any other video delivery service there is, find it, buy it, and watch it."
"Once done, watch it again, put it back in its case, put it on a shelf, and never watch it again."
"Seriously, stop what you're doing right now and go find this movie."
"I'll wait..."
"..."
"......"
"..........."
"See what I mean? Greatest, most horrible, most soul crushing ending ever."
"Great, freaking flick!Single location doesn't mean a town or a house even. It typically means a single room. I know there's flexibility in this definition, but that's why the following don't fit single location:"
"* Moon"
"* Gosford Park"
"* Castaway"
"* Shining"
"* Glengarry Glen Ross (this one is pretty close, though)I remember the first time I saw Pontypool, I had no idea what to expect. I'm a big zombie fan and it was totally unexpected. I absolutely loved it.Would like to see The Sunset Limited on this list. Adaption of a play, starting Samuel L. Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones. Whole film takes place with just the two characters in an apartment. Outstanding film.I would add Downfall to this list Well, not exactly. It takes place in a lot of different parts of Berlin, and some in East Prussia.Phone Booth?The Breakfast Club is niceJust wanted to point out that 'Cube' was made by one person with no crew. The Man From Earth."
"That is the right answer.[The Incident](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061814/?mode=desktop&amp;ref_=m_ft_dsk), 1967 ft. Ed McMahon and Martin Sheen."
"Ninja edit: Fixed link.[The Method](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427582/) (El Metodo) is also a fun Spanish/Argentine single-location movie.12 angry men is such a good movie[12 Angry Men](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050083/?ref_=nv_sr_1) , a classic!"
"edit: typoWhy has no one mentioned [The Interview](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120714/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_52) with Hugo Weaving?I recommend Deathtrap. The entire film takes place in one location. Without spoiling the end, the last 30 seconds, while technically a different location, is still basically the one location. 44 inch chest is an incredible ensemble film set almost entirely in one small, grotty flat. Incredible actors and superb film.I'm glad to see 12 Angry Men on the list. Fantastic movie.What about 1408?12 Angry Men is my personal favorite of what I've seen. Would Reservoir Dogs count?The mist was a horrible movie IMO. I just checked out Locke.  It was a pretty compelling performance.  One location, one actor.I refuse to believe Breakfast Club isn't better then some movies on this list.I'd add Open Water to this list. A lot of people tend to dislike it, but I found it riveting and terrifying.How does *Phonebooth* not get a shout out?12 Angry men. Old but simply amazing.I am surprised to not see Sunset Limited, Carnage or Man from Earth on this list. The Sunset Limited is a good one too.They missed:"
"-The Man from Earth"
"-The Sunset LimitedZathura is a movie that mostly takes place inside one house."
"I don't know if I would call it a *great* movie, but it has some good qualities.Panic Room takes place in Jodi Foster's panic room.My Dinner With Andre12 angry men is amazingDeath trap starring Michael Caine and Christopher Reeves is a brilliant single location movie.Sunset Limited?You forgot one of Bunuel's greatest films: the Exterminating Angel. Man from Earth? http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0756683/You forgot about: The Man From Earth"
"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0756683/?ref_=nv_sr_2This is the end? If it countsI'm also surprised The man from Earth didn't make this list"
"Sunset Limited desperately needs to be on this list...Rope should be hereBREAKFAST CLUBWhat about Phone Booth?Loved the ending to The mist :DWhat about MoonRight at your Front Door was awesome."
"I thought Man from Earth would be on here.  It's definitely a favourite of mine.I don't understand why Little Shop of Horrors isn't there.My favorite isn't on the list: Rope. But I'll definitely check out some of these that I haven't seen yet.Anybody have any convenient way I can watch Wait until Dark? Except for illegally on the internet? I'm a huge Audrey Hepburn fan.*Tape* with Ethan Hawke was pretty good.Reservoir dogs is another good oneWhy the fuck isn't Die Hard on this list?[Deathtrap](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083806/) is another excellent movie. Starring Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, and only a handful of other actors, it largely takes place in one room. It's based on a play of the same name, and the story keeps you guessing until the very end. Came here to say this.12Angry Men full movie is on TouTube. Watch it NOW. [Man from earth](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0756683/)What about RopeMan from earth is missing from that list.The 1982 version of the thing was always one of my favorites, wish it made the list.Yikes, I didnt make it far in the list and on the synopsis' before I had to find and start watching some... Starting with Exam.I actually was hoping to see The Breakfast Club12 Angry Men should have been #1, it's so good :)You forgot The DescentIf devil can make the list even though it also follows other people watching from the outside. Does that mean snakes on a plane can count as a single location movie? Man from earth and life of pie should be here. the best one hands down is closetland"
"most of the ones mentioned are not good moviesI would like to add 'The Man From Earth' to the list. Great low-budget movie.Just as a daily reminder, if your toast falls butter side down  **SATAN**The man from earth was an exceptional single location movie that had great dialog carry the film.You forgot The Man From Earth, it was a fantastic science fiction movie on a miniscule budget, I suggest everyone checks it outHow about Misery? Far better than The Mist, if you're going to look at King movies, IMO.The Perfect Host is a more recent movie that is essentially a single location film(95% of the film is set in David Hyde Pierce's house).  Excellent filmI feel like Man From Earth needs a mention here."
"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0756683/All is Lost.I feel like 1408 should be on this list. It definitely beats out Devil and the Mist. Devil is not a good movie.How about moon ?"
"http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_(film)Has anybody mentioned (it better not be mistaken for the other one) Frozen, takes place on a ski lift and damn, it is intense as fuck. Just watch it please, it is directed by Adam Green who did Hatchet and it is a good movie in my opinion.Lo is a wonderful single location movie. It just takes place in a room, even the 'flashbacks' are on a stage inside of the same room.The movie Sunshine takes place in a single location (the ship) and is definitely worth watching.The only movie I seen on this list was The Mist. I gotta say that movie just made me feel like shit. This list lost all credibility as soon as Devil was included.*The Mist* can go straight to hell. That fucking movie made me table flip and walk out of the room in the end.Find a movie called Deterrence. Worth a look"
"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0158583/?ref_=nv_sr_212 angry men?Devil isn't a single location film and it definitely isn't great. It's really terrible actually.does Dogtooth count? i think it counts. I stopped at Devil. who considers that a great movie?F--- the ending to The Mist.Phonebooth with Colin Farrell was awesome as a single location movie!Moon?[Deathtrap.] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deathtrap_(film)) Starring Michael Caine. Takes place entirely in his character's house. Is incredible.The Mist fucked me up for a solid month. That ending really just fucked with me. I came here to say that Carnage should be on this list. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1692486/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_12Doesn't have breakfast club but still include F'in M Night's devil.. I'm outSAW I ???!!!Where's Carnage?!...Devil was good?I think Carnage (2011) is quite well done as well. Christoph Waltz ist just shining; great dialogues. Also another single location movie.Another interesting movie would be Dogville by Lars Von Trier. The location is supposed to be a small Colorado town. However, instead of filming an actual town, the entire movie was shot on one empty stage lot. The different houses/streets/etc. are just indicated as lines/squares on the floor. You can check out a shot from above here, so you get an idea of the concept: http://imgur.com/Pp8GJ0W"
"IMDb:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0276919'The Kitchen' starring Laura Prepon was also very good.  It may have been taken off Netflix Streaming though.  I recommend it for a good indie movie that feels a little bit like a play.How did 12 angry men only deserve a mention at the end, but Devil got it's own picture and description?"
"Devil wasn't as bad as everyone said it was, but it was still a pretty dumb movie.Because it's so widely known there wasn't anything new to be said about it. Devil was fucking horrible. It should never be on a list for anything other than being a piece of shit film.No Hitchcock's Rope?No Breakfast Club?Doesn't The breakfast club count? Roman Polanski's - Death and the Maiden"
"Isn't entirely one location, but 90% of it happens inside a small house, and it's one of his best movies.  You should all check it out.  It's definitely better than many movies on this list.And Rear Window is where?Really? 12 Angry Men didnt make the list?The fact that you have 12 Angry Men as an afterthought, an honorable mention, is ludicrous. It delivered some of the most exhilarating performances from famous actors (Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb) and less known alike (Edward Binns, E.G. Marshall). Not only that, but the cinematography was exquisite. Those with acute eyes will notice that as the intensity within the jury room grows, the camera begins to zoom in ever so slightly, heightening the tension. The raw emotions, beautiful monologues, and powerful story make this film worthy of more than just an afterthought mention on a list of great single location movies.>There are some other single location films that are so well-known I figured there was no point including them."
"lrn2readNo love for [Rope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9dD6wNFBYU) (1948)?For real. The precision of the camera work in this movie alone should make it a candidate for this list.I love the fuck out of ExamWoah woah woah woah, you left Moon off the list?"
"[Moon (2009)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1182345/?ref_=nv_sr_3)Thanks. I've been on this site for a while now and I've never heard of Moon. Why doesn't anyone talk about it? I'll go check it out.Yes, yes he did."
"We're going for movies Reddit *hasn't* heard of with this list.DAE *Mooooooon?*DAE Requiem For a Dream le chills everytime so hard to watch?DAE think that they should show it to everyone in highschool???No love for Glengarry Glen Ross?Although it's close, I wouldn't call it single location, with the restaurant and the office.Put that quibbling down!"
"Accuracy is for closers restaurant, office, phonebooth on the street, suburban house, car outside office...Exam and It's a disaster are great. Buried and Devil suck, there's no sugarcoating it. Right at your door and Rec are meh.> Buried and Devil suck, there's no sugarcoating it."
"I've never seen Devil, but I thought Buried was pretty good, and it has an 87% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, FWIW.Would castaway be considered a single location movie, if so then thatIf some of these can be considered a single location, castaway can be, too.44 Inch Chest is also a phenomenal film set in a single location."
"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0914837/"
"I thought devil was extremely predictable so i didnt like it. I can't believe The Man From Earth is not here.That was the first film I thought of when I seen the title. Great film.No Saw?  Blasphemy![The Man From Earth](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0756683/?ref_=nv_sr_1) is another good one not on the list. The Shining should definitely be on the listthere's so many different settings in that movie though, although it takes place in a single building, each room is so differentIf you're interested in the set design, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sUIxXCCFWw), explaining how they purposely messed with the audience by creating false doorways and impossible rooms. Really interesting stuff.***Albino Alligator***, which was Kevin Spacey's directorial debut. I might be wrong, but i think The Ox-Bow Incident took place all in one location. [same time next year is also pretty great](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_Time,_Next_Year_%28film%29)Wait Until Dark was a fantastic surprise for me. Watched it once with a bunch of friends in a pitch-dark theater on a big projection. Great atmosphere, great tension, and great performances.Also, The Angel Of Death is a good one. Slashers (2001) is one of the best B-Movies I've ever seen. is exam good? it looks like something I could really get into. [**Last Train To Freo**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Train_to_Freo) is my favourite single location movie. I hear it's difficult to find outside of Australia, but it's easy enough to get online.I never see this mentioned on these lists, or indeed anywhere, but has anyone seen The Hide? Barring some pretty insubstantial and momentary flashbacks, it's all set in a birdwatching hide. One of the more intense films I've seen.pretty good list.  if you're going to add [rec] i'd also suggest the tunnel.You should watch the sunset limited."
"It's a play so it might not count on your list, but Samuel L Jackson and tommy lee jones do a great job. Any links to where I can find any of these online?"
"okApart from the handful of scenes involving the Northern Irish prison guard, *Hunger?!*Sorry on mobile, meant trivia that isn't a spoiler, didn't mean to insinuate that your fact was well known as this is the first I've heard of it and it's cool.Hitchcock's 'Rope' and 'Rear Window' and [Elevator](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1728975/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_9) could be in there.Hitchcock's 'Rope' should be in there. Excellent film, cleverly disguised to look like a single continuous shot.Agatha Christie's: Ten Little Indians, 1965?  Dunno if it's great - certainly seemed like it was rerun on television monthly for my entire childhood.Great list but my favorite is: Interview ( http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0480269/) Reading this list, I was reminded of a Swedish movie I saw what feels like eons ago. I may be mistaken about it being a single location film, as I was just a child when I saw it. I can't even remember the name of it. It basically revolved around a group of people that couldn't escape a small island. I believe it was a comedy and I believe it came out before the 90s."
"Any Swedes that can help me out with the name?Disappointed that Hitchcock's Rope isn't in there.Having 12 angry men as an honorable mention is a shame.  It is the best movie on your list by a long shot.   Alien, The Thing, and the original The Thing From Another World.I really feel that 'Funny Games' should be on this list"
"[Trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ec-70W_K77U&feature=kp)I've always said the one thing that would make Devil (2010) better is Betty White.I feel like The Shining should have definitely made this listEven though it had a weak ending, Exam is one best movies I've seen in a while.The Raid is so goodpontypool is such an underrated movie.How is The Sunshine Limited not on this list?Not yet mentioned but worth a watch:"
"Liberty Stands Still"
"Don't let the fact that it's Wesley Snipes fool you, it's not a standard action movie at all. It stretches the criteria of a 'single location' movie a little bit, but I'd say it counts.Glengarry Glen Ross. bunuel -- exterminating angelothers!!!! best film so far"
"What is #3?Where is Reservoir Dogs?TAPE WITH ETHAN HAWK cmon yallPontypool is brilliant, I love it.Would you Rather is also a great movie that predominately takes place in one area. Jeffrey Coombs is fantastic in it.I watched The Mist last night and was so blown away when it endedwhat's your definition of a single-location film? 127 Hours?The last film is called 12 angry men.Nobody's mentioned My Dinner With Andre?"
"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082783/It's going to be a bottle'' movie!"
"...Wait how does that make sense.God on Trial is also a good one. It's about a group of Jewish men from all walks of life in a concentration camp who decide to try God for breach of contract.Question, does [io9](http://io9.com/5714930/13-killer-films-that-take-place-in-just-one-room) deserve any credit for having a list first?"
"We'd be all over them if they published second. Also Strom of the century belongs here!!No Die Hard?Lost interested after starting off with Buried.I offer The Hole (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242527/) with the young lovelies Thora Birch and Kira Knightly. The vast majority takes place in an old bunker. Haha, yeah the Exam is a pretty entertaining film to get high and watch.Am I the only one in this thread that enjoyed Buried? Reynolds surprised the crap out of me with his acting, can't really understand the hate on the movie.Devil does not take place in one location. There are a few scenes before everyone gets in the elevator and there are scenes once there in of the security people trying to help them.I think a case could be made for the first Diehard since pretty much the entire movie take place in that skyscraper.The Mist... I put that on at random after seeing it on Netflix. Completely blew me away by how good it is! I won't say anymore for fear of spoiling it for people."
"Just do yourself a favour and watch it!Polish is overrated.No one has mentioned Tape starring ethan hawke and uma thurman. It takes place entirely in a hotel room.12 angry men?What about phone booth?No love for Tape? Ethan Hawker, Robert Sean Leonard, and Unable Thurman in one hotel room. Come on, guys. Although it isn't a movie, I've really enjoyed the Hulu series *The Booth at the End*. From Wikipedia:"
"> The series follows the storylines of several characters who visit a mysterious figure in the booth at the back of a diner. Each character has heard rumors that this Man is able to grant desires, provided that a task is performed. Upon receiving the task, the Man's only other demand is that the character continually update him on his or her progress. Once the task is complete, the character's desire is always fulfilled."
"The whole show takes place in the diner, and all of the characters are well acted.Exam was fantastic. But I've got one of those uncles that likes to give you stupid riddles all the time... So I guessed both the Question and Answer in the first few minutes of the movie... It was still great to see all my friends blown away when I was right. The big reveal was great.    There's also TAPE by Richard Linklater. Snowpiercer deserves a place on this list, i don't think it's been distributed stateside yet but anyone who had a chance should see itFridayIt's Austrian I believe, but that one is the best. My Dinner with Abed..."
"I mean AndreSecret Honour is an incredible one-room filmThe collector and collection are good ones. Thought the whole movie don't take place in on set majority of it does. So is that Elizabeth Olsen movie 88 minutes or whateverWords cannot describe how little I enjoyed The Mist. There was a thread on here a couple of years back where everyone was cumming all over it, but it's dire.This thread is full of good suggestions."
"Many of them have been in a list of mine as 'movies that make good use of their locations'. Oftentimes single location films coincide with whodunnit movies as well."
"* *The Innkeepers* is one I like a lot, though people's opinions on it are fairly polarized. There are actually several perhaps unintentionally hilarious moments but also some genuinely chilling ones."
"* *Feast* is another that is hilarious if you can get used to the gore."
"Some titles that are mildly related (minimalistic setting rather than single setting):"
"* *Identity*"
"* *Gosford Park*"
"* *The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo*"
"* *Whiteout*"
"* *Mindhunters*"
"* *The Haunting*"
"* *House on Haunted Hill*"
"* *Psycho*"
"If you do a search for 'whodunnit movies' you can probably find a lot more."
"Also Wes Anderson films usually have very well defined central setting. Stuff like *Darjeeling Limited*, *The Life Aquatic* and *The Grand Budapest Hotel*.how could you forget Die Hard I?I would include the incredible [The Big Kahuna](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0189584/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) in that list.  Amazing acting by Kevin Spacey and Danny de Vito.  Very memorable One Liners, and a very strong epiphany about what it means for a person to have character.  One of my favorite movies.The original Sleuth is one of my favorite movies."
"[Major spoilers trivia -](#s the entire cast was nominated for best actor)"
"Additionally, the remake in 2007 uses an entirely different script. The original film's screenplay is by Anthony Shaffer and is quite good, so I'd recommend viewing the original even if you've seen the remake.*The Mist* is indeed pretty good and underrated."
"*12 Angry* Men is the best movie you mentioned and should be in the main list. Replace Devil with 12 Angry MenDie HardThe first 'saw' movie should be on the listGreat list I see a lot of people saying what movies should or shouldn't have been on the list. I have seen a few but most I have never heard of so want to thank you giving me a list of movies to check out.My personal additions are [2LDK](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362387/) and [Aragami](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362417/).Does Dogville qualify? Panic Room with Jodie Foster was pretty good.When I saw Devil, completely reminded me of the audience reaction to M Night  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVLpim6_gqc[Tape](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0275719/?ref_=nv_sr_5)  Pretty good movie that stars only Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, and Uma Thurman in a hotel room. I don't see it get talked about much, but I feel it deserves some recognition on this list.Buried came out in 2010?  My Dinner with Andre? I don't know how Exam got on there, I think that's the worst movie I've ever watched.Just watched [Piege]( http://youtu.be/xphxjPkjL-E) and even not knowing French or having subtitles it definitely kept my attention even though he doesn't move an inch for 95% of the film. Idk if anyone has said Thais yet, but devil is the most awful piece of screenplay and all in all movie out of this list. And bad overall. Not watchable.Why in *Hitchcock's* name is Rope not included on this list?"
"The entirety of the movie is shot in one room."
"Utilizing only [10 takes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(film)#Long_takes), Mr. Hitchcock made it seamlessly appear like a maximum of 2-3 cuts were used."
"Yep, Like a fucking live play, on film."
"I thought buried was awful..Locke with Tom Hardy - dos that count?Buried was really bad. 80 percent of everything that happened in that movie is completely unbelievable.   .Great list, thanks for the recco's. Especially nice for me to see the tightly-crafted old classic *Lifeboat* given a nod. It was written by an old friend, Jo Swerling, who won a Tony and was nominated for an Oscar for other works.How could you leave out *Sydney Lumet's* **12 Angry Men** (1957)???"
"ITT: People that don't know what single location means.12 Angry Men is also a classic. I suggest the Russian version.Lots of these will be sets, not strictly shot on location. Die hard?"
"Home alone?Oh my god, Devil is so bad. My Dinner with AndreNo Saw or Panic room.... those are pretty great movies.  Saw takes place in some bathroom thingy. And panic room is in a house.NeatWhat about saw?Did people actually enjoy Buried?  Gawd  thought it was so boring.Fuck the ending of The Mist."
"Fuck."
"...Shit.The Mist was fuuucking good, surprised cloverfield isn't here.Cloverfield is not a single location movie unless you consider NYC a single location.How is Rear Window not on this list?Adding Roman Polanski's film adaptation of the play God of Carnage, simply titled *Carnage*. Stars Christoph Waltz, Jodie Foster, Kate Winslet, and John C. Reilly as two sets of parents who meet at Foster and Reilly's New York apartment to sort out a fight between their respective sons. Great performances across the board, but particularly by Waltz and Winslet. If you've got 80 minutes, it's a more than decent watch!Devil changes perspectives quite a bit, so I don't think it would count as a single location movie, or a great one for that matter.Exam was absolutely awful. There is a list of great single location movies and 12 Angry Men is listed as Other? That's madness.How did 12 Angry Men not make this list?Hitchcock's Rope is fantastic. Only two shots and they seamlessly overlap.Night of the Living Dead."
"Dawn of the Dead."
"Day of the Dead."
"Oh and also, Return of the Living Dead. =)If you want something funny for a change, I would add [Nothing](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298482/combined) to the list.Need to remember to come back.What about Funny Games?  Or Straw Dogs, the old one. I'd say both those films definitely deserve to be on the list...[Stalled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalled) is like a comedy version of Pontypool.  It's about a janitor trapped in a bathroom stall in the zombie apocalypse.I watched It's A Disaster on Netflix one night, and I was on the fence the entire time.  Couldn't decide if I liked it or not.  It was entertaining enough for me to watch the whole thing, so I guess I did.2001's Tape does it for meYou forgot the room How can you not mention Dogville by Lars von Trier in a list of single location movies !Beetlejuice is a surprising omission.i was totally preparing to bitch and complain about the lack of 12 angry men and some hitchcock films... but i read to the end."
"touche9 Dead"
"Think SAW but less gore and more mystery. It is on Netflix right now.Delicatessen is one location that stuck with me.I think [No Man's Land](http://imdb.com/rg/an_share/title/title/tt0283509) deserves some sort of mention here. If you haven't seen it, do it. Although not a movie, most of The Twilight Zone episodes are single location pieces. [Temporada de Patos(Duck Season)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407246/?ref_=nv_sr_1) deserves a shout. It mostly takes place in the living room of an apartment. Great movie.I remember The Mist having multiple locations. Then again, I knew nothing about the film when I watched it (with my family) and it seems we were in the wrong frame of mind. It came across as a terrible comedy film with a couple of funny moments but mostly rubbish. We all laughed at the end, too.Rope, motherfucker.Dogtooth is a great single location movie.   Alfred Hitchcock's Rope is another great one. Not only a single location movie, but it was also filmed as one continuous shot, the story unfolds in real time.Damn, no love for one of my favourite movies [*The Big Kahuna*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0189584/). Before *House of Cards*, probably my favourite Kevin Spacey role and I love Danny Devito."
"Definitely a must-watch in my opinion.Alfred Hitchcock's The Rope is the best one not on this list.How about Moon? Takes place on Moon.I'm really glad Buried is on this list. Unfortunately it's not one of those films you can watch again and again because of the way you're only watching to see the fate of the main character, but the journey itself is incredibly tense and remarkably well executed.You forgot Locke with Tom Hardy! Most of these films are available on Netflix Instant Watch right now."
"Thanks for refreshing my list, OP. Why is it most of these don't appear if I search by their genre lists?How do you leave out Phonebooth?!I would add Sexy Evil Genius to the list. Almost entirely shot in a bar."
"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1801096/Why do I love movies so much that take place in one location? I also love the episode The Suitcase of Mad Men because of this, and notice I like the concept in other shows and movies. Maybe it's because it gives familiarity with the room and very intense character interactions, or it sometimes kinda feels like a play. If a movie that isn't great like Devil is on the list, gotta add Compliance. The Man from Earth is missing from the list. Devil is not a good movie.  Hold the fucking phone. You did a list on single location movies and you didn't include Lo?? The main character doesn't even MOVE from a circle of candles. Amazing movie, one of my favorite.But where is Dogville?Frozen was a decent film."
"Not the Disney movie, the one that took place entirely on a ski lift.[Closet Land](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101597/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_48) with Alan RickmanResevoir Dogs"
"12 Angry MenWhat about the movie ATM? I didn't like it much but what are y'all's opinions on it? it's a bottle episode.One that is not just a single location, but a single camera shot, is [Russian Ark](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318034/).  Filmed at the Hermitage Museum, which is exceptionally beautiful, it is also a Russian history lesson showing scenes from 200 years of Russian history, with actors dressed in period clothing.  Truly a unique film.I really liked Brake. It's on Netflix too if anyone wants to watch it.Really happy to Lebanon mentioned here. I saw it a while back through the Starz premium subscription that I had at the time. Really great movie. Going to watch all of theseThe criminally undetated 44 Inch Chest is also a must see. http://imdb.com/title/tt0914837/I really liked [Lo](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1047490/). The entire movie is set in a pitch black room with simple sets and theatrical lighting popping up for each scene. Very bizarre, but very touching.Title should be 15 single location moviesBuried?  That movie was horrible. Just watched Exam.  It was good, thank you.Locke is a good candidate.Silent House is a single continuous shot in a single location.  amazing movie.Have to say I thought Buried was an awful movie. Very compelling list. I've seen a few of them and love them which makes the rest of the list even more interesting. Saving for later!ITT: people who haven't read the last caption. I really thought 127 Hours would be one of the top 15. There are cut aways and a very small parallel story line, but this movie blew my mind for having one actor stand in one location and completely manage to capture my attention.Glengarry Glen RossHow about the original Saw?  Or Thirteen Ghosts2LDK is a cool single-location Japanese movie set in a small apartment shared by two wannabe models, both waiting for a call from an agency about a job they both auditioned for. It starts of with civility towards each other, with inner-monologue voiceovers revealing their mutual loathing. From there... Well, watch the film!I randomly clicked on Exam while browsing Netflix. Brilliant movie with amazing acting. Highly recommended.Rope, now that's the dope!Can't forget MOON with Sam Rockwell(s)As a fan of battle tanks,  *Lebanon* is one of the first movies one comes across when looking for tank movies."
"Basically there are only three well known tank movies that are centered around tanks and portray the machines accurately: Lebanon, Kelly's Heroes, and The Beast. The vast majority of movies and series only features rather poor replica of the tanks they try to show, and are incredibly unrealistic in terms of their handing. Band of Brothers does quite okay though and at least had real Sherman tanks."
"Kelly's Heroes is a comedy, while The Beast plays during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, following around the Soviet crew of a T-55 tank that gets lost. Really an awesome movie to watch! It's based on a theatre play and features real T-55 tanks that were lent to the production from the Israeli forces - only the main gun installed is not entirely original.Why is Breakfast Club not on here... Pontypool is amazing, but you've already spoiled too much. Buried was the worst movie I've seen since Prometheus.Glad to see The Mist there. Probably has the most harrowing ending I have ever seen... What about Phonebooth?Would Evil Dead count?Devil made made this list? Seriously? That was a Terrible terrible movie.American Buffalo with Dustin Hoffman and Dennis Franz was surprisingly tense for a movie that takes place in a pawn shop and is about a coin.They left out 127 HoursCan't believe Phone Booth isn't on this list. > Alfred Hitchcock is the undisputed master of the single location thriller, and so many of his movies, from Rope to Rear Window to Dial M For Murder, could be listed here."
"You do mention [Rope](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040746/), while listing Lifeboat, but rope has the edge only because not only was the film made all in one location it was also all filmed in one take.Anybody here see *The Raid: Redemption*? Gotta give Stalag 17 some love.  Overall underrated with my generation.The Man from Earth. A crime not to have this gem on the list.These are all good choices though I wonder if single (or extremely limited) set would make for a more interesting list than  single location."
"Clue and Sleuth are two of my favorite films and while they do occur in a single location, both have a significant number of sets.  Sleuth has the maze garden, the den, the study, the outer door, the bedroom, the bathroom, the window...  Clue has each of the rooms (outer door, the road, kitchen, parlor, hallway, etc...)  If you excuse one scene Murder By Death also occurs in a single location, though with multiple sets."
"By contrast single set films are carried strictly by the actors and the use of the limited environment:"
"* Buried - The most extreme example I can come up with.  Ryan Reynolds had to carry the film with little physical presence, much less set."
"* The Man From Earth - a stretch to call a single set but since it was shot in a real 2 room + bath building without any set work I will stretch the definition."
"* 12 Angry Men - the isolation and the room were critical. There were a few short scenes outside the deliberation room but that is to frame the story, not tell it."
"* Rope - The single setting in and of itself was not critical in my opinion but the progression of the movie in (near) real time inside the single setting was."
"* Cube - probably the most extreme example where the single set is critical to the story itself."
"* Closet Land - fucked up film, Alan Rickman is really good at creepy."
"* Panic Room - Which truthfully I did not enjoy but it does fit.."
"Cube is in no way shape or form a good movie.No mention of Session 9? Almost the entire movie takes place at an abandon insane asylum. It was a great movie.Pontypool was a novel before it was ever a radio play or movie. Ponytpool Changes everything It's a great read!Glengarry Glen RossDie Hardsome of these really stretch the meaning of single location (Mist) and great (at least half the list)Fuck The Mist. I stayed up until 3am to watch it on TV on my first and last time seeing it."
"I remember waking up the next morning and vehemently telling everyone in the house to never watch that film ever.I think a better title might be: 15 Single Location MoviesThis is /r/movies and no one has mentioned the fantastic **Stranger by the Lake** from last year? It was praised by Cahiers du Cinema as the *number #1 movie of the year*. Brilliant, single-location film. Unbreakable tension.If you haven't seen it, ATM is a great one and it's on Netflix. Its a thriller that takes place in an ATM booth with 3 friends trapped inside by a stranger.I think 'The Rope' by A. Hitchcock should also be mentioned. Not only is it a single location film, but also a single cut film. (Well, almost, because technology then wasn't as developed and they had to cut it twice, but the transitions are so smooth you might have to play detective to locate them)"
"EDIT: SpellingFermat's Room was excellent:"
"Four mathematicians who do not know each other are invited by a mysterious host on the pretext of resolving a great enigma. The room in which they find themselves turns out to be a shrinking room that will crush them if they do not discover in time what connects them all and why someone might wish to murder them."

"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1016301/12 Angry Men should be added to this listIt's at the bottom?Yup, I'm an idiotBut the best show in single location is CommunityYou forgot Dunstin Checks InIs Buried really that great? I'm considering watching it.Elevator (2011) is another great movie."
"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1728975/Open Water gets my vote.[Go, Go Second Time Virgin](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065233/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)Pontypool and REC are both awesome, glad there on the listI always considered the first Saw as single setting but I guess it does have quite a few scenes in other places now that I think about it. Nice list OP.Interesting that most of these films could also satisfy a Single Word Title Movies list.You left the best ones on that others list at the bottom.Stephen King really approved of the Mist's ending? Most of the movie was OK, but that ending was absolutely terrible.Hey man, great article. You can tell that you know your stuff. I agree/disagree with many of the films you mentioned, but I more than that, I enjoyed reading the descriptions. You put over the movies without spoilers or overhanded opinion. Well done. How about The Matrix?Add Snowpiercer, fantastic single location movieDevil? NOPE!I couldn't even look at these seriously because Buried was the first one mentioned. That movie is literally the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. And I've seen Avatar the Last Airbender.    The Killing Room i thought was good.Pontypool actually is one of my favorite movies! Everyone's forgotten Jim Henson's, The Cube. (yes, from The Muppets)"
"It's an amazing insight into the man's mind."
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZuYkPmtS-Q"
"The Devil? Questionable choiceNo reservoir dogs? Knife in the Water is a must-watch in this category."
"An older married couple invites a young man on a day trip around the lake."
"Aside from brief driving scenes, the entire movie takes place on a small sailboat."
"Despite having only 3 characters stuffed into a space the size of a short bus, this movie will keep you on edge. It's intriguing. And there's something deeply satisfying about how it ends.I was actually expecting Source Code in here. In my opinion it goes massively underrated by many.Where is SAW!!!????Lebanon is INTENSEThis list needs Rear Window.12 angry men and phonebooth?Life of pi doesn't count ?I think [Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374546/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) qualifies for this. Beautiful movie.More posts like this please! I would also add some great Hitchcock films like rear window, dial m for murder and I guess you could call psycho one tooTape.Pontypool is interesting for most of the film but falls off big time at the end.  The final act was such a let down."
"I will say I had messed up dreams that night for some reason.Was 12 Angry Men not a single location movie? I realize you did not say the Best movies but yo mention Devil and not 12 Angry Men is a little absurd.I thought the first Saw movie would make the list. The ones after that weren't that greatNo mention for Sexy Evil Genius? Or is that one just too popular Why is Devil on this list?"
"Why is Devil on this list?Hey guys..."
"Remember the first time that you watched **Saw**?"
"Yeah, I know, the sequels were just awful, but the first one was very good, for a single location movie.The Mist is a fantastic movie.  I would almost venture to say that it is equal to or greater than the book.  Especially the ending.  It's hardcore.Did you see it in Black and White? Some big oversights here"
"Phone Booth is one of my favorite movies. Not many would agree, I think.Devil. The nerdy fellow in the gray suit and black curly hair; he's reddit's favorite curved hottie, Christina Hendrix's husband. Yeah, him. He's the one who's tapping that ass at night.I would say Compliance should be on this list as well.I enjoyed REC but I thought the last couple of minutes ruined it for me. The revelation at the end was too stupid for my liking, but apart from that it was a really tense film. Seeing Clue there makes me happy.How the hell did Rear Window not make this list"
"Edit: sorry, reading the descriptions and comments told me that it is indeed mentioned, and this is more a list of lesser known movies.Why is Suzy Hendrix lighting a match? She's blind...How in the fuck is 12 angry men a notable mention below cube? I know /r/movies is completely full of shit but COME ON. This subreddit wouldn't know cinematography if it watched the whole of the criterion collection clockwork style.After seeing this post, I opened up Netflix and watched Exam. By god, that movie is fantastic.Where is 12 Angry Men?carnage"
"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1692486/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1How in the hell is 12 Angry Men not on that list?I was with you until Devil."
"Shamala just produced it, yet his awful fingerprints are all over the thing."
"JELLY-SIDE DOWWN!!!!!!Hard Candy was very good.well, I guess I know what I'm doing tonight12 Angry Men should be on this list.Source Code?It's a crime that Richard Linklater's amazing Tape isn't mentioned anywhere on here.This Is The End?Thanks for this. Just found the next 15 movies I'm going to watch!Oh look, another person who thinks the ending of The Mist was clever, and also for some reason thinks that they have opinions that matter.August: Osage County fits here I think, since it's based on a play. It mostly takes place in a single house, but there are briefly a couple of other locations as there are in some of these films. It has a really touching story with some of the greatest acting you'll ever see."
"Also the film Dogtooth takes place in a single house. It's about a father that keeps his children inside all their lives and tells them the outside world is dangerous. It's a really interesting psychological concept that deserves further exploration.I remember the cube. That movie scared the crap out of me as a kid. I still dont understand why either. It was just so... wierd.What about the first SAW movie? Does it classify?Just watched Devil -- it's on Netflix if anyone is interested -- and I can't understand all the hate for it. It's got a very interesting premise, and watching the detective struggle to cope with the developments (and his inability to stop them) makes it very tense at times. The characters in the elevator proper come across very much as stock characters, which is a decision that has pros and cons (and is a conceit that was handled much better in Cabin in the Woods, although that film was so much better than this a comparison isn't really fair).The Killing Room is missing on that list. I didn't enjoy the movie so maybe it's for the best (can't be bothered looking up the imdb score).CharactersCan't forget Kim Ki-duk's Spring Summer Fall Winter and Spring. I would also call his The Isle a single location movie, but is less known. [Russian Ark](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318034/) definitely deserves to be on this list."
"New rule: if you can shoot the entire film in one continuous take, *it's one location*.No Telephone Booth?MoonI saw Mist one the SciFi channel while my wife and I were having a few beers one evening and looking for something stupid to watch. I flipped to Mist about a quarter of the way through, and we sat and watched it thinking it was whatever the SciFi movie of the week was. It was pretty good but holy fuck that ending was not what we were prepared for.Any time the film Clue is mentioned, I recommend [Murder by Death](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074937/).I understand it doesn't exactly take place in one room, but how is the Evil Dead not on this list? Some of these have more locations than that. Each one of those movies listed were C-/D- films at best.Can't forget Carnage! This really was an acting masterpiece with a great cast: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1692486/Lol that phonebooth wasn't mentionedI am really surprised phone booth wasn't mentioned.  That one was very suspenseful. Just commenting so I can find this again.> I don't like theater, but these movies look like they actually are a play."
"FTFYhow about Closet land with alan rickman and madeline stowe , one of my all time favorite movies"
"Moon should be on this list.GreatI'm glad you mentioned Phone Booth at the end. It brings together two of my favorite actors, and the film itself is pretty damn great!My Dinner with Andre?I don't know about anyone else but i really enjoyed 1408 with John Cusack. Majority of the film was done in a hotel room, even though there were some scenes outside of it. damn more movies to watch that i probably won't get around to :(Playing it pretty loose with the term great, huh? Some of these movies are good, some of them are just terrible movies with a gimmick.12 Angry Men?I just watched The Exam"
"Was an interesting flick, but pretty lame if anything. Fail Safe with Henry Fonda. Takes place pretty much in a bunker with Fonda as the president trying to negotiate with the Russian president out of an all-out nuclear war over the phone. The Disappearance Of Alice Creed was great.  free to watch on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61XR59hqRU0What about 'Panic Room'? Awesome movie imoGlengarry Glen Ross (1992) is very good, all set in an estate agents office and some iconic monologues."
"14 rare photographs from Return to OzThat Tik Tok costume looks like torture. Also the Wheelers still give me the jeebies and i'ma 30 year old.my little sister used to cover her eyes and say the wheelies are coming the wheelies are coming and run when they were on screen.  Still fun to make fun of her for it.  *THE GNOME KING HATES CH-CH-CHICKENS!!!!*it's no wonder Tik-Tok could barely walk!FUCK the wheelers.It was very difficult.  Michael had to hunch over and walk backwards basically blind.  He couldn't be inside for more than 20 mins max at a time and he was an amazing gymnast. The wheelers I thought were cool. But heir laughter...  Still freaks me"
"out.  And don't even get me started on Mombie when she says, Dorotheeeeee GAYYYYYLLLEEEE!I haven't seen this movie before. Now I know I will never see this movie. Yeah, this movie was scary as shit as a kid. At 32 now, I need to watch it again. I'll bet it's just as scary. #They can give you the heebie jeebies on Blu Ray soon. Disney is re releasing it. This gallery is a nightmare fuel refinery. Here come my nightmares again...Right? Isn't that why Odin created little people?"
"Seriously, fuck the Wheelers. Fuck everything about them. That giggle, the squeaking... nope nope nope nope."
"They're the reason my mom and I both flipped out when we saw Segways for the first time. Michael sundin, the actor inside, died of reported liver cancer iirc. Later it was revealed that he had aids.I imagine one bad fall could break his neckCan confirm. Also 30. Also get the jeebies remembering the wheelers.And those heads.  Fuck. A headless witch running down a hallway full of screaming, stolen severed heads. Fuckin' metal. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XjC_0lGm0E"
"The way she says her name at the 16 second mark gave me so many nightmares.Yeah where the fuck was Warwick Davis when you need him?  I think the reason they had to use a full sized person for the costume is because the legs are very far apart, and a dwarf's legs wouldn't be able to move the costume around.Seriously, how sore would that guy's back have gotten? Right?  Between the Tick Tock costume and the Wheeler costumes, it's like the production designer had something against human spines.  That subway scene in The Wiz is creepy too.The Wiz. Because it turns out we needed a black people version of nightmare fuel Oz as well. > Also the Wheelers still give me the jeebies and i'ma 30 year old."
"Way back in 2006 I wrote an article about Return to Oz and apparently put some of the first pictures of the Wheelers on the internet. Even today if you image search wheelers return to oz mine are some of the first that pop up. Weird how the search history retains that result after all these years."
"Not super relevant, but for a while a lot of my old site's traffic came from people searching for wheelers.Hey man, I just want to say I think that's legitimatly cool. but I'm not a very cool person so whether you take that as a compliment is up to you. [*beware the wheelers*](https://youtu.be/2MLVfQOknYM)How have I never seen this?nightmares forever. dorothhhhyyyyyyy gallllleeee!I remember as a little kid getting up and turning off the movie after this scene.  My Mom then asking my sister and I Are we going to finish the movie later? We just replied Please take it back! Still freaks me out and still have never finished it.Now that I'm older, I could push those fuckers over.  Even if you are a child, a stick should be able to ruin those asshole's plans.Yep, still terrifying, even twenty years later. What, [this?](http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-04/6/22/enhanced/webdr06/anigif_enhanced-9776-1428372222-13.gif)"
"They seem scary, until you imagine them trying to get dressed in the morning.dafuq did I just watchAfraid to click because I know what I'll find...Movie came out before I was born but Jesus.... was born before this movie by comparison. As in I've never seen the movie as a result of my birth date but it creeps me out as an adult. I'm aware. Just making fun of ending the sentence in but JesusOh gotcha, I'm dumb.Eh. .. every time I see something similar to this I wonder how tough they actually are if they can't even take out a little girl.[deleted]There's a cartoon version? I must watch this immediately![deleted]Holy fuck, this was a *children's movie?*"
"The 80s were filled with nightmare fuel children's movies."
"source: I grew up in the 80s and absolutely nothing fictional scares me anymoreI've never considered whether I grew out of movies being scary or just nothing can touch the fear brought on by movies like this one.  The wheelers scared the shit out of me. Yep, being a kid in the 80s you had some of the best horror ever made to watch.  You had those crazy ass 70s movies like Exorcist, Alien, Chain Saw Massacre, Jaws, etc.  Then you had greats from the 80's like The Thing, The Shining, The Evil Dead, Aliens, Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, Terminator.... yeah you get the idea."
"Edit: stuffAnd then you'd go to school and check out the Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark books from the library. Being a kid in the 80s could be very scary. Never seen this movie. That was absolutely terrifying.Even the good guys in this movie were creep factories. Jack Pumpkin Head, the Gump thing, the floating mirror girl, Tik Tok. Ick. The entire movie is pretty creepy - great flick."
"Another good creepy-ish 80s kid movie is Labyrinth (if you haven't already seen it).Labyrinth, to me, is all about David Bowie's balls. Sure, the saga of Solo-Larper-Girl-Whats-Her-Name is genuinely interesting, but once you know this movie has scenes where a bulging David Bowie plays with his balls and smirks about it, it cannot be anything else to you.A while back, one of my (female) friends dressed up as Bowie/Goblin King for Halloween.  She stuffed a huge sock in her underwear to get the crotch bulge going.  She did it to be hilarious / make the costume extra ridiculous looking, but once it was in there, it actually made her costume look pretty accurate. Fun fact: David Bowie's bulge won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Labyrinth. It also did all of his stunts. And don't forget Best Original Song for *Magic Pants*http://i.imgur.com/r6cM3qw.jpg"
"http://i.imgur.com/GMJWctN.jpgJesus Christ it's like there's a family is gerbils living down there.Looks like he's preparing for the Battle of the Bulge in both pics.Bowie's bulge was the true Goblin KingThe dark crystal I loved The Dark Crystal.but this was too much for me.This movie was ridiculous. I preferred labyrinth as well."
"This was a knock off"
"Comparable to Enders Game/Maze Runner and Hunger Games"
"EDIT: I am obviously talking about the movies not the books.  This is r/movies.Even ignoring that Ender's Game was a (pretty faithful, honestly) adaptation of a fairly beloved sci fi book, that movie had been in the works for quite some time. I remember reading about plans for it as far back as a decade ago."
"That said, the movie made me come to grips with the fact that the story just didn't appeal to adult-me as much as it did to 13-year-old me. I couldn't point out one thing about the movie that they did wrong in comparison with the book.The big change was FTL travel in order to make the ending simpler. When talking about Enders Game, surely you mean the movies and not the novels.I would hope he means maze runner and hunger games were rip-offs of ender's game and just formatted his comment terribly. That's the only way his comment makes sense.Hunger games was closer to the Arnold Schwarzenegger Running Man, thematically.It must be, or he's coming at it entirely from the perspective of someone who read none of the books of any series. Not that there's anything necessarily wrong with that, but credit where credit is due imo.If he's just talking about the movies then the comment makes sense. I loved Ender's Game the book but the movie was ... not good. How is this a knock off?  While combining elements of the 2nd and 3rd books in the series in to one movie, it is far more faithful to the books than any other OZ movie.  (Except, perversely, the Muppets Wizard of Oz)  It is very obvious that the people that made this movie loved and respected the source material.Return to oz is a god damn nightmare factory for kids. It was the scariest movie I ever saw as a young child. The movie is straight up mother fucking nightmare fuel."
"There are killer monkeys with wheels for hands, a crazy witch-queen that steals people's heads and keeps them in a great hall, and terrifying electroshock therapy."
"How anybody thought any part of that movie was kid-friendly is beyond me. I was sick and missing a day of elementary school when I saw this movie. My mom had rented it from the grocery store and thought it would be a good movie for me to watch while she did her thing around the house. Not so. It scared the shit out of me and I would not let her out of my sight for the rest of the day. I never gave her a hard time for renting shitty Disney dog movies ever again. Maybe that was her plan all along. Ahh back in the day when you could rent vhs tapes from the grocery store. yeah now all we have is redboxIn front of grocery stores...DVD rentals are still offered in grocery stores in really small towns. [The entire movie is filled with wtf.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XjC_0lGm0E)Oh god this fucking scene was the worst.  Just no.  No to that shit forever.The whole fucking thing still gives me the creeps. Yeah, it was uhh... not as... kid-friendly.. as Wizard of Oz....?Someone thought it would be a good idea to watch this movie when I was 8. Still having nightmares because of it.Dorrrothy GaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaleAll us 80's kids still get goosebumps from this movie.Those of us who have seen it.  I haven't.I grew up in the 80's and I love this film. I don't get the animosity about it.80s kid here.  I thought that move was wack, still do.  Here's a trick me and my stoned friend came up with: play Beck's *Mutations* as Faruza Balk falls into the stream early in the movie. Somehow* a lot of stuff lines up perfectly ala *Dark Side*. Remember it requires a shit ton of weed.Loved this movie when I was growing up! I grew up in the 80's, and it totally freaked me out! But I still loved it at the same time! Along with The Labyrinth, NeverEnding Story, and The Dark Crystal! Classics! Things that freaked me out:"
"- The Intro with the fact that they were gonna strap the girl down and give her an electrical torture from a machine.

"Did I forget anything?"
"Electroshock therapy was considered to be a legitimate medical practice in the past. Not evil. In addition to that it is still considered the best treatment method in some extreme cases. It has been greatly refined over the years and is still used in western medicine.I'm an 80s kids and I have zero memory of this movie. Not the name, none of the images, nothing is familiar. I feel like I'm looking at something famous from another culture.I grew up in the 90's and watched this with my grandpa after dark crystal, still love this movie more than the firstFellow 90's kid. This is the same chick from The Craft. [She turned out well, huh?](http://sprudge.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tumblr_lj9l8exTkq1qc89x3o1_500.gif)I actually met her once and she was super nice. I used to read these message boards on the shop she bought with her Craft money and I got the distinct impression that the people who ran the store (and her website) were taking advantage of her. They were pretty horrible people. I'll always remember her as Vicky from *The Waterboy* now.I'll always remember her as Edward Norton's [nazi girlfriend from American History X.](http://i.imgur.com/2kc2Jke.jpg)  I can't watch anything with Fairuza Balk without thinking of that movie.Viki Valencourt showed me her boobies and I liked them too!That girl is the DEVIL!!!The heads...They sent the little girl to a mental institution for shock therapy."
"This movie was the 80's Pan's Labyrinth.Not to be confused with the 80's [Labyrinth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvyNOg4jSRg), of course."
"Though that movie wasn't without its share of creepiness either...Dark Crystal is much more creepier.There is nothing creepy about Jareth's junkOf course not, I was obviously referring to the baby.The power of the babe?What babe?The babe with the power[I remember asking my parents to explain those scenes](http://youtu.be/ay5HmciZhXg). I remember asking for explanations to a lot of stuff in that film. [Oh jesus christ this movie is terrifying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=47&v=9T4BnNq5rsY).Sarcasm?Sheeeeeeeeeeeesh I clicked that not expecting it to be AS creepy as it was when I was younger but it gave me chills just the sameEasily one of the scariest films I've ever seen. It was just so disturbing and really played with so many typical childhood fears. I mean, those damn wheelers... Hat's off to them for it!I never understood that. I mean it had its scary part (the psych ward) but it never made me cry or run from the room when I saw it as a child. I loved this movie *as a kid.* (Still love it now, just illustrating that it never scared me at all and I really don't understand the hate/ fear of it.)"
"The wheelers are bad guys, they're meant to look funny. I don't understand why they haunt so many people."
"Here's the part that will make you scratch your head though."
"I absolutely **loathe** scary movies and will not watch them."
"The two I have watched in my thirty-some-odd years are Childs Play and Event Horizon, and I was duped into both. I had to stop watching The Walking Dead because it was too much for me.The Wheelers scared the hell out of me as a kid. Not the psych ward stuff."
"As a kid, the Wheelers were freaks that chased them and made crazy noises. The psych ward was just boring conversations.I think it's because those are distinctly two different types of scares. The things that really get me are the *unsettling* scares. They don't belong, and your brain is initially unsure of how to process them. It's like the reason that strange figures emerging slowly or erratically from around a corner can instill an immense sense of terror. My wife is terrified of white noise/static on televisions (probably a lot to do with Poltergeist, as well), number stations, and old robots, for reasons like this."
"Remember that witch video that was on reddit the other day? With the old lady hobbling towards the motorcycle? It was her motions that scares most people. She appeared mostly human, but she moved erratically, and she hunched strangely. It was just.. off."
"I love that kind of stuff - hell, I thrive on it, it's absolutely my favorite kind of horror - however I can't imagine myself actually making it through that scene as a kid.What video? Link please?[Here ya go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2TSStrwgg8)"
"And here's the most recent reddit post I found with it: http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/32amsr/guys_in_mexico_see_a_witch/Is it less creepy with sound?No :(The mental institution part made me scared and confused as a child... then the severed head stuff really did it for me. I later read somewhere that this movie was used to brainwash people.Can you elaborate on the brainwashing theory?I'm pretty sure they showed this movie to my class in first grade. I distinctly remember the wheelers people are talking about. I also remember asking my parents about events in the movie several years later because I couldnt remember the name of it and they looked at me like I was crazy and vehemently claimed that there was no such movie... It has been about 15 years since then and I am only just now learning that this movie actually did exist. I don't kknow what to believe anymore."
"Tl;Dr - It can be pretty good at fucking up your mind. I had a similar experience with a creepy Dr. Seuss-penned film called The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T (http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_5,000_Fingers_of_Dr._T). I used to think it was a bad dream I'd had repeatedly as a child becuz the memory was so vivid. I was strangely relieved as an adult to discover it was real, but this was a seriously scary movie for a child to watch!Man I was the same way with the opening scene of Octopussy. For the longest time i had memories of Ronald McDonald getting chased down and murdered. I assumed it was a dream I had once and still remembered then one day I'm watching TV and boom it was my fucking dream, it was real! Except it wasn't Ronald McDonald.Well at least you can now believe that your parents aren't always right.I'm gonna need another bowl.What the fuck did I just watchI saw this movie as a little kid when it came out in the theaters. Now I understand why my brain is messed up.God ugh this movie still freaks me out!!!It was scary as a kid, it's probably still scary as an adult. I imagine watching this movie on hallucinogenics would fuck your world up. I honestly prefer it over the original haven't seen either in years but this one is so trippy and fucked upI swear this film was either meant for adults or created for the sole purpose of scarring us kids for life.I don't think children should be coddled. Obviously there should be limits but kids should be exposed to a truly diverse number of thoughts and concepts. Including ideas that are frightening. Kids who are excessively protected grow up to be shallow and self absorbed."
"Push 'em out of the nest I say. If a couple don't make it back you can always squeeze out another. ;DJust re-watched Time Bandits too... the END of the movie is the little boy's parents suddenly dying when they touch the broken shard of pure evil. They just die suddenly for no reason, Sean Connery drives off laughing on a fire truck, and then the credits roll."
"This, too, was a kid's movie by 80's standards.Mom! Dad!  No!!  Don't touch it!!  It's EEEVVIIIILLLL!!!"
"...-TOUCH-"
"I love that movie so much!Anyone remember The Dark Crystal? Fuck that creepy shit.Strangely, given I was probably at its target age for the time, this is literally the first time I've ever heard of the movie. Bizarre. Because the forces of good have tried to shield you from this darkness. But it found a way to reach you. Blame reddit.My three year old likes this movie. The only part that scares her is when Mombi stands up with no head and all the heads call out Dorothy's name."
"I think you all get scared too easily. It's got a creepy/weird/scary vibe... but scarred for life?Having seen this imgur album, I decided tonight I'll watch Return to OZ with my 4 and 10 year olds.  I'm sure they haven't seen it yet.I just watched this with my 5 and 8 year olds and they loved it.  Yards better than The Wiz IMOThey're straight up preparing to electrocute and torture a little girl in an insane asylum during a thunderstorm...and that's in the real world. It's definitely a very scary child-in-peril kind of movie that they couldn't get away with nowadays.I wish them luck.  It's a great but twisted little movie that will give them nightmares and build character.-Ron Swansonwhynotboth.jpgA lot of kid movies from the 70's and 80's were like that.  Watership Down, Something Wicked This Way Comes, Willy Wonka (Tunnel Scene), etc.The Peanut Butter Solution.holy shit Watership Down."
"\*shivers\*The dark crystal,  the brave little toaster.  It makes you wonder what the directors were thinking.Don't forget that fucking Alice in Wonderland with the Dragon. Right up there with the wheelers for me. Are we going to talk about the Dark Crystal? That movie totally deserves to be on that list. *The Last Unicorn*.We just had a Bad Movie Night with The Last Unicorn.  Such an odd movie.  And you don't see many children's movies with a triple saggy tits harpy.See but I think it should be like that. Look at the original Grimm's fairy tales and how dark they are. It teaches children about scary themes in a safe way, so that if or when the child is faced with a scary situation, they don't just fall to the floor, curl up into a ball, and start crying."
"Everything for kids these days is way too cute and cuddly and safe. This is part of why western society is getting softer and more apathetic about things.What about [Unico](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bxdHiJinJo)? It was an anime movie that they used to play on the Disney channel in the 80s. I never hear other people talking about it, and it took me forever to remember the name... but it was the stuff of nightmares.So glad someone else remembers Watership Down. Loved the book, thought the movie was freaking awesome.How about the [the army of the dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWAq4w1h--M) from the Disney Movie 1985 [Black Cauldron](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0a/The_Black_Cauldron_poster.jpg)"
"It was cut 12 minutes and still it was the first Disney animated film to receive a PG rating...Man, Something Wicked This Way Comes.  I was obsessed with that movie, I watched it repeatedly, even though it scared the shit out of me as a kid.They didn't really try to protect kids from things like that back then.  Poltergeist was rated PG.  A guy pulls his own face off in that movie, and a kid is terrorized by an evil clown doll before being eaten by a tree.Poltergeist was PG?!?! Fuck.Yeah.  But it's worth explaining that it was during an era when PG-13 didn't exist.  There was G, PG, R, and X."
"So in those days, effectively, kids movies were rated G, adult-only movies were R, porn was rated X.  Anything in between G and R was PG, which was to say, Parents, this might or might not be OK for someone under 18.  We leave it to you to decide whether to let your kids see it.  That's what it means when they say, Parental Guidance suggested."
"There were PG movies with quite a bit of violence and even nudity.  Then in the 80s, people started to feel that there should be something in between PG and R, to let parents know, Parents, this might or might not be OK for someone under 18.  We leave it to you to decide whether to let your kids see it.  **But this probably isn't OK for your 5 year-old.**  People cite Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and Gremlins as the movies that triggered this, but I think there were plenty of movies that contributed, including Poltergeist and Jaws.Thanks! TIL...I remember watching that too when I was 6 or 7. The girl gets killed by her braces and skeletons in the pool. Haha. Such a great children's movie.I think it's not just skeletons, but rotting corpses.i watched voltron the movie a few months back... trying to get my 6 year old into some of my childhood movies...  had to turn it off because it was waaaay more jacked up that i rememberedSure, the Willy Wonka tunnel scene was terrifying as a kid, but even then it was my favorite scene in the film. I think I just really liked Gene Wilder's performance.Something Wicked This Way Comes was so freaking creepy. The book? Meh. One of the rare times I've thought the movie was better.I used to love Watership Down, I would cry for half the movie but insist on watching it over and over again... I can't watch it now because it is too intense. Despite the rabbits, and the animation, I wouldn't call *Watership Down* a kid's movie, or book. Round the world and home again! That's the sailors way!\"
"Edit: Yes the danger must be growing for the rowers keep on rowing, and THEY'RE CERTAINLY NOT SHOWING ANY SIGNS THAT THEY ARE SLOOOWING. OOOOIIIIAAAAAAAAAAAAHWatership down is one of only 2 films to ever give me nightmares. That and Dumbo. The warren gassing scene and the elephant's on parade scenes respectively.>Something Wicked This Way Comes"
"lol"
"https://burrellosubmarinemovies.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/something-wicked-this-way-comes-5.jpgChitty Chitty Bang Bang was terrifying as a kid The terrifying part was the Child Catcher, which I learned years later was added by Roald Dahl in his screenplay. He wasn't in Ian Fleming's book (which I haven't read).I'm still terrified of the Child Catcher. The Black Cauldron fucked my shit up, but I was four, so there you go.What was with the dark fantasy kids films like that and the Last Unicorn??I loved the Last Unicorn! Never saw it as dark though. There were suspenseful moments but I never saw it as dark. Tbf though, I was  really young when I watched it. I might watch it now and be like WTF?!"
"EDIT: Changed going to young.[deleted]Lmao! I certainly don't scare easily. Even as a kid.Yeah, go rewatch it. Dark as hell with the gypsy lady with the chimera animals in cages and stuff. It feels like a different movie when you watch it as an adult. I guess the red bull really freaked me outOk, I don't remember a red bull, so maybe my mind repressed the scary parts. Will try to watch it later today.It's this guy http://calitreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/lastunicorn4qk9.jpg so you probably did repress that part lolOh him. Yeah I remember him. Not much, just that he was there. Will try to watch it and see if it is scarier in context."
"edit: having trouble finding it online. :(You might try primewire for streaming Dude. There was a [scary vulture with three huge hanging breasts] (http://imgur.com/qAnUclC)."
"But it is a great movie and I love it.Wow. I *really* need to watch it again.Then you had depressing movies like the Neverending Story where his beloved horse drowns and the Land Before Time where ~~Ducky's~~ Littlefoot's mom dies :'(Neverending Story had some freaky stuff in it to.  It's been awhile but wasn't there a wolf monster thing?You mean this dude? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sEZmMeH96QUgh come on man. It was Littlefoot's mom that died.Littlefinger's mom died too.oops it's been so long I can't rememberYeah, the little girl who voiced Ducky was killed by her father in real life. Fuck. I wish I'd never read your comment. I just looked at her wiki page and I'm damn near tears. That's heart wrenching. God damnit.That's awful! Editing to add that it is in fact one of the most heart wrenching stories of abuse ever. That's a bummer.It's inevitable; every time Land Before Time is mentioned on Reddit, this little fact is brought up.  Every.  Time.I know, and I hate to be that person, but they did mention Ducky, parents, and death. I just connected the dots. Nah, I don't mind.  It's rather amusing.The Secret of NIMH. In The Last Unicorn, The Red Bull chasing the unicorns to the sea scared the crap out of me.Watcher in the Woods.Fuck you, the Secret of NIMH is awesome."
"Bluth 4 lyfeSecret of NIMH remains one of my favorite cartoons.  Yes, the owl was scary for a 5 year old, but not enough to give me nightmares."
"Return to Oz...  yeah.  No thanks.  Oh dude, that freakin' OWL.Definitely not [the worst of all owls during my childhood](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpcff9iEaB1r0oxlvo1_500.png).I swear they made No the default just to punish people for trying to skip through it.Fun fact: The wheelers were some of the same puppeteers as seen in The Dark Crystal as Landstriders. Why were 80's movies so full of puppets?Because they are awesome!"
"You can hear Toby Froud (baby from the Labyrinth) talk about on of the landstriders / wheelers on his episode of my Puppeteer / Puppetry podcast www.GettingFeltUpPodcast.com Haha, what a great name for a podcast!  Subscribing immediately. :)I'd suggest starting with Kirk Thatcher, Noel MacNeal's First Episode, Tyler Bunch, & Toby Froud, Aymee Garcia & Lara MacLean! Some fan favorites."
"Thanks for subscribing! Cheers!Because CGI was prohibitively expensive at the time.  Also puppets are fucking rad. And when it came to puppets, the man you wanted was Jim Henson.I feel the same about miniatures.  Seeing the miniature work in Moon made me very happy!Mostly because they are rad."
"I was really hoping that SyFy's Jim Henson's Creature Shop Challenge would usher in a few more puppet projects popping up, but sadly that doesn't seem to be the case and that bums me out, so much.Honestly, I wish we would get more puppets in modern movies instead of CGI.  CGI is overused, it should only be used in situations where something absolutely can't be done feasibly any other way.  Instead, it's used to cut corners.what an original and brave comment you have contributed to /r/movies. thank you for keeping the ideas presented here from getting stale.I think someday film historians will recognize that CGI killed the art of film making just as much as sound did after the silent era. There's nothing interesting or compelling about digitized perfection. Maybe it was interesting to move a camera impossibly through a scene while dozens of objects whizz by impossibly close, but it's gotten old.I'm not sure what you mean by sound killing film making... Some films had orchestras playing during the show and the others were nothing but glorified flip books before sound. Sound has allowed for nearly every story told in cinema since it merged with moving pictures and we would be without entire genres of film if it weren't for sound. We'd be without the famous movie monologues and quotes. And we'd miss the opportunities to express subtle emotion or ideas that sound affords us. I mean, people literally talked to one another and shouted at the screen during the course of silent movies. Sound made people shut up and pay close attention, lest the miss something important. As Robert Sklarr said, talking audiences for silent pictures became a silent audience for talking pictures."
"Sound is also a lot like CGI in a couple of ways. Of course there were critics when it was a new technology. Makers of silent pictures didn't think talking pictures would ever overtake them, and for a short while it struggled to but around 1926 *The Jazz Singer* successfully used dialogue on it's sound track and changed the game forever, even winning a special Academy Award a year or so later. Sound and CGI are also similar in that it will improve. Just as the origins of sound in cinema were a little primitive and cheeky, so has been CGI. Even though we think CGI is an impressive technology here in the 21st century and it's capabilities seem to be being maximized by those who utilize it, it's still very young and improving rapidly. At some point in the future CGI will be as much a part of story telling in film as sound is."
"All this being said, I prefer to watch and make dialogue heavy films with little or no CGI. I prefer celluloid and romanticize the physical labor that was required to make earlier films. But I also think that examples in the history of filmmaking makes it difficult for me to resist progress entirely.I'm not exactly sure how the addition of sound in films killed it as an art. If anything, it added a new dimension to films. Instead of some piano player for music in the theater, the film makers could have singing and instruments in their films. Alfred Hitchcock's *Psycho* would not be a modern classic without the violins screeches. Harpo Marx certainly would not be as famous if the Silent era had continued. Moving forward, actual sound effects became possible to do, adding suspense or comedic humor."
"CGI is just another tool that allows filmmakers to tell their story the way they want to. Monsters no longer have to be claymation, the audience can be shown enormous landscapes that were once impossible, a realistic looking weapon can be followed from actor to actor. *Lord of the Rings* showed battles that otherwise would not be even remotely feasible without CGI. Gary Sinise would not have been able to play Lieutenant Dan in *Forrest Gump* without CGI. We definitely would not have any of the amazing Pixar movies without CGI.When sound first came out, the microphones were like a 1970s mainframe. Actors would have to be inside a studio, talking into a large metal device no more than a few feet from their mouth. Dialogue scenes were about as visually interesting as a late night talk show."
"During the silent era, they had some incredible innovation to make interesting images, with moving cameras, moving sets, and they were starting to get really out there. Then sound comes along, and all of that stops. Audiences want talk, not caring what that does to the composition of the image."
"It took at least twenty years for cinematography to get back to what it had been, with filmmakers having to reinvent what was lost.[Correlation does not mean causation](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/false-cause). The silent film era ended around 1928, which also happens to be the very beginning of the Great Depression. With people having no money, that ment studios had smaller budgets for the films. Next Came World War II and resources were used up for the war effort, this ment the studios again had little to work with. You mention that it took 20 years for movies to get good again which happens to be right after WWII ended. I highly doubt that voice killed movie making; it seems to have been the economics of the day.Nah.  There's still great filmmakers out there.  They just don't really make fantasies or sci fi.  Wes Anderson and Paul Thomas Anderson come to mind immediately.  Grand Pudabest Hotel and The Master are both recent movies that are great works of cinema.I don't really agree. I think puppetry and digital art has merged and you see a lot of stuff now that wouldn't be possible without both."
"Lot's of movies you plenty of makeup and puppetry, Pan's labyrinth, hellboy, etc...are you saying that the addition of sound killed the art of filmmaking? If so, I'd be genuinely interested in hearing why you think so.Take a film history class, or just watch a documentary on the silent era. Silent movies had innovated some amazing techniques for moving the camera, montage, telling stories with images, all of which had to be thrown out because now every single scene involved two people talking in a studio into a giant five foot microphone box."
"Technology improved, and the art of film eventually recovered, but it took at least twenty years for cinematography and editing to get back to where they were."
"Edit: You don't actually have to take a class, that sounds a bit snippy. But it's generally accepted that the transition to sound locked everything down and restricted almost all movement. Actors had to mostly be still, everything had to be in a studio, and the camera couldn't move. It'd be like if every Hollywood movie suddenly had to be shot like an 80s three camera sitcom. For that matter, the transition to filming in color borked more than just a few neat tricks they had developed for early special effects, too. Like using different colors of makeup and then applying different colorized lenses to reveal / show the colored parts. You could get some really smooth fade in / fade out transitions in one take that way without having to reshoot scenes, or mess with overlays and splices which *could* be fairly well done but tended to look crude and leave visible outlines or ghosting.Ah now I understand what you're saying. At first I thought you were saying that silent films were just better than any film with sound in it, and that was what I was commenting on. I can completely understand how the transition would've changed things for the worse, at least until the microphone tech caught up.And now I want to watch Farscape again....Anytime someone tries to tell me CGI is better than practical effects, I direct them to [this movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ea5jKFGgUw)The fact that Moranis had to move so slowly and pantomine with the plant (because the puppet was slow moving), shows some real talent.That's why the original Star Wars films were so good and still is to this day.Thank god they are doing more practical in Force Awakens.The same people as Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, Return to Oz, etc worked on parts of Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi (the Jim Henson Creature Shop). Particular Yoda (V) and the Jabba the Hutt (VI) scenes.The latest terminator movie trailer looks like a regurgitated shit pile of CG, and this is from someone who used to do film CG and has mates currently working on it.  Too much, too fake, badly comped. Iron Man 3? The entire movie was a game cinematic."
"Actually, just too much. Lazy film making in a lot of the trailers scenes. It could be done better live, but directors these days like to give themselves options in post, which never looks as good as the real deal.Didn't the visual effects bubble pop a few years back? A lot of my former roommates worked for R&H, and informed me of how backwards the whole industry is run.Sometimes maybe CGI is the better option, if it's used right. Puppet Yoda just looked out of place in The Phantom Menace. I always lamented the fact that the Dementors in Prisoner of Azkaban where at first attempted as puppets, but didn't work out. One wonders what we would have seen.i love that the Nazgul in LOTR are puppets/costumes. When they storm the shire they have a very weird unnatural vibe because they move like freaky puppets.It's also easier to CGI a weird little fat robot thing over stuffing a guy in there who can only stand it for 15 minutes to an hour for filming.My SO was watching the Dark Crystal the other day. I saw the Landstriders and instantly made that connection. I had to pull up pictures of the wheelers to show him. He thought that the Dark Crystal was the only movie to use characters like that and had never heard of Return to Oz. Stupid question: you have seen the Labrynth,right?[deleted]Every time, this is the only way to say it nowMy girls would run out of the room and hide during that scene and then come back to watch the rest of the movie once it was over.  Every once and a while I'll Doooorrothy Gailllllll!! at them to keep them in line ;)My only happy memory of this film is when she gets those awesome lunch boxes from the tree. The rest is utterly terrifying.Same!You just gave me a serious nostalgia trip. My dad would sometimes bring home KFC and we would call them lunch buckets like they looked in the film.Thanks for reminding me of this movie. It was wonderful.I saw this as a kid and forgot what it was called."
"Every time I tried to explain it to someone they thought I was crazy or high."
"Especially when I got to the bit with the flying moose-headed couch thing.Forgot about those parts...this movie really just feels like a bad dream I had.You say wonderful, I say terrifying The heads! The wheelers! The talking chickaaaaaaaahn! Multipass. She *knows* it's a multipass...Wonderfully terrifying. Everyone seems to be creeped out by the wheelers. What about the hall of sleeping heads?Yes, thank you. The wheelers always get a lot of Nightmare Fuel hype but they never bothered me. It's all about the DISEMBODIED SCREAMING HEADS. Or on a more adult level, the fact that a child in dustbowl Kansas is being electroshocked for her imagination.The screaming is much worse than the sleeping. I wasn't scared of the Wheelers, especially with bad ass mofo Tik Tok around."
"I'm still creeped out when Dorothy has to retrieve the key from the head caseThis movie terrified me as a child, still does. It's still strange to think that as a kid, nothing really bothered me. I remember watching The Omen, The Exorcist, Child's Play and I loved them. I put Return To Oz on and I was crying and hiding behind a cushion."
"Too many nightmares about the wheelers, the gnome king and that fucking hallway of heads.Same here, though *MirrorMask* managed to oust *Return to Oz* from the darker corners of my mind.Straight from the start of the movie it was freaky. Especially the doctorsI am 35 years old and I am pretty sure I have never seen this. I didn't even know this existed. Now I need to find a way to watch it.Better get tanked. Watching it sober could melt your mind.I haven't seen them. but [there](https://archive.org/details/TheWizardOfOz1925) are [other](https://archive.org/details/The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz) [Oz](https://archive.org/details/PatchworkOZ) [Movies](https://archive.org/details/His_Maj_Scarecrow_OZ) from the 1910's and 1920's. (in the public domain)"
"That being said, Return was a great movie."
"It's on DVD, you can probably find it cheap somewhere. It's a great movie, scary as hell.Three day rental on Amazon is $2.99Pretty sure I once watched it for free on youtube.Same here, will be finding this & watching!Netflix dvd service (though most people don't use that anymore) had it about 5 years ago, so they might still! Highly recommend!What in the hell is a DVD? :PAmazon I think This is one of my favorite movies. I got the DVD on Amazon Also iTunes and Vudu, according to Moreflicks.Its really excellent, I love it.it's fantastic. i highly recommend it. my favorite movie as a kid, and one i can infinitely rewatch as an adult. it doesn't lose anything.[deleted]Or you could just have gone to Suncoast in 2000 and had them special order the VHS tape from a backstock warehouse in LA.  Not that I'm a big fan of the movie or anything....Although I've always enjoyed the Wizard of OZ it was never as magical to me as this movie was. This movie was magical, and disturbing and weird and a little terrifying, but in a good, other-worldly way. I never feared for Dorothy or her companions in the original film, but I was terrified for them in this one. It's been so many years since I've seen it, and yet I can still remember several of the scenes vividly, as well as the incredible outfit the evil queen lady had... I am not sure if I should rewatch it, or keep my fond memories intact..I think it's because this book is the most authentic version of Oz. I read a *LOT* of the Oz books as a kid (my dad has a bunch of the original ones that used to belong to his mom) and they are imaginative and strange. The series went on for a long time and got incredibly odd and awesome. Watch it again, you won't be disappointed.  The practical effects are still great and there's nothing wrong with the acting.  I watched it as an adult after not seeing for probably over a decade and was pretty floored over how good it still was.   Although I respect your reasoning and am not trying to change your mind, I will let you know that I've seen it a couple of times as an adult and felt it held up."
"Not like She-Ra or Thundercats. ^*sob*> Thundercats. sob"
"Turn that frown UPSIDE DOWN (I can't believe I just said that) with some actual out-takes by the original Thundercats voice actors, complete with animation from the original animators...because apparently they just rolled that way on that show."
"Lady and/or Gentleman, I present: Blundercats."
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWRvkRj8KQA"
"I watched an episode of the original Thundercats cartoon a couple years ago and all the characters spoke sooo slowly.  It was painful.    Slythe...and MummRa....*again.*  It  has.  All been. Their evil plot...from the beginning!"
"-how I imagine the scripts were written."
"Can't beat the music or character design, though.  And the plots were insanely weird, which is a lot of fun.The mechanics of the wheeler costume: nightmares. It's made from nightmares, and powered by fear.The fucking Wheelers.I don't remember this movie. Where is it available?Just ask the Internet nicely.Type watch the return to oz into google and pick a link that works for you. Make sure adblock is installed. Netflix carries it on DVD.  I'm sure a lot of local video stores would have it, too."
"It's also $2.99 to rent on Amazon Instant Video.You can order the DVD online. It wasn't hugely popular so you'd have to be lucky to run into at a store in most places. Or you might be able to find a copy online using other methods that don't involve spending any money at all."
"It wasn't a hugely popular movie. I loved it, but most people I've talked to about it never had a clue that there was a second Oz film. I didn't and I'll be making sure I watch it nowI saw this in the cinema when I was a kid. I even had a book about the film, which sadly disappeared otherwise I'd scan some pages. I also had a book for Dudley Moore's Christmas film Santa Clause: The MovieThis film looks terrifyingIt was def darker than Wizard of Oz. Insanely creepy but i loved it.Poisonnnnn....pooooooison....."
"One of my favorite movies, so incredibly underrated. I have a vivid memory of sobbing in from of a mirror (while wearing red cowboy boots, closest thing to ruby slippers I could find) because I couldn't find Ozma and step through the mirror to Oz[Ab-Roller EXTREME](http://i.imgur.com/e2dlz8m.jpg)That movie is one of my all time faves! Look forward to watching it with my future kids one day.I found a clip of the 24fps claymation. Looks[ very impressive!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4lhGXLzIYQ)I always thought it was weird that Dorothy is like 5 years younger even tho its a sequel.I thought it was weird that the original film has a 16 year old Dorothy.I heard they really wanted Shirley Temple, but her studio couldn't work out a contract so Judy Garland it was. And they did have to go to great lengths to make her look young because she was already smokin' hot. You have the studio system to blame for that. MGM didn't have any age appropriate actresses on contract who could perform the role. It was between Garland and the *older* Deanna Durbin. Durbin's singing voice was too close to the already cast Betty Jaynes so they went with Garland. Jaynes' singing princess subplot was scrapped of you were wondering. Also the rumors about them trying to get Shirley Temple on loan from Fox are unsubstantiated despite being widely reported as fact.Also, they had to tape down Garland's bust to make her look younger.Source? pornhubIt's not a sequel to the movie, it's an adaptation of the book, where she actually is a little girl.Ok then its weird they made an adaption of the book that takes place immediately after the events of the first movie and also drastically changes the main characters without first remaking original.It was nearly forty years after the first filmWell nothing existed before I was born so as far as I'm concerned they came out at the same time.Found the solipsist. It's not an adaptation of the same book, The Wizard of Oz is based off The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and Return to Oz is based off Marvelous Land of Oz and Ozma of Oz.It actually combines two books no less.  This whole project was very, very weird."
"I love that they brought in Jim Henson to do the lion, even though he's only in the movie for a few minutesThis film is the stuff of nightmares and it's amazing. Better than the original as far as I'm concerned.It's good to know filming this movie was as much a nightmare as viewing it.I saw Neverending Story in the cinema at about age 6, and it was one of the best cinematic experiences of my life. I was seriously pumped when we left the cinema and it's still a really vivid memory from 30+ years ago. Return to Oz was for me the next big fantasy movie experience, and it also holds some great memories, the two films were created in an era of cinema for children that is golden for me. Whenever someone asks me what my all-time favorite childhood movie was I tell them Return to Oz. This movie freaked me out when I was a kid but I loved it. I always thought this version of Oz was so fantastical and awesome. Just seeing Mombi and her Wheelers and what happened to Oz was amazing to me. The set, costume and character design is perfect."
"Just the story has so much depth that I wish they spent another hour expanding on. Dorothy being sent away to a mental hospital for her delusions of Oz? Amazing."
"Every time I re-watch this movie, it never gets old. It's a timeless movie in my eyes. How can a photograph be rare? There's one copy of each, just like every other photograph. Well, rare in the sense that they were hardly ever seen by anyone outside of the studio probably."
"In that sense, technically your family photo album is also rare.i like to open them in multiple tabs then curse ops lies!Actually, each of us here now has our own personal copy of these rare photographs in our browser cache.This movie makes Narnia look like apnea. My friends and I have used the wheeler laugh to creep people out for years....let's just say, it's magic!Those. Fucking. Wheelers. Thank you for posting these!"
"I saw this movie in the theater, during its original release, right after I got out of Kindergarten for the year (My mom always used to take me to the movies after the last day of school). I still remember how magical it was. It's one of the few movies I can remember where I was scared, sad, thrilled, and giddy when watching it. It was part of a constellation of similar fantasy movies (Labyrinth, The Dark Crystal, The Never-ending Story) that are inextricably linked to my childhood. I know it wasn't a huge hit and took kind of a critical drubbing, but man, the feels. I have two small kids and see basically every family movie that comes out now, and I don't know if there's anything that comes close. Most kids movies seem to want to protect children from feeling difficult emotions, especially fear. I appreciate that Return to Oz recognizes terror, powerlessness, and existential angst as inescapable parts of life."
"Fuck, though, this movie made me terrified of being institutionalized.HO LEE SHIT!!"
"I remember watching this movie when it was on TV once as a child and I have never been able to remember what movie it was. Attempting to find it again, I have explained the small bits I could remember from my childhood (I somehow didn't remember the connection to Oz as a kid) and no one has known what movie I was talking about. I haven't really looked that hard for it, but it's cool that I've finally found THE movie!"
"Thanks for this post! Time for me to watch this movie again.I feel like Jack Pumpkin head could have been an inspiration for another famous Jack...Well they aren't rare pictures anymore. Sheesh.Haha rareFun fact: The unnamed claymation artist is actually Craig Bartlett, creator of Hey Arnold! and all sorts of other things. :)Am I the only one who loved everything about this movie as a child, and would watch it on repeat?"
"Seriously, any time this movie is mentioned on reddit, it's always wheelers still freak me out, how was this for kids, etc., etc.I'm surprised I've never seen anyone attempt to do a Wheelers Cosplay.  It'd take dedication but the visceral reactions people would have towards it would be totally worth it.Surprised they didn't have any pics of Mombi's heads. She freaked me out more than The Wheelers. Thanks for these. I was delighted when Return to Oz was made, finally something that is true to the original story the way I had imagined it. I had the original OZ books as a kid, and these characters look just like the illustrations from my books. I was kind of a dark kid, so I loved these tales. They were scary, but delightful. Life is not safe, why should kids be kept in cotton wool and fed only cuddly stories?Wheelers always scared me as a kid. That actress is the one from The Waterboy btwAnd The CraftI'm glad I didn't see this as a kid. The wheelers are creepy as fuck. I had enough weird nightmares about Ronald McDonald.A CHICKEN???!!!!!As someone who has never seen this movie, it looks creepy as fuck from these pictures.Cool pictures.  I wish Fairuza got more roles she's pretty awesome in the films she's cast in.Fuck this movie and fuck the wheelers in particular. It scared me so much. Wheelers are evil as fuck, man."
"That whole movie felt like something we shouldn't be seeing. Like the bastard sequel to Wizard of Oz and Oz is corrupt and in ruins.[Reminded me of my favorite Drew Struzan movie poster.](http://i.imgur.com/LYIYxh9.jpg)This movie was the birth of all my nightmares around age 7-8."
"Oh, Wizard of Oz! I'm sure you'll love this sequel! . . . While you're at home sick. With the flu. - Famous last words.Damn I'd forgotten about this movie. When it came out, I didn't have kids yet. But I took my 5 year old nephew and my sister never let me do ANYTHING with him alone ever again. [I made a comment about this movie a little while back](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2yjpva/petrified_wood/cpahy6v). Check out the [pic](https://i.imgur.com/oAve5Kt.png) in the op.That movie scared the shit out of me as a kid. I used to think it was all kinds of fucked up. Even as an adult it still weirds me out a little haha."
"That's crazy about Tik Tok though. I had no idea the guy inside it was in such a position.This fucking movie. Oh yay back to Oz! We get to see the Lion and Scarecrow and all them!  Wait why is that lady taking her head off?They're not _rare_ pictures, they're on the Internet.The last film I watched on VHS too, I still whistle the pattern of sound of my old Sharp player loading and playing a tape.The [wheelers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM0RFE3QGAU), incase people were curious.Still the scariest movie I've ever seen.Absolutely loved this movie as a kid, gave me the best nightmares. I'll never look at Tik Tok the same after this knowing it was the product of some excruciating stress positions (From the looks of it).I remember bringing the vhs my grandpa recorded off of TV in to daycare at my elementary school and getting about 15 minutes in before the teacher pulled it out and put something more appropriate on."
"I thought it was awesome and wanted my friends to see it!I didnt know this movie existed as a kid. Caught it one day on cable on a sick day home from school. I was amazed that there was this whole story about after the first. When she had to go in the room and pick the objects gave me so much anxiety as kid.Anybody know of Return to Oz is available streaming anywhere (Amazon Prime, Netflix any country will do, HBOGO etc)My father has a a couple of huge photo albums of these still photos from the time on set. I remember fondly flipping through them years later. I would go on set on the weekends and holidays when I was out of school. As I was one year older than Fairuza and year younger than Emma (who played Ozma) we'd hang out and have fun in between takes.  When RtO wrapped up filming at Elstree Studios, Labyrinth started up and a lot of the same puppeteers worked on both flicks.  Most underrated film of my childhood.  Even as an 8 year old, I felt respected because they made this film truly horrifying and creepy yet it was still for kids.  The queen with her removable heads, the electro shock therapy scene, the desert that turns you to sand....  insane."
"Ever tried explaining this movie to someone who has never heard of it? By the end of the conversation you both will start questing your sanity. This movie seriously messed me up when I was a kid.The wheeler costume looks like fun, and also like a great way to break your arms *shudders*That movie scared the ever-loving fuck out of me.Yes scared me too as a kid, but looking back on it it was a great movie.How the hell is it that I've never heard of this film?  Fairuza has some of *the* most beautiful eyes I've ever seen.> Tik Tok's costume looks like it would've sucked balls to wear."
"Tik Tok's costume looks like it *was* a ball to wearUnderrated movie. Has always been in my top 10 of all time. Cool pictures. I love it when stuff we've never seen before or has rarely been seen surfaces from these older movies. Also when old lost silent films resurface out of nowhere. One day, 'London After Midnight', one day...."
"Return to Oz is a terrific movie in my eyes and I am glad to hear others actually like it too. I seem to be the only person who digs Oz The Great and Powerful which seems to borrow a few 'dark' elements from this movie."
"RtO is also closer to the books, which are surreal in their own right. I've read a couple of the original novels, of which first prints have been digitized and are available to read online and are totally worth it if you get the chance.I've never heard of this. Now I really want to watch it. I'm going to do it. Thank you for sharing! This is amazing!I never knew this movie even existed and I saw the Wiz. Can someone give me a breakdown as to how or why this movie came about? Was there a second wizard of oz book?![Awesome Scissor Sisters song/tribute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaTGNIsEXGY)Frank L. Baum wrote quite a few. Read the Wikipedia entry.I'm going off memory; I remember my mom taking me to see it in 86? Dorothy had gone back to Oz to retrieve something from the Wicked Witch, I don't remember exactly what it was because well I saw it 30 years ago. I do recall it scaring the shit out of me and in no way is that movie for children. Much like the first one she meets different characters on her way to the witch, some offer her help and some try to rip her to literal pieces. I won't spoil it however there's some scary stalker shit for a kids film.> Dorothy had gone back to Oz to retrieve something from the Wicked Witch."
"Ah no, not exactly. Dorthy's aunt and uncle send her to a mental hospital to help her with her delusions. A flood comes along and when she wakes up after it she is in OZ, but OZ is all jacked up and under Mombi and the gnome king's control instead of Glinda's or  Princess Ozma's. Up-sum from wikipedia and memory: Writer/ director Frank Murch mentioned in ideas meeting that he wanted to do a sequel, Disney happened to own the rights and were going to lose them if they didn't make another movie. The script was based on the second and third Oz books, in as much as they took some ideas and set pieces but largely fashioned their own character arcs."
"As Disney owned the rights, they didn't have to pay MGM a dime to make the movie. Except for the inclusion of the ruby slippers, which cost Disney a lot of money to show. There's something humorous about Disney owning the rights to everything but the ruby slippers.  Like, someone specifically wrote that into a contract.  Ruby slippers were made up by MGM for the movie. The book had silver slippers. Disney owned rights to the books, but since ruby slippers aren't on the books, the rights to use ruby slippers aren't included.There's 18 other Oz books by the original author L Frank Baum. There's also countless others written by other 'royal historians of Oz', including his son and grandchildren.  There was an official Oz club that only ceased to exist in the mid 2000s."
"Edit: spelling > seized to exist"
"it's ceased to existI was staring at it for about 10 minutes wondering why it didn't look right. Thanks. Something I've always wondered. How can a picture or video be rare if it's on the internet? [deleted][deleted][deleted]Flirted with Fairuza Balk.  Tagged as My Hero[deleted]Oh I agree, innocent flirting is fun, and Fairuza would of had the cheesey chat up lines laid on thick even if I didn't recognise her, just because those eyes :pHad a major crush on her when The Craft came out. I've been looking for a girl like that ever since. The fact that she ended up owning a magic shop, with a big ass, and cats, makes my crush even worse. [deleted]:3Panpipes, in Hollywood on Cahuenga :) She sold it, though.[deleted]It's still there! [deleted]Haha omg that's awesome! I live here, so pass by it every now and then. Oddly, Fairuza was the only one missing from the Craft screening last year at Hollywood Forever. Wonder what she's up to.[deleted]one of my all time favorite movies, creeped me out bad as a kid.That room full of heads was the stuff nightmares are made of.I loved this movie! Thank you for sharingcompletely forgot this movie existed. how come it is never brought up?greatest sequel ever. Ive never heard of this. Is it any good?I had no idea Return to Oz existed, but I was born in 1986. I want to watch it.deadly desert!This film was creepy as fuckDoooooooooooorthy Gale!Efff this movie!! Gave me nightmares as a kid.TIL, there is a Disneyland Paris.No one I know has ever seen this movie. I'm so glad OP posted this. The creepiness sticks with you forever.That movie scared the hell out of me. Especially the shock therapy scene Dark as hell and very entertaining.  I'm glad I was in my 20's when it came out... because if it had come out when I was a kid, my Dad would for sure have taken me to it, and I'd have been scarred for life.I love this movie! Thank you for posting these wonderful photos. I've only ever watched this taped from TV.  Possible that there are scenes cut from it I've never seen before?  It's available on Hoopla digital via my local library...I have vague memories of this movie but I still remember that the wheelers would give me nightmares.Im going ro recognoze this as an amazing film with top notch productiin value. But im gonna give it another 20 years before I watch it again. You know, for nightmares sake.Dat vicky valencourt is the devil!I still remember when my grandma had me watch the original and then Return to Oz back to back when I was like 5."
"For all intents and purposes she could have just thrown on The Human Centipede instead and it still would have had basically the same effect on me I know the wheelers were creepy but I always thought this was the [scariest scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XjC_0lGm0E) in the whole film. I still shudder thinking about all those heads waking up UGHJust watched this the other night for the first time with my 5 yr old daughter. It's interesting, I couldn't figure out how the Tik-Tok puppet worked.I was just talking about this film the other day! I loved the book, and I remember as a kid we had a taped (on vhs, of course) TV airing so my sister and I could watch it whenever we wanted. I need to watch it again.Which 2 of the 16 photos are not as rare as the remaining 14? :)That was one dark movie.. Even watching it as an adult it looks dark. BTW, that movie combines two of L Frank Baum's follow-up books.  Can you name them?  No fair peeking at Wikipedia..This movie terrified me but I also loved it. For some reason I remember loving the lunch box tree. Also was emotionally scarred for years by the hallway of heads. Probably the creepiest kids movie I've ever seen. Return to OZ was aggressively creepy. The desert that turns things into sand, the headless woman (Mombi?) and her collection of heads, fuk even TicTok was weird. Funny enough the wheelers were some high octane nightmare fuel until my little 6 year old brain tried to imagine what they would when they got me. Roll me around? They have no hands or feet - just wheels and a dumb sneer."
"Maybe the time has come to watch this movie again. I've got health care now and therapy is covered. Definitely a weird movie... I enjoyed it enough though, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT25vf6ZZ9INever heard of this before, but now I know where Burton got the inspiration for Jack Skellington.This was a movie? I'm remembering an old cartoon series and wondering where Pumpkin Head came from, but haven't seen a trace of it since.I didn't even know this movie existed. This movie had effects and costumes so ahead of its time.  I seriously love this movie.  Will Vinton (pictured animating the Gnome King) would go on to found Will Vinton Studios which would eventually become the animation house Laika."
"Also, I was always struck by how much closer this movie hewed to the books than the original Oz movie. Somehow, that does make it way creepier.Loved this movie growing up! Thanks for the awesome picturesOne of the most terrifying films ever made. Scared the absolute crap out of me as a kid. Watched it later as a teen and adult. Still terrifying. The wheelers are a special brand of nightmare and Mombi...the head swapping queen? Screw that."
"The question is why would they make Dorthy younger in return to Oz?Obviously to appeal to a younger audience but still doesnt make sense chronologically. Dorothy in this film was true to Dorothy's age in the books.  Judy Garland was an older Dorothy in the 1939 film.I hated this movies it scared the shit out of me. also i remember the girl being older than me so its strange to see her so much younger"
"This movie always fascinated me as a kid, I loved how dark and weird it was, way different form the Wizard of Oz. Never has a movie made for kids been so scary.Theres a Wizard of Oz movie I used to watch as a kid, it was animated and I remember there being two movies on the vhs, the WoO one, and something else I don't remember. All I remember about it is that everyone in Emerald City was turned into statues and there was something about peanut butter..also it was animated, so it wasn't this movie. Everytime I search I come up with nothing and its kind of weirdly upsetting.The intro to this film is so fucking good!  Dorothy Gale has been institutionalized because she cant stop talking about Oz and how it was real.  The institution has run out of ideas, so as a last resort they decide to give he electric shock therapy.  Dark shit for a kids movie, and it only gets darkerSerious question: what makes the photos rare? I see that a lot on reddit. How can they be rare if they're on the internet for everyone to see?The Wheelers are less terrifying now.I always wondered if They Might Be Giants song wrote their song Hall of Heads after seeing Princess Mombi's Hall of Heads."
"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2mns0c_princess-mombi-s-hall-of-heads_shortfilmsThat movie made me physically sick it was so fucking disturbing when I was kid. I still refuse to watch it ever again...This movie haunted my dreams for many years.I'm definitely renting this, this weekendI refer to the heads a lot and almost no one I know knows wtf I am talking about.  This movie really left an impression on me.  I remember watching it as a kid on a small tv in a closet while hail pounded the roof.  Just so terrifying.AMAZING movie."
"This goes on my list of movies that were dark when i was a child and i love them for it vs. now things are alot brighter."
"example:"
"Time Bandits - kids parents dieRoll Call: Doesn't understand what classifies digital photos as rareThis movie ruined my childhood. I remember all the creepy things i saw from the movie until now. The OZ books were by far my favorite fantasy series as a kid.Never read the books, Loved this 2nd movie. How accurate of a portrayal are the two films vs. the books in your opinion? I always liked the Darker tone of RtOThe Wheeler looks like a face-plant making device.This movie scared the bejezus out of me when I was a kid. Great pictures - I wish they had one of the closet where the severed heads were stored, or the crazy long-legged roller guys.I had nightmares about all the disembodied heads when I was a kid. And those fucking wheelers. And the faces in the rocks...bloody terrifying.This movie scared me to my core. I legitimately have never seen or heard of this movie. Kind of freaks me out.Back when Disney wad not afraid to, nay went out of its way to, give children nightmares.  I miss that Disney.That movie generally freaked me out as a kid.  I'm 31.I feel like there was a lady sitting on a park bench doing nothing near the end and it was someone now famous, uncredited, like Nicole Kidman and I noticed it later watching it add a teen. Does anyone know what I mean? It's not on IMDb.no rare anymo broI wish practical effects would make a comeback."
"This isn't grumpy old man talk either, I genuinely think practical effects LOOK much better than CGI a lot of times."
"CGI has its place but its way overused.This was the first movie I ever saw in theaters. It's also the first movie I cried in absolute terror in theaters. I remember running for the exit when the wheelers showed up. Yeesh. One of my favorite movies, the macabre side of"
"OzNow no longer rare, but we're the better for it. Thanks for sharing these, u/Scottland83. Much appreciated!Welp they aren't rare anymore. I loved this moviewatched this when i was like 8..... still too scared to re-visit it.I saw the Tick Tock outfit at Skywalker Sound in Marin County, CA last year. It's pretty small.Love this movie!The first photo is him explaining a scene that is going to scare the shit out of the small children whose parents thought this was going to be a safe film to take them to, lol.My mind read Wizard of Oz and I was thinking i had to go back and watch this again - didn't remember any of that!"
"Return to Oz - on my movie list now. Regarding the stop-motion animation, being done on ones just means that there's movement every frame, rather than every two or three frames. This movie scared the effing bejerzus out of me as a kid."
"The wheelie guys are terrifying.If its called Return to OZ, why is Dorothy younger?Oh man, I JUST watched this since the blu ray came out recently. This is so relevant.I have the movie ripped from YouTube (did it like 3 years ago when the full movie was posted) if anyone wants it. Just shoot me a pm. Just know you might not get a reply until tomorrow sometime (I work today).Those Wheelers still scare the shit outta me. This is amazing! Return To Oz was, and still is, one of my favorite movies. :)This movie was amazing. I've always had a soft spot for it. It's miles better than anything we get today. Look how imaginative this was compared to cgi drek. Compare it to the recent Oz attempts!Man, I love this movie.  It's being released on Blu-ray for the first time ever but only to Disney Rewards Members for now.The wheelers gave me nightmares for months!!! Such a scary film! Its weird to think this movie was the one directorial outing of Walter Murch, one of Hollywood's most respected film editors. Only film to creep me out a times, I haven't watched it in years. Shame Walter Murch never directed again but he still continues to be a fantastic editor. I guess I'm one of those who caused the movie to fail. It was well made, but I hated the story."
"Apparently a lot of people agreed with me.This movie is the definition of nightmare fuel. Fucking wheelers are so god damned creepy. This movie is awesome. This movie seriously disturbed me when I was a kid and I don't feel comfortable seeing these pics now and in 37. It's probably the creepiest movie I have ever seen. I freaking LOVE this movie. And everything I love about it is what everyone else finds creepy. I remember putting roller skates on my hands and feet and rolling around my house pretending to be a wheeler.  And I wanted an exchangeable head *so* bad.I saw this movie in Radio city Music hall, when it first came out. My parents thought it was a sequel. I had nightmares for years! a room full of interchangeable heads!!! maybe ill revisit this and watch it again!Was this movie terrible or something? Why have I never heard of it?Damn this movie takes me back.  I need to watch this again.Wait a second, Return to Oz is a real film? Holy shit, For some reason I always thought it was a cancelled production or something and never thought to look it up, as someone that really loves old stop-motion and claymation I mainly want to watch it for that gnome thing.Fucking fuck this movie, this shit gave me the weirdest fucking dreams when I was a kid. I *already* had weird motherfucking dreams, but that bitch with the heads leveled me the hell up in weird-ass-bullshit. Took me ten goddamn years to figure out that scene was from a movie. I ended up watching it at 20 and realized it's exactly as batshit insane as I thought it was."
"Jesus christ. WHO THE FUCK MADE THIS SHIT. WHY GOD WHY.The Wheelers and the hall of heads were utterly disturbing as a child."
"Fortunately, as a 7 year-old when it came out, I had a huge crush on Fairuza Balk so I was still perfectly happy to watch it."
"Great movie, I really should re-watch it Most of the script is probably etched into my subconscious....I grew up in the UK and I remember major kids' show Blue Peter doing a feature on the movie coming out. The guy who was in the Tik Tok costume became a regular presenter on the show. However he didn't last long. It was because he was either gay (this was the 80's) or had actually done or been accused of something inappropriate. I believe he died very young, it may have been AIDS but I'm not sure. I need to look it up. I remember thinking his story was very sad at the time though.I never heard of this film. Is it famous anymore?Wow I had forgotten how much I loved this movie. Now to check Netflix...This was the 1st movie I saw in theatres as a kidThe Siskel and Ebert [review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMoBqw1DWJY) was one of the rare instances where I disagreed with both of them strongly.  They detested and maligned Return to Oz. I recently watched Life Itself, a biopic about Roger Ebert and I was struck by the prescience of Gene's comments about his own funeral in this clip.I've seen people talk about this movie before on Reddit. Is it still worth watching as an adult? I think I want to see it.was it really that long ago, in my head it seems like yesterday. Am I the only person who never knew this movie existed? Now I havta watch it! Doesn't sound like it's too kid friendly.[removed]Thank you!  We had it on Betamax.  No one believed me that it existed and for a long while I thought I had dreamt it or something.  Convo usually went something like--"
"me-- Have you seen Return to Oz?"
"them-- What's that?"
"me-- Wizard of Oz II"
"them-- There isn't a Wizard of Oz II."
"me-- Yeah there is!  Dorothy gets sent to the insane asylum for talking about Oz and they give her electro-shock therapy so she runs away and ends up back in Oz!"
"them-- That... doesn't exist..."
"me-- Yeah it does!  There's a sea of sand that swallows people and evil scary hyena guys with wheels for hands and a lady who cuts off people's heads and wears them and..."
"them-- That never happened.  No one would make a movie like that for children!"
"After enough people tell you that, you start to believe them.  Finally a few years ago I rented the DVD from Netflix (back when you still did that) and made all my friends watch it to prove I wasn't crazy (unlike Dorothy, apparently).My back hurts.This movie was so creepyI don't know if it's spelled out in the movie, but I believe it's supposed to be the Nome King.  No 'g'Getting a group of people together to cosplay as Wheelers would totally traumatize some people, I think.This whole thread is now FULL of films that I am too terrified to re-watch. Thanks, OP?Great film!  TIL there was a sequel to The Wizard of Oz I did not know this movie existsI can't watch videos or youtube or anything at the moment at work, but was there a scene in this film where a baddies scratches or peels off some skin from a goodies face and breathes (maybe blue?) fire on it?"
"If not but anybody does know what I'm talking about what is it?Ah, the bastard stepchild of Oz movies."
"If you were a kid in the 80s, it wasn't all that half bad. The special effects were top notch for the time. It was as over-hyped, and about as loved as Santa Claus the Movie though.Favorite movie of all time. I mean, picnic basket trees and a room full of treasures? Momba? Her hall of mirrors and replacement heads? What's not to love?God damn wheelers and their nightmare inducing selves. Fuck you.I've loved this movie since I was a kid. One of my absolute favorites.Am I the only 30 something that didn't see this movie?Wow. I did not know that was Fairuza Balk!I love the original Oz books. I don't know why the screwed up the latest one so badly. Franco was just awful in it. Wrong kind of humor for Oz, the books are somewhat darker. Wish someone would make a series that stays true to the darkness of the books. People could be chopped into 1,000 pieces and never die in Oz... that's awesome!That movie was played so much in my house growing up, the tape had to be replaced a few times.  I freaking loved this film way better than the first.    I always remember this flick as giving me nightmares. Still checks out.Favoritest favorite favorite ever. [RTOZ colour WIP](http://i.imgur.com/ufR0XVb.jpg)I thought I dreamed this movie when I was a kid, and I assumed my memories of it were from those dreams...  I was sure it was too creepy to be real.Directed by Walter Murch. This is the [only film he directed](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004555/?ref_=nv_sr_1). He's an ace editor though, mostly with Frances Ford Coppola. He re-edited the Redux Apocalypse Now. There is a also a [documentary about editing](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0428441/) that features him quite prominently.My old school did a musical version of this I was roped in by my step mother (music teacher at the school) to make a cd of sound effects and songs etc in order for them. It was around the time black eyed peas lady lumps was popular as we joked they should change the lyrics to my lovely gump I just realized that Fairuza Balk (Waterboy, Goodfellas) plays Dorothy.  Mind = blownThis is especially awesome to see since I just watched Return To Oz again recently the other night. It would've sucked staying in the Tik Tok costume and the Wheelers as well I imagineThis movie scared me as a child. One of the weirdest movies I've ever seen. And I'm 33 and have seen my share of movies."
"But I thank you for the reminder of this movie. I need to watch it again. For years I have been trying to think of the name.of this movie j saw it as a kid and no one I knew had heard of it and it was before we had the internet and I supose I never thought to look it up since then.TIL The Wizard of Oz had a sequel.This movie scared the SHIT out of me back when it came out. Jesus.Amazing! Wow... I thought I hallucinated watching a sequel to Wizard of Oz... I guess I was wrong.http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Return-to-Oz-Blu-ray/42176/I was nine when I saw this movie. It scared me so much I had nightmares about it until I was twelve."
"And the most messed up part was that we watched this in school. In school! Why? Why!? I didn't even have a choice. I HAD TO WATCH IT. Brutal.I loved this movie!That was the worst acid trip of a movie ever. Seriously what the fuckI really hope that movies will start to integrate some more of these types of organic special effects again soon.  I mean, CGI is cool and all but, there's a realness to this sort of thing.  The Nightmare Before Christmas vs. The Corpse Bride is a good example.For the longest time I thought I had made that whole movie up in my head when I was a kid because no one had ever heard of it before.HOLY CRAP!"
"This is the movie that I had convinced myself didn't exist because literally no one I talked to remembered it.  Of course, I had told them it was a horror movie.  Never occurred to me it was an Oz movie.I try to get my friends to watch this.  They never doI was in Cali last year and hung out with Emma Rigby. I didn't know she played in this movie till I watched the credits roll a few months ago. Crazy. So glad to see this film hasn't been forgotten.TIL Fairuza Balk was in Return to Oz long before she was Vicky Valencourt."
"My all time favorite movie girlfriend.I'm a 37 year old man and this is one of my favorite movies of all time.  My aunt took me as a kid to see this in the theater.  I am a huge Oz fan.  I devoured those books as a kid (for the first time at my aunts house) and I remember how excited my aunt got when this was coming out and that she could take me.  It's SO much better than the original to me because it was more like the books.  It mentions under one of the images that one of the puppets used for tik tok is housed in disneyland paris. Does anybody know where?The hall of heads ruined me for life!This movie was haunting.  It's still not bad! Cool pictures!On another note, at what point after being on the Internet does a picture become rare?;) while not really rare, I would think they would be less well known. First and foremost, this is an amazing gallery.  Thanks OP. That said, does the word rare have to be used in describing? I mean if they were rare,  they're not now.  Thanks again, these deserve to be shared. After looking at these pictures, it reminds me of Bioshock Infinite.I had successfully gone years without remembering that this horrifying movie ever existed... Damn you, OP...Well they're not rare no more are they?You guys are all scared of the wheelers but for me the scariest part is that they were about to use electro shock therapy on a little girl. I didn't even know what that was when I was a little kid and I was still terrified of it when I saw them getting ready to use it on her. I really, truly do not understand all the people who are/were creeped out by this movie.  Yes, it's creepy, but it's also magical and it just has this...vibe that really resonated with me as a kid, and still does.  Of all the amazing kid's movies that came out in the 80s, this one is my hand's down favorite.  I have it on VHS and still watch it about once a year.  I can't wait to show it my daughter!How can these be considered rare? They're on the internet. This title made me really want a rare 14 oz steak"
"This is one of those I loved this movie as a kid but when I watch it now I realize just how fucking terrible it really was films...The Wheelers are the stuff of nightmaresI loved this movie as a kid.  I completely forgot about it.  It was terrifying. Walter Murch. Crazy crazy old man. Egotistical and he thinks he's gods gift. My favorite thing ever is how he has a editing position where he stands on the balls of his feet or something...This movie was clearly about mind control and MK-ULTRAI just watched this with my 4yr old daughter last week. Im 37 & never seen it as a kid."
"All I can say is WTF?!? This movie felt like a bad acid trip to me. I asked my daughter if we could turn it off lol...nope had to ride it out like a champ. Was super creepy with a large dash of shitty.How are photographs rare in the digital era? IF THEY ARE ON THE INTERNET THEY ARE NOT RAREThis film is waaaaayyyy to scary to be a kids movie. No thank you.Sad no one else seems to have read the books. I still own them all they are filled with delightful and demented ideas. I remember being mad at the movie getting stuff wrong, notably the Gnome king who was a really pissy little dwarf guy, I mean come on there are illustrations in the books! I never could figure out why they made him just a face in rock.OK gotta admit I have never seen this movie, and from what I have read so far, I probably won't. My nightmares need no further encouragement or raw material. However, I did see the original Wizard of Oz when I was a kid, and holy mother of god, those flying monkeys... they will be swooping down from black forested skies until the day I die, that children, was pure terror... death on wings with no escape!Ive always loved the oz movies but those wheelers, FUCK THAT! If the first wizard of oz book was meant as a warning about silver and gold what was this one about?How are they rare? That movie sucked balls.Movies like this make me even happier that I have a four year old son to fuck with. To be fair, Gmork from Neverending Story didn't even phase him, so I'm guessing he'll dig Return to Oz.rare photographsNot a very good movie. Way too weird and rather scary for kids.Supposedly this entire movie is about [MK Ultra Programming](http://vigilantcitizen.com/moviesandtv/return-oz-creepy-disney-movie-blatantly-mind-control/)What a legit sounding site and claim!Very interesting take on the symbology in this film."

"13 years later,''Reign of Fire'' still holds title for best CGI dragons ever on screen.I've always like the way the dragons 'leak' fire. Very original and very cool.It's part of the huge effort put into sciencing them up. It's organical napalm and they're a breed of dinosaurs that didn't get extinct but instead kept humanity in the dark ages for centuries until the prey/predator cyclus put them into hibernation etc."
"That's what made me love it so much. There's no shortcuts anywhere. It's always bothered me that people never go into the details of things like this.  IMO that was a brilliant way to create realistic dragons.Most of the time people don't go into those details because it can get SUPER STUPID, super quick. (Remember midichlorians?) It takes a rare writer to give that kind of insight on the fantastical. Most stories are better served by simply asking the audience to accept certain realities about the world out of hand. what a perfect example.  we, as the audience, are coming to you because we're willing to suspend disbelief to enjoy an experience.  please don't bog us down.Exactly. Unless you've got the next level in your trope, just leave it alone and focus on the characterization and world building. Many is the otherwise good movie that jumped the rails by trying too hard to insist upon justifying itself with details that made no sense. The audience came preconditioned to accept those fantasy elements. Learn to take yes for an answer. organicalDon't forget about cyclusI like that, sciencing up the dragons. I seem to remember something similar from an old cartoon called Flight of the dragons where the dragons had to eat a certain kind of rock so their flames could ignite.  I could have that wrong though cus it was forever ago.The Dragons of Pern book series have something similar like that with their dragons - they have to chew up a rock (called firestone) which releases phospherine gas they could use to spew fire. And those dragons were actually scienced up and created to combat a different lifeform. Really liked how they were created by an advanced human civilization.Someone should make an MMO game with these science-based dragons. http://imgur.com/gallery/vncZ8J3What's the joke here?https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/p1ssv"
"Basically, some random person came onto /r/gaming and said I have a great idea for a game and want to make an MMO. What made it famous was the top comment, which gave a detailed account that didn't dismiss the idea, but made it very clear creating a game, let alone an MMO, isn't something for amateurs.I mean, it's not impossible for amateurs to make an MMO. The problem was all she had to show for it was some very generic dragon models superimposed over prerendered (stolen?) backgrounds. That's a bit like saying you're making a movie when all you have is a generic cheesy tagline. It's not impossible, but the TL;DR for my post was *for the love of God don't make it your first project!* It's like starting filmmaking with a full-scale recreation of both the LOTR and the Hobbit trilogies completely remade in lifelike CGI, rather than starting with ... oh, something on the scale of *Clerks*.And that's how I became reddit famous.By being nice and constructive."
"You're a unicorn.I remember.I was there...Go home Brian WilliamsI dunno, sounds complex. Maybe an /r/Gaming thread should be made to get some advice on how it should be developed. I'll get started on some shitty-looking concept pics. Sigh... I'll go put another pot of coffee on... looks like it'll be a long one.Sounds like something that can be done within 3 years!Let me fire up the Kickstarter!"
"How much money should I ask for? Mind you I have zero game developer experience, so all I should need is a digital artist and programmer right?Ballpark $10-25m, so if we're going to open studio in SF and hire Peter Moullineux for publicity, yeah, that's exactly what we'll affordIf peter is involved, I'll assume we will be able to do eevvvrrrythiiinngg in the game."
"...then on final release we can do like 5% of the stuff.But that 5% will *definitely* include important things like farting. 3 years of game design, 2 years of beta. 2 weeks of servers online before free to play. Pretty damn true. You forgot Early Access for a year (or two) though. Then there's the Closed Beta and Open Beta. This entire time people will be claiming how the game is just in beta while it's in that beta stage for a couple of years. Then after it's released and out of beta (after the Early Access, Closed Beta and Open Beta stages) people will still be saying that it's still a work in progress and we need to give the developers time. Even though we have been playing it for several years after those 3 years of development not counting beta and early access."
"So typical today.Best post-apocalyptic, male beefcake, neo-medievalist dragon film, ever.It's such a ridiculous and fun movie. I need to rewatch it.We need more post-apocalyptic, male beefcake, neo-medievalist dragon films, thats a nice genreIn a world where the Fukushima fallout has reached it's inevitable conclusion.... one man....Coming this summer... Two brothers. In a van. And then a meteor hit. And they ran as fast as they could. From giant cat-monsters. And then a giant tornado came. And that's when things got knocked into twelfth gear...I NEED A JAN-MICHAEL VINCENTIf you take out the dragon there's 13th Warrior with Antonio Banderas."
"I really liked that film, or at least one part of it. When Banderas joins up with a group of other warriors (he is the 13th) and he from a foreign land and does not speak their language, they show them sitting around the campfire talking. As it starts, it's all in a foreign tongue. As the camera circles (and shows time passing) a few words start to filter into English, and then more and more."
"I really like when movies take the time to address the fact that: no, not everyone everywhere speaks the same language, and if you find yourself in a foreign land, you are not going to be able to communicate immediately. You can pick up the language, but that takes time.Another shot of this same concept is when Antonio's character and his friend first meet the Northmen they're walking through one of their tents trying to talk to them in various languages and after like three tries they finally meet the redhead that speaks Greek. Then for the next few scenes it shows the redhead translating everything into Greek and then his friend translating it into English for Antonio's character. The key is realism. In the real world we know language barriers can be serious obstacles, but in movies, all too often, everyone speaks the same language. It's very convenient for the audience and the plot, but it makes the suspension of disbelief just a little bit harder.The 13th warrior is very underrated in my book. It's one of my favorites and I've seen it about 100 times.It's right next to Conan as one of the best macho-manly fantasy movies ever.  Buliwyf's death scene is one of my favorite scenes in all of film.It's great but the book title is better: Eaters Of The Dead. We were wacked out on shrooms one time and were all talking nothing but nonsense and laughing a lot. I turned to a friend and asked him how he could understand any of what I was saying."
"His response: *I listen*"
"I really enjoy The 13th WarriorLo, there do I see my father. 'Lo, there do I see..."
"My mother, and my sisters, and my brothers."
"Lo, there do I see..."
"The line of my people..."
"Back to the beginning."
"Lo, they do call to me."
"They bid me take my place among them."
"In the halls of Valhalla..."
"Where the brave..."
"May live..."
"...Forever."
"-------------------------------------------------------------------------"
"I still recite that sometimes ... when I have to take the late night Metro.I liked the 13th Warrior as well but it seems like people like to shit on the movie. But it's rather entertaining."
"It's made from honey! is something I still frequently yell if anything is made from..well... honey."
"And I still love the part where he gets the viking sword and says"
"it's too heavy and the guy replies then grow stronger. So then he grinds the sword down smaller and shows he knows how to use it and the one guy say When you die can I give that to my daughter?Moving dirt at work. Getting a little tired and let out a sigh. Coworker looks at me and says, Don't worry brother. There are more."
"So of course I had to accuse him of digging like an animal. This did not, however, devolve into an engineering dispute.For whatever reason that made me think of the badass line (from totally diff source):"
"**I was born without claws, without fangs, without scales. So I forged them in fire and crafted them of steel.**Wow if that's not the greatest humanity fuck yeah statement ever. Well what's that from?Mighty ducks.QUACK! QUACK! QUACK!I think what makes these dragons so convincing is that they're really cleverly shot. Notice how many shots of them are through fog, or mist, or through a grating, or at night. Some people might consider this 'cheating' but I think it's just good filmmaking."
"If you put a dragon or fantastic creature out in the open with broad sunlight and a motion controlled camera, it's going to look fake no matter how well the creature is modeled and animated, because if the creature was real you'd never film it that way. Here, in Reign of Fire, it feels like they actually were capturing dragons flying by, hence 'imperfect' and 'dirty' shots that actually make it more convincing."
"Honestly, 90% of what makes CGI convincing is the lighting and integration into the environment. A lot of CGI-heavy movies put together these impossible shots that are all perfectly exposed in direct sunlight and of course it looks fake. Real stuff has imperfections and limits."
"Thanks for sharing this, I actually have never seen the movie but these clips make me want to. I've heard mixed things about the other aspects of the film, but hey, I'm a sucker for dragons."
"Except Eragon. Maybe I missed out on the book train but what was up with that movie."
"EDIT: For those pointing out District 9 and how Blomkamp often shoots broad sunlight on CGI elements, note how he usually uses handheld cameras, lots of haze in the air, and the subjects are usually hard-shelled and shiny. This allows for highlights on the object, and those little points of overexposure makes it look more believable. Very clever filmmaking!The book was decent considering it was written by a fifteen year old, but yeah that movie was garbage.This is the ONLY way batman works too. Yea , I don't understand why even at 2015 , that they make some of the CGI shots / creatures so damn bright and shiny and clean. If they made some of the effects a little darker , dirtier etc. It would make these scenes look much more believable. I enjoyed the film, but I'm not sure there is much to see after watching that video to be honest! Film maker here.   Good cgi is good and bad cgi is bad. There is really no rules, you can't quantify film making down like that. Also the best cgi is where you can't tell its cgi like in wolf of Wall Street. If thr audience says hey that's good cgi, you failed. Also blomkamp is a talentless twat.  > Some people might consider this 'cheating' but I think it's just good filmmaking."
"Cheating only applies to fake competitions, like tests and races, not real life things like solving problems or getting to places."
"IMO, cheating at film-making is impossible by definition.The Hobbit movies are like the exact opposite of this. Especially in the third, absolutely nothing looked convincing. Ugly ugly movie.Yeah, the eragon movie was garbage, doesn't do the book justice at allThis may be a lost comment you never see my friend. But Eragon is a fantastic series of books. Its a shame how they botched the movie :/ but it really is a magical read, the connection between Eragon and his dragon is enticing. The books are good. Second ones probably the best. The last 2 draw it out a little. If your into fantasy and like dragons I'd say get them from the library probably take less then a month to read the whole series. But you're right tye movie was terrible and the dragon looked like shit. The supporting cast was great the kid they got for Eragon was terrible and suffered from his lack of any setting but whiny. What Eragon movie? They never made one! I'm so glad they didn't throw together a shitty movie to ruin the whole franchise. An act like that could make a guy go into denial... I think why they did that with the newest Godzilla. All the fights were night fights and dark scenes. The very last scene must of cost them a ton being in the daylight. I have such conflicted emotions about Eragon. Each of the books was a very enjoyable read, each for very different reasons. If I could go back in time and prevent the movie from ever being made, I would, in a heartbeat, because it soured so many peoples impressions and did such a terrible job of representing the books."
"As a teenager reading them as one of my earliest big fantasy series, I fell in love; today, I am almost afraid to go back to read them and tarnish the way I feel about them. If you haven't read them, at least give the first one two a shot, as they have their own merits. The second, Eldest, was the only book I have truly destroyed as a result of reading it so much.While the cinematography was kinda shitty I though Game of Thrones did decent."
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_NElcXX_x0The scenes where Emilia is on the dragon contrast so much from the CG it is jarring. the dragon looks super good when she is not on it.The Inheritance books really weren't great fantasy as far as storytelling goes. The prose were pretty bad (especially the first two books) and there was very little original character or story content. The first novel was so similar to the story of Star Wars that it's difficult to believe the author didn't realize he was almost plagiarizing content. I honestly don't think he realized it, but it's super obvious while reading the story. You didn't miss out on much. The novels were mostly successful because of good marketing which centered around how young the author was when he started the series (started writing the first book when he was 15 I think)."
"On the other hand, I think the movie Reign of Fire is fairly underrated and a lot of fun to watch, so you should totally check it out. I enjoyed the books. They weren't genre defining by any means, but they were entertaining. I also never understood the comparison to Star Wars. The only thing I head was that Eragon was raised by his Aunt/Uncle and there was an old nomad guy who trains him. That's is a pretty weak basis to say they are very similar. It's a pretty cheesey movie in some regards and some things about the plot don't add up but it's enjoyable to me in the same way that Army of Darkness is... is it ridiculous? Yes. Is it totally awesome? Yes. Incase anyone misunderstands your comment I think it needs to be pointed out that Army of Darkness and Reign of Fire have completely different tones. AoD is a self aware horror comedy, RoF is a completely straight faced post-apocalyptic drama more than anything. I think the reason it wasn't very well received is because it's rather boring considering its title. There are long stretches where nothing happens if you go in expecting an action movie with dragons.Exactly how I feel. I was surprised at how fake the new Jurassic park looked. So much exaggeration in the animation, and the lighting was horrible. For the exact same reasons you mentioned the original Jurassic park still looks like it has the best dinosaurs. Some of the CG was pretty nice, but I feel like the film would have desperately benefited from a few more animatronics rather than just the Apatasaur(I think it was?) head. For example, some of the baby dinos that are 'held' by park employees, or even the raptor heads rather than the maquettes that were CGed over. Good points all. Battlestar Galactica did something similar for their space shots that worked really well. Lots of over-zooms and tracking as if a camera man was actually trying to follow the ships in flight.Same with Firefly and to a lesser extent Babylon 5, although B5 looks fake mostly from the poor resolution it was done in.The movie shit all over the spirit of the books. The books are fairly predictable but there is some original concepts in it and overall I really enjoyed the series and I'll go back and read it occasionally. I loved the books... Used to listen to them when i drove back and forth to school all the time. The movie was such a heaping pile of shit that it still pisses me off. They're not perfect books, and they obviously pinch ideas from various other series but they're decent fantasy for teenagers. I remember reading Eragon and wanting to read every single piece of fantasy I could get my hands on, probably wouldn't have read Lord Of The Rings if it wasn't for Eragon. Man, I was obsessed with Eragon in Junior High. I didn't read a whole lot of literature at all, so to me, Eragon was one of the best series I read. At the time, mind you. Well said."
"Also what adds to their realism is part of the reason the fire breathing shots looks so bloody real, is because most of them were. Compared to the [dragon scene in Harry Potter](https://youtu.be/Gsi9MxbZnzU?t=1m47s), where you can immediately tell the fire is fake because its completely CG."
"In the other BTHS video i linked, they show how they came up with these shots in part with a massive custom made fire-shooting crane."
"As far as the movie itself, if you go in without any huge expectations, I think you can appreciate it for what it is. Hell, I'd even recommend it just for the dragon scenes. Speaking of other dragon scenes, everything about this montage gives me massive nostalgia for Dragonslayer (1981).   A number of the sets, costumes, and the shape and animations of the dragons in particular."
"While Reign of Fire definitely has the newer, smoother effects, if you're a fan of dragons, check out Dragonslayer.   It's absolutely mind boggling how good the effects look for a movie of its time.  (I heard it was financed by Disney as a way to test the absolute limits of special effects of its day.   Also, it may have a Disney label, but it's not really for kids, it's quite dark and violent.)I thought of the same movie when they said best dragon.  I watched Dragonlsayer as a kid and it was dark as hell.  I'm sorry but especially when it comes to fire, saying that it sucks because it's completely cg is inaccurate. It's poorly done cg so yes it's noticeable. However, people only see the bad cgi. I recommend [watching this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL6hp8BKB24).Everyone watch thisAnd Matthew McConaughey's character. Playing a straight up badass during his romcom period....holy shit that was Matthew McConaughey.No no no no. If we're talking about that jnsane guy with the axe I refuse to believe that's himCan you not handle him in a cool part? You're way behind on the McConnaissance.That movie had a pretty loaded cast. Christian Bale, Matthew McConaughey, Gerard Butler, Alexander Siddig...Envy the country that has heroes! huh? I say pity the country that needs emfukn rektVan Zan was a beast. He played that role exceptionally well.This is exactly why Blomkamp's CGI always comes off so well in his movies. It's how he combines it with more fluid, natural cinematography. Everything is imperfect and filmed as if it were true to life. Now, if only he could get someone to polish up his screenplays, he'd make better movies, but as far as effects are concerned, I think he's got some of the best looking CGI out there in terms of realism.He also uses smooth surfaces and doesn't try to animate human looking eyes, which both go a long way.  It's much easier to make a compelling alien with an exoskeleton instead of skin and hair, and it's much easier to make a compelling CGI robot than a CGI human.  And I agree with OP, that's clever and effective use of the technology, not cheating.>He also uses smooth surfaces"
"It's actually called hard-surface modeling. Good to know, thanks!Absolutely agree."
"Blomkamp is absolutely amazing at creating worlds that look like real places. He's on a par with Ridley Scott in the ability to perfectly visualise the spaces that his stories take place in."
"People may criticise Elysium and Chappie, but the one thing that is undeniable is that you never, ever doubted the reality that was presented to you.totally agree. With Chappie, the issue wasn't with the believability of the robot at all. It was more like, that real robot and everyone else in the film are annoying douchebagsI fucking love chappie bro :(WHY YOU STEAL DADDIES CAR?!?!Gangster Chappie was so hilarious and awesome. I'm part of the minority who loved the film.His Halo shorts were so great at depicting the oh shit feeling of fighting the Brutes the Marines would have felt. Yeah, loved them. Such a shame the Halo movie died a death.This is what made original Jurassic Park hold up so wellYeah Jurassic Park does look great but a few shots do stand out as obvious Cgi. The scene where Grant and the kids are running through the field and a TRex attacks the other dinosaurs is in the open and broad daylight and it looks kinda rough. Yeah the Gallimimus scene was the showcase for the cgi in that film, so it was pretty visual but doesn't hold up too well - daytime lighting, no puppetry etc - I'm still pretty satisfied with the rest of it, though. The first T-Rex scene still sends shivers down my spine.The first CGI dinosaur seen in Jurassic Park, the Brachiosaurus, does not look ~~well~~ good."
"edit: good. GOOD for fucks sake, there I changed it.Seeing it in 1993, it looked spectacular.  http://i.imgur.com/JywXMrb.gifAs well as Aliens.Aliens held up well because that's all practical effects.  They didn't have CGI back then.But the same applies to practical effects. And monsters in general really, the human mind is so much better at filling in the scary details than our ability to show them (as practical or computer generated effects).> They didn't have CGI back then."
"Sure they did, it was just very early stages of development and was not discernable from other types of animated effects of the time.  The Black Hole  was released in 79 with CGI effects."
"Edit:  [And apparently Alien also used CGI](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_computer_animation_in_film_and_television#/search)If I'm not mistaken...those are the same kind of wireframe models used in Honey I shrunk the kids, they depicted 3D graphics, not any creature effects. It was more to demonstrate that computers can model imagery, because the graphical user interface itself was a pretty novel thing at the time when the film came out.I know but I meant it was their use of cinematography that made those miniatures and practical effects look realistic.But they also operated on the same principle, because suited dudes don't exactly look like intimidating, world-ending aliens."
"So you rarely get a full body shot of an alien in either Alien or Aliens, and when you do, it's either dark as fuck or just chaotic as hell so you still don't really *see* the alien. I don't remember the exact number, but the standard xenomorphs actually only get like 14 minutes onscreen in a 2.5+ hour long film.[This part in particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-mmbStFrAA#t=0m49s) illustrates this point rather well. Don't get me wrong, I love the Alien series, but damn if that scene doesn't make me chuckle every time.Haha, it's definitely rose-colored glasses that makes people forget about scenes like this.Maybe, but it's pretty great if a movie has just that one scene that didn't hold up well, compared to so many big-budget CGI movies where there isn't a single moment that the monster feels real or convincing. Also the [jazz hands](http://i.imgur.com/ZzGlQZt.png) bit in the vent. It's a very quick shot, but it still seems to linger slightly too long and all I see is a man in a suit. Doing jazz hands.Same. That's the thing that bugged me the most in that movie.I think any good monster is made through limited screen time. The suspense factor really ratchets up the scare factor.Quality over quantity every time. Darth Vader is my favourite example - just 12 minutes of screen time in A New Hope.And I think Hannibal Lecter had 11 minutes!Very true, I think this is the reason they left out the [infamous crab walking scene from Alien](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR5jYeIMBKk), it absolutely looks like a dude in a suit and would have ruined the mystique of the alien. I have mixed feelings on that scene. On one hand, it's silly to look at. On the other, it shows that the creature is still a child, and it would be horrifying as fuck to see a xenomorph crab walk at you, it's taunting you. True, perhaps they could have pulled it off with different camera angles but even still, that position makes it seem vulnerable and less menacing to me."
"Having said that, if I saw that in real life I would shit and die.I agree that this scene probably wouldn't have worked in the original film mostly because as you said, it ruins the mystique of the alien."
"But ignoring that fact, I think I tend to like the idea of the xenomorph being more bipedal and having these very human movements as compared to the quadrupedal, more animalistic movement given to them in the future films."
"Granted, they come across as being more deadly in the sequels, but for some reason seeing one move in this way gives me a much more uneasy feeling.Well from what I understand they take on the mannerisms of whatever host they incubated in. That's why I figured the alien in the first one was more human like. Also why in the third movie the alien ran on all fours because it infected a dog. My girlfriend killed the mystique dead when she instantly pointed out that the inside of the egg was raw chicken breasts.Never noticed this.  Your girlfriend has a good eye for breasts.I love that first shot of it sitting motionless, you can't tell exactly how its limbs are articulated, it's got that spooky sillhouette vibe. And then I LOVE the tail unfurling and pointing up at her. Then cut it there. everything after spoiled the immersionOk..*that*, yes. But that crap with the tail was creepy. If Scott had left that in, properly cut, it would have worked.Oh wow, there was no part of that scene that didn't look dumb. From the crab walking to the fact that it stood way too straight.I liked how the tail unfurled. They should have kept that bit in.everyone knows they used real dinosaurs for jurassic park, that's why it's so goodRichard Attenborough really is a fantastic actor.Spared no expense This comment makes me happy it was my first ever job in CGI to work on this film. I don't remember much of working on the gig as I was working around the clock and sleeping under the office table when I could."
"EDIT - Forward many years. And here I am working at 1:30 AM on a sunday night sitting at my desk... Warning to anyone to wants to make film CGI for living. you won't do much living.I had a DVD with behind the scenes info and feature-ettes(mobile). From what I saw in the design of the dragons,the co-operation with on set fire marshalls, and attention to detail. You all did an amazing job and RoF is a post Apoc film that I love to reference and discuss with my colleagues."
"Ie. Mimicking the dragons body movement to that of a jaguar/panther while replacing front legs with folded wings, that can walk on land but are limited.(similar to bats) Absolutely brilliant creature design."
"Stay classy Mann.This is one of my favorite films ever, thanks for contributing to itThank you for your service! * salute *People give this movie a lot of crap but when I was a kid this was one of the most memorable movies for me."
"Sure, it's a bit campy, unintentionally, at times. I actually really like it though. It's the first movie that made me take notice of McConaughey. Shaved head, scruffy beard, way out of character for him. He actually vaguely reminds me of the Techno Viking."
"The movie was captivating. Was it realistic? No. But it sure as heck is fun to watch and become engrossed in.I wrote a school essay on it. My teacher appreciated my excitement but urged me to pick a *real* movie next time.I know this isn't polite or considerate, but man, *fuck* those teachers. I had a few as well, and those people are the bane of my existence. I remember wanting to do my Language reading assignment (They made us read 4 books  a year and write summaries about them) in middle school and my teacher saying I couldn't use Harry Potter, because it wasn't literature."
"I hated that teacher for, like, an hour.It's just funny how I've met multiple professors at college with doctoral degrees pertaining to literature and who talk about specializations in things like Harry Potter, The Hobbit or Twilight, and then you've got *these* teachers who constantly talk about what is and isn't literature."
"If we want to get really artistic and technical, a t-shirt graphic for a concert is literature. A pamphlet encouraging students to study abroad is literature. A sticky note that my mom left in my lunch when I was seven is literature. Literature is a massive category. In reality, if it's got writing on it, it's probably literature. There's this weird idea in grade school that if the book you're reading is *enjoyable*, you're not learning anything. Fuck teaching kids to enjoy reading! Now suffer through the meandering, boring non-sense that is The Old Man And The Sea, because that's a *real* book!"
"(Don't get me wrong, OMATS is legitimately good literature, but it's fucking tedious when you're a kid. Not a fun read at all.)That was a palpable undercurrent throughout my whole K-12 education; if you're having fun, it's not Learning; Real Life isn't all about you/fun, and that's what we're training you for (because *we care*, we're only trying to *help*)."
"I like John Gatto's analysis on how current school practices actually hurt everyone more than they help.OK: next paper will be on The Fast and The Furious 31: Most Furiousness!Fast and Furious 31: rise of furiosa Fast and Furious 32: Dawn of FuryanNo, that's  the title for the 12th movie.

Thanks so much everyone. I've never self promoted and now you are all doing it for me. Thank you!Hey all the credit goes to you for assembling all the scenes and adding some catchy tunes. I just shared the link. ;)I love that this movie is getting a revival on /r/movies. Between this and the post about the Star Wars reenactment scene awhile ago, it's great to revisit it."
"Also, whatever happened to Izabella Scorupco's career? She was in this and, of course, *GoldenEye*, but never really hit the A-list. I think she's a pretty great actress.Could you link the Star Wars scene you were mentioning? :)Here you go! https://youtu.be/NCBA1wii70oHoly shit, the kid on the right at 0:30 is really into it, haha.This scene is the reason why, when I found it in a second-hand book store, I purchased the paperback novelization of the original Star Wars trilogy. So that, one day, when the dragon apocalypse has come, I can join a troop of wandering bards performing the great stories of the past.She had a kid in 2003 and pretty much quit acting after that. Even still do you honestly think she's a great actress? She's fucking gorgeous but I was never wowed by her acting chops. She was ok. Being a pretty person who is an ok actor/actress is a good enough combination for a huge amount of Hollywood and TV.That's because it's fucking awsome.Matthew McConaughey as the crazy American was awesome and hilarious in that movie. And it was well before his recent rise in popularity."
"He drinks from a flask throughout the movie, and then before the basically suicidal mission to kill the main dragon, he passes the flask around. Christian Bale takes a drink and they have this exchange:"
"> This is water!"
"> Keep it."
"Edit: And his entrance is great too.  When the Americans arrive part way through the movie, they do so in a big convoy of tanks.  Riding on top of one of the tanks, is a badass bald guy who looks like a fucking Viking.  It takes you a little bit to go, hold up, [*is that Matthew McConaughey*?!](http://i.imgur.com/cIoru4N.jpg)  And it totally is.  [And it's awesome.](http://i.imgur.com/sZX79p0.jpg)That is a quality lineI like when Christian Bale doesn't want to let Mat's character into his community with all his men and vehicles, so Matt says"
"We can do this the easy way, or we can do this the *real* easy way."
"I still say that every now and then.How have I never heard of this movie until now? McConaughey, Christian Bale, Gerard Butler AND Dragons?"
"I don't think Bale and Butler were big names yet ( not sure though).  And honestly if you don't like dragons you might think this movie kinda sucks.  I liked it a lot, but all my friends thought it was lame except for a few dragon scenes.  There's a really cool story telling scene that  if you like sci fi, you'll probably love.The reason these dragons rock is animation quality."
"To be clear: animation is the art of making something move like it's alive. It's not a catchall term for making CG shit. Just the movement, the acting of an animated character."
"Animation is fucking hard. Way harder than making a big scary dragon in Maya. Making a drawing or model move like a living being is the hardest thing to do convincingly that I've ever seen or tried. You basically have to be an amazing artist and an amazing actor to do it well, plus have a deep understanding of the anatomy and physiology and kinetics of whatever you're animating."
"Even as CG gets orders of magnitude better in every other way, animation quality is still entirely based on the skill of the animators."
"Reign of Fire was animated by pros, and they move like real animals. Which is why the dragona look better than all the HD rendered modern CG monsters that move like crippled hand puppets.I worked as an animation producer for two years and I could not agree more with what you're saying."
"I really always saw animators as actors. Animators have to perform and embody the characters that they're breathing life into, but they just do so through a model (either with a puppet, a CG model or with their pen), instead of in front of the camera."
"There seems to be a lack of understanding about how crucial performance is. We can improve textures and lighting as much as we want, but animation is everything.  Animation student here :)"
"Getting an animated creature to move as if it were real is one of the hardest things to do. You can make a dragon model as brilliant as Smaug, but it wouldn't be anything without researching how something like that would move (and Cumberbatch's performance, of course).[deleted]They blew their whole budget on those CGI shots. They ended up re-using some of the shots, they mask the dragon behind things during alot of his dialogue (waterfall)... It's really funny when you watch it knowing that each second of CGI cost them an arm and a leg.Only remind him always of his vow, Knight of the Old Code.Say what you will about the Hobbit movies as a whole, Smaug was incredibly well done. I'm not sure this tops that.You should see the short behind the scenes clip which sort of shows how Smaug was made. Truly fascinating."
"https://youtu.be/Pvr7DSEHcicFinally someone said the truth, and didn't just blindly shit on the moviesThe cg gold was shite thoughI remember a few moments in that movie in particular where I was like did they just run out of time?Actually if you look in the Behind the scenes, lots of gold is actually real not CGI. But if you are talking about the melted gold and the gold statue that almost kills Smaug then yes, it was very very shit.Yeah it looked like they were trying to shoot a velveeta commercialYeah that's what I meant the shitty looking gold looked like shit.When he busts out of the mountain and shakes it all off was awesome though. Yeah that is some of the worst CGI i've seen in major release in a long time."
"It really stands out in a movie that otherwise has excellent CGI."
"Still not as bad as the CGI dwarf in the 3rd movie."
"Hey guys lets make this one dwarf character CGI and have him interact with our amazing looking practical dwarf characters - i'm sure no one will notice."
"Between that and their baffling decision to randomly insert creatures from Guillermo del Toro's sketch book and Peter Jackson working his Dune pitch into the movie I found it to be the worst of the three."
"And while I could shit on these movies all day I don't *hate* them, I've seen them all multiple times on HBO now and still find myself watching them. They've got great casting and the scene where Smaug and Bilbo first meet brought part of my childhood to life... I loves and hates the hobbit trilogy as I loves and hates myself. That dwarf was cgi out of necessity. Billy connoly, the person who was supposed to play the part was very ill during filming so they made him in cgi so he could still do voice worm. [Deleted]Ok, then they get a pass on the CGI dwarf but there's no excusing everything else that was so horrid about the Hobbit movies including the fact that there were even three of them at all. Talk about stretching the material thin!It *almost* could've worked as three 90-minute movies...  but instead we got three movies with a total screen time of 474 minutes."
"Like butter scraped over too much bread, etc.Part of the problem is that they tried to add too many other books into the Hobbit in order to expand the lore, plus at least one subplot that is entirely original (and ill-fitting). Part of what made the Hobbit book great is that it was very self-contained and only hinted at a larger universe around it, so the parts they add to expand it really ruin the spirit of the narrative.> Ok, then they get a pass on the CGI dwarf"
"Fuck, no.  They had a hard decision, and they made the wrong one.  You *replace the actor* with another actor, not CGI.  Or you body double and put him in a helmet."
"A lot of things were messed up due to the three films thing. The whole Dragon chase scene wouldn't have existed without it- they needed a climax to film 2. Neither would the annoyingly long barrel riding scene, that was originally the climax to film one before the expansion."
"Everything that wasn't ruined by that was ruined but the 48fps thing because apparently that made practical effects look way worse and so they ended up painting over their practical orcs with cgi ones, plus a few other things. Then there was the fact that the source material isn't paced especially well for this sort of adaptation, and the additions they made with the white council didn't help."
"I maintain that there were great films there originally (2 would be ideal), but that one or two big bad decisions screwed over the rest of the process. I think it was pretty rushed by the end too, the first film is by far the best. I still think they could have made three movies work. There was more than enough material to make a trilogy there. It was the other choices that made it mediocre."
"For instance, I think Goblintown should have had more of a claustrophobic, horror feel. In the book I imagined dark narrow passages that only the goblins could navigate. In the film we got wide open, well lit spaces ending in a theme park chase. That and Beorn really upset me. THAT was their opportunity for levity, not Goblintown. > For instance, I think Goblintown should have had more of a claustrophobic, horror feel. In the book I imagined dark narrow passages that only the goblins could navigate."
"This is totally how the book made it feel when I was a kid. It was more like the Moria scenes in the Fellowship film in my mind.Honestly they could've just dubbed it and it would be less shitty. The scene with him covered in liquid gold flailing around absolutely left me gobsmacked. It looked incredible. In terms of the technology and how detailed he's rendered, sure. But I was 100% aware I was watching a computer animation even if it was pretty."
"Reign of Fire is one of the few movies with CG creatures that felt real to me. It's because of the animation."
"As someone who sucks ass at animation but has some experience with it: it's fucking hard. Making a drawing or a 3D model move like a living breathing creature is one of the hardest things there is in the world of art."
"There's a reason why even as our CG tech gets better and better, CG creatures still look fake and move like polio victims. And it's entirely because of animation quality.Starship Troopers (1997) was one movie that did it for me. Unlike some parts of Jurassic Park, the CG bug aliens blended in with the environment seemlessly even in daylight. The swarm was animated incredible too.> There's a reason why even as our CG tech gets better and better, CG creatures still look fake and move like polio victims. And it's entirely because of animation quality."
"It's also the reason video games still don't feel like they're making the leaps forward that they should be. You can mod the lighting in Skyrim until you're blue in the face, but the animation is still horrendous.Exactly. People take screenshots of heavily-modded GTAIV with exclamations of OMG look how lifelike it is! You can barely tell it's a video game!! But the second that image is viewed in motion, there'd be no question what you were looking at. He was. Although maybe a tad cartoonish. It did fit in with the tone and fantasy setting though.> cartoonish"
"Right up until the Tom & Jerry chase through the mines, he was the most menacing dragon to ever grace the screen. Shame how they treated him at the end.#INTENSE CLIMAX BUILDING UP HIS EVENTUALLY ATTACK ON LAKETOWN"
"^^Killed ^^10 ^^minutes ^^into ^^the ^^next ^^movie.That was a poor choice focusing entirely on having a cliffhanger for the next movie. Should have just kept going until his death at the end of the second movie, but I can see how that would leave people wondering what exactly was at stake for the final movie. It takes time to set up the conflict of the third segment.I said this some time ago, but the whole trilogy should have never been more than two movies, and the break point should have been the first movie ending with them getting into the barrels.  The 2nd movie could have started with them being pulled out in Laketown.It WAS originally going to be 2 movies.Tell that to New Line Cinema execs. They sign the cheques for those IMAX cameras (and barrel-mounted GoPros), and each of them wants a new holiday home in Greece with a yacht to go with it, so three movies it was"
"Not the only questionable choice in that trilogy. Alfrid is worse than Jar Jar Binks. At least he doesn't have an annoying and easy-to-replicate voice.He does if you're English ;) [deleted]I agree completely - at least Jar Jar Binks' screen time didn't come at the expense of established character development of the protagonist and main supporting cast. Most of the Dwarves never had a single line in the third movie and Bilbo's friendships (such as that with Bofur) were completely missed!"
"I never thought I would use the phrase At least Jar Jar Binks.....Jar Jar Binks played a key role in the story, whether you liked it or not. Alfrid just existed, he should have died with the Lake Master.Fun fact! Alfred dies a gruesome death in the extended edition. I almost cried it was so beautiful> trilogy"
"Questionable choice number 1I can understand not wanting to cram it all into one movie maybe, but I think it would have been best with just two. Have the first one get them all the way to Laketown and end with them looking at the mountain, and the next one focus on smaug and have the last 45-60 min be the battle of five armies."
"Movie looked amazing and fantastical, but I was so pissed when Smaug died in the first 20 minutes of the third movie.When Smaug reared up for that first breath of fire on Bilbo? Holy fucking shit. So damn scary. Very well done."
"Edit: [Smaug and Bilbo](https://youtu.be/IXmBnqkfD-w)That scene in the trailer where Smaug's eye  opened, and then _kept opening_, left me gobsmacked. The effect isn't the same now that I know what I'm looking at, but on first viewing, something about the sequence of the eyelid/nictitating membrane/iris movements really broke my sense of scale and proportion. That eye fucking _unfolded_. So perfect."
"Edit: right around the 45-second mark. https://youtu.be/jy-deJmRFIIIs this movie underrated or do I only remember it as good since I was a kid when I saw it?It's not fantastic but it's well up there, with a lot of gritty realism that doesn't jump the shark too bad... like every other survival horror movie ever."
"Friendly tension without you fuckin wot mate? moments. The survivalist aspect is pretty good.[Behind The Scenes - Reign of Fire: Breathing Life Into The Terror ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUK32Yi6oM&feature=youtu.be&t=2m19s)"
"This is a good video showing some of the post processing done for the movie.Reign of Fire will always have a special place in my heart simply because it introduced me to Mad at Gravity.they only released that one album didn't they?Yes, but it was amazing. A tragedy that that's all they ever released.ITT I learned more about the differences between dragons, wyverns, and drakes than I ever wanted to learn. Thanks, Reddit...Hey, that's doctor Bashir!"
"*checks IMDB*"
"Holy shit, that casting!Better is when you catch a Star Trek alien in a film, and only because they say a line and suddenly your ears go: Hey...that...that sounded like Quark/Garak/Gul-Dukat and low and behold it is!"
"Personal fav was realizing Quark was also the principle in Buffy (TV show, not movie)When the dragons look better than the fire they're breathing, you've gotten something right.  Especially for something that was made in 2002.That's quite a compliment, seeing as the majority of the fire effects were [real.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7-jkin4yts&t=12m50s)I'm sticking with TOOTHLESS.Bonus points for basically being a kitty with wings.Best overall is still Vermithrax Pejorative.[Dragonslayer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=796gyoCcf70) still has the best and most frightening dragon in my opinion.Have you seen the redone modern trailer a fan made for it?"
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu8vML5TPVE"
"And Vermithrax Pejorative is the best dragon name ever, just sounded so awe inspiring to me when I was an 11 year old."
"Is the movie really actually good or just bad-good or guilty pleasure-good? It's a really satisfying movie. It's pure entertainment but with lots of attention to detail and a clear labour of love.Damn, that scene with the Archangels is still just cool as hell. Nice post.I wish they hadn't put that stupid music over it. I want to be able to hear the dragons fucking things up, not watch them with some soundtrack where I feel like they should be seducing me.Wow 13 years feels like yesterday when this come out. Jurassic Park did the same kind of tricks as well to make the CGI look much more realistic.Best non-CGI dragon would have to be Vermithrax Pejorative from Dragonslayer!Why have I not seen or heard of this flick!?Compared to more recent stuff like Smaug in the Hobbit, the dragon in Harry Potter, and Game of Thrones... its visual and sound fx still holds extremely well after all those years. I would say only those in GoT are on par in terms of visuals."
"Only problem I had with their appearances in the movie was their lack of graphic violence, most likely because they had to deliver a PG-13 rating. Really needed more scenes of them eating and tearing shit up. Even the few times that does happen, it's often obscured by darkness and quick editing.The obscurity of the violence could've been budgetary constraints and/or directorial preference. I haven't seen Reign of Fire since it came out (I was pretty young and it freaked me out, but in a good way like LOTR). Really been needing another viewing."
"However, it's most likely due to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease that was spreading across Europe at the time. Wikipedia tells me that, many planned sequences could not be filmed due to restrictions.Give it another shot."
"I walked out of it in theaters, but saw it again last year and really, really liked it. Much better than I had been expecting.The last scene of s5 where she rides away on is looks *AWFUL.* Like, the background looks like a shitty greenscreen which it pretty much wasYou're right, that shot looked liked shite."
"The GoT parts I have in my head are the ones where the dragon barbecues the slave master when Daenarys got her army(?)."
"And the one where her now much bigger dragon swoops out of some hole and burns the shit out of some sheep.She looked like she was riding Falcor.Having the dragon in daylight and having to *directly* interact with a flesh and blood person is about the most difficult task the FX could have had."
"Also, Emilia Clarke failed to sell the emotion of that scene. I still don't know WTF she got an Emmy nomination for this year. Well the dragon looked fine, it was the background that just looked horrendousIt felt like that in more than one spot in s5. Might have been a time crunch on the last episode or last few.Drogon looks amazing in Mother's Mercy (ep10) though. They're wyverns, damn it!!! /s"
"They do still look great, but I wouldn't say they're the best, mainly because most of the shots are them in the dark or they're obscured. Even at the end, when you finally get a good shot of the dragons, it's still relatively dark. I would say the title of best CGI dragons goes to Game of Thrones, especially from the Dance of Dragons episode. When the dragon appears, it's in broad daylight and you can see every little detail in the dragon. It's gorgeous. Dammit Marie!Wyverns are venomous and don't breathe fire. AD&D MM pg. 102it's unfortunate that this movie didn't turn out that well. when my buddy pitched the premise to me, Matthew McConaughey in a tank VS dragons i really had i hopes for it*Game of Thrones spoiler* I've always thought the dragons in Game of Thrones are really well done.  Especially the later scenes of Drogon.Best CGI dragons on screen is like saying Best characters played by Robert Z'Dar. Some are better than others, but none are very convincing.Although Reign of Fire deserves praise it is second to the Hobbit by now. I am not actually that much of a fan of that Hobbit trilogy. It *does* feature the best CGI dragon though, it's one and only glorious accomplishment.Oh man you are 100% right. I love the movie and the Gamecube game is really well done too. The dragon physics are amazing.Reign of Fire is my favorite example of a movie that turned out to be awesome despite a terrible, ridiculous premise.For all the DnD rules lawyers that think they are passing on knowledge, here's a thought: it's a fictional creature that the filmmakers say are dragons, so it's a dragon."
"Literature, movies, video games, etc., and even the folklore and legends it's all based on, have reimagined monsters all the time. Put your Monster Manual away. People don't care. Oh shit, those weren't real?It loses points for me though for using American road signs in the UK.And yet they somehow made it a really boring movie.What's with the dumbass music?I loved the game of this movie as a kid, it'd probably suck if I played it now but back then I thought it was awesome Honor the country with heroes eh?! I say pity the one that needs em. [Dragonslayer](https://youtu.be/796gyoCcf70) was easily the best imo until Reign of Fire, considering it was made in 1981."
"[some of the various scenes with the dragon](https://youtu.be/HZ6v1xZdIS8) (weird source)What about the dragons in Game of Thrones?Best part of this movie was finding out about the band Mad at Gravity. They were fucking terrific.Has it been that long? God I feel so old.I never thought about it at the time, but looking back they do look really good.So glad I randomly saw this film while flipping through channels.Although you are mostly right. I still rank dragonheart as my all time favorite dragon."
"Oh and GoT has some seriously awesome dragons. I wanted the movie they advertised, dragons versus the airforce but no i didn't get that....And it's a fantastic post-apocalyptic movie that always gets way too little credit imo.I love teh concept of that movie but it's so poorly directed, paced and scripted."
"Also I thought it was Mcconaughey's performance was odd at the time (not used to seeing him that transformed & badass in role then) and now it's the McConaughey normal.This movie has seriously mixed reviews, but I genuinely enjoyed it.Shit I can't believe I was fucking 7 when I first saw this movie. I remember friends and I would take turns being a dragon after my dad took us to see it. I definitely didn't see it then but I for damn sure see now, how underrated this amazing movie is! I can't wait to watch it again after I find my DVD. THANK YOU OP for bring back an awesome part of my childhood! No problem. Its a pretty cool trip down memory lane for me too:) Was 12 when it came out.Is this movie any good?No. It's amazing. Well worth a watch despite the plot.This movie is awesome and ill fist fight anyone who disagreesAlso the funniest death scene I have ever watched for Matt McConaughey in this movie.Such a great movie. Top 10 for me. I need to watch this again because when I did then, I was a kid and found it boring af. But I've always had this in the back of my mind because I don't remember much other than dragons, Matty looking like a badass viking and Batman in it. I don't understand why people hated this movie so much.Barrel riderReign of Fire is, by a long way, my favorite movie plot to describe to other people."
"In this movie, the cycle of extinction on earth is controlled by A BUNCH OF DRAGONS THAT POP OUT OF THE GROUND AND BURN EVERYTHING TO DEATH!This movie was far better than given credit all around. I have seen it probably 20 times and I still enjoy it every time. Especially the scene where he jumps off with the axe straight at the dragon!I think the Hobbit had a better CGI dragon with Smaug, he was badass, but this is definitely the second best CGI dragons. and very impressive for 13 years before the hobbit."
"I have to admit the dragon animation in Reign of Fire was realistic enough to largely compensate for a fairly low quality plot."
"For my money the coolest individual dragon is the one in Goblet of Fire that chases Harry Potter across the rooftops. They really captured the feel of a dragon as an extremely dangerous enraged animal. Not better than Smaug thoughIt really rates up there with me when it comes to a post-apocalypse movie. The dragons are the cause of our near-extinction. How cool is that for a story?"
"The movie is actually really good. It doesn't deserve such a low rating. It's original, fun and there are a buttload of excellent actors in this that make the movie still hold up today. Plus the effects held up perfectly. To me, it's an 8/10."
"Plus, with remakes and sequels galore, this movie deserves better recognition than it's getting."
"It really is one of those movies I'm hoping comes out with a decent sequel. Or none, to preserve how good this one is."
"Are there any better dragon movies out there like this? None, in my book.This was the first dark post-apocalyptic movie I ever watched. People back then weren't used to a movie being that grey I think. It's only later that we accepted it as a stylistic choice. The Road was pretty grey and depressing too.Probably because they are still the best CGI dragons ever on screen. Best overall is still Vermithrax Pejorative.Is it considered a dragon if it doesn't have at least four legs? I see too many dragons represented as two wings and two legs which is more representative of wyverns. Dragons should walk on four legs and have two wings as well, but i guess they cut out the legs for budget?It's a real underrated movie.  I only got to appreciate it on a re-run about a month ago. Stayed up to watch it and was in awe at how well done the cgi is, especially for when it was made.What is so special about these dragons? Visually, they are almost always drenched in shadows and we never actually get a clear, detailed shot.Even better than the Jurassic World CGI dinosaurs.  Hell, even the 1995 Jurassic Park had better CGI than Jurassic World.Apparently didn't see Smaug in the LotR movie.I love this damn movie and I'm actually disappointed that I haven't watched it in a while now. If I recall correctly, there was a PS2 game for this where you could play as the dragons, including the Bull. Not a particularly good game overall, but damn, playing as a giant dragon was satisfying.  I dunno, Smaug could give them a run for their moneyThat movie made zero fucking sense. Just like your Mom."
"But, I fukt her anyway.i really enjoyed this movie. it doesn't have great rating, but i think my opinion is right and those who don't like it are wrong. lolSays who?"
"My vote is for How to Train Your Dragon.In a similar way, Firefly still has some of the best spaceship CGI of any tv show.I don't remember anything remarkable about the show's CGI, it was Serenity that really nailed it."
"Either way, Battlestar Galactica is king for television space CGI.It was good, but I thought Battlestar Galactica outdid it on a regular basis.  Those look like wyverns to me.Trogdor the Burninator would like a word with you. There goes the countrysideFuuuuck I remember this movie, I think I remember loving it too. I'm surprised at how impressive it still is but I can't believe I forgot it existed.As someone who works in VFX, I feel like these scenes, while they have aged well, are pretty dated in the animation of the dragons. There's not the muscle and skin interaction you'd see in a film nowadays. I'd venture to say the dragon in the Deathly Hallows was much more photoreal, especially as we see it much more clearly in much more brightly lit, clear scenes. These shots do still look great for their age, though.I'm surprised someone who works in VFX doesn't even know what the word animation means."
"Animation is the acting of the CG character. The movement. That's literally the best part of Reign of Fire, and the reason why the dragons look so good."
"All the skin folding and muscle deformation contributes, but ultimately it's tech, and the most realistically built dragon with all the bells and whistles still looks like shit if it doesn't move right. Which is why most CG looks fake even with ridiculous levels of detail and realism in the model and tech.People in and out of the industry also use the term animation in a broad sense, especially when not conversing within the industry.Right, but you're comparing cgi tech in its early stages in 2002 versus 2011 for Harry Potter."
"For me, while the animations do look realistic in Harry Potter, the whole shots being in brightly lit, clear scenes actually takes me out of the scene because it just looks like the three of them hanging on some small prop in front of a green screen. The dragon sticks out so much from the picture imo.What's great about Reign of Fire is they knew how to hide the CGI with editing and set design. Umm. Did people like this movie?"
"The CGI was great, but the movie itself? I thought it was terrible... I like it but I love dragons so I'm biased that way.  eight year old me *loved* this movieAs a child i loved Dragons being awesome and badassIt's not an entirely brainless action flick. I care for some of the characters, and the shit situation they are all in. It's about badass dragons to boot, and there's honestly not very many dragon movies to begin with, let alone good ones. Sure, it's far from perfect but it's still pretty entertaining in the end. I don't see how any movie with Wooderson, The King of Sparta, Dr. Bashir and Batman  could be bad. EVER.I mean sure, the acting and dialogue were often times over the top but the whole concept , the settings, and effects were great in my opinion."
"Dragons in post apocalyptic modern England/London vs Batman and Wooderson. Who wouldn't like that?Its like Skyrim and Fallout had a baby.It is the Citizen Kane of post-apocalyptic British dragon-sploitaion films."
"All film students will study this tour de force.I enjoyed the setting, definitely.I *wanted* to like it, does that count?"
"Had some great conceptual ideas. Pretty forgettable execution though.Exactly! I remember getting really excited, and then feeling blank after watching it.Yep, watching these clips makes me wanna watch it again, but I remember how I felt at the end of it and now I'm unsure.I enjoyed it. What I really liked about them is how they breath fire. You see some sort of liquid being expelled which gets ignited after a while. It looks really cool."
"Aside from that they aren't really dragons but wyverns.Can you explane the diffrence between a dragon and a wyvern?It's entirely dependent on the world's lore. Dragons have four legs, Wyverns have the bat wing/arm combo thing going on and only two legs."
"But it's also a real fucking stupid argument because it's fantasy, so if the creators want to call them dragons they can call them dragons.[Wyverns](http://images-cdn.9gag.com/photo/aNKdVp6_700b.jpg)A wyvern is just a type of dragon though. Its a general termThey're called dragons in the movie. Seeing as it's not a real animal that makes them dragons.Here's the thing...I promise there are people who would fight you over thisYO!Here's the thing. You said a wyvern is a dragon."
"Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that."
"As someone who is a scientist who studies dragons, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls wyverns dragons. If you want to be specific like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing."
"If you're saying dragon family you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Draconem, which includes things from hydras to basilisks to drakes."
"So your reasoning for calling a wyvern a dragon is because random people call the two-legged ones dragons? Let's get serpents and nagas in there, then, too."
"Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A wyvern is a wyvern and a member of the Dragon family. But that's not what you said. You said a wyvern is a dragon, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the Dragon family dragons, which means you'd call basilisks, hydras, and other Draconem dragons, too. Which you said you don't."
"It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"
"I have to know, are you being serious right now? Currently on an expedition to Argolis to uncover the remains of the Lernaean Hydra.God fucking dammit."
"For those who are confused, /u/KINGWST is parodying the [comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/2byyca/reddit_helps_me_focus_on_the_important_things/cjb2z41) that got legendary redditor /u/Unidan banned last year.Ah... you mean best wyverns right? Dragons have four legs. Yes you may make fun of me now.I both love and hate this movie. I love it for combing the post apocalyptic genre with dragons. Seriously, no other movie has done this. It's mostly zombies. The dragons look great, and as /u/mrdinosaur pointed out, it's because of how their scenes are shot."
"However, the biggest problem with this movie is the story. It was good until the later half when just 3 people are able to take out the Alpha Male. Also, there's only one male. What did he fuck? The trailer even questions how they went from 1 to a million in less than a year, but the scene was cut. Also, the [poster.](http://www.impawards.com/2002/posters/reign_of_fire.jpg) Not once do you see anything that's displayed on the poster in the film. It would have been great to see a flashback of this occurring to see how devastating dragons can be to a modern military."
"Overall, the movie's just meh. Not bad, but could have been so much better.Nice write up, but considering the time, I feel dragon slayer was right up there. Stop action and all.100% agree. Love that movie. Though not CGI.Hence ''best CGI'' in the title. The one in Dragonslayer was entirely done with models and animatronics."
"Just realized the effects in that movie were by Industrial Light and Magic. No wonder the dragon still holds up looks-wise.The dragons did look excellent ... Too bad the rest of the movie is total garbage.While this is amazing and the hobbit movies are pretty meh, I still think smaug trumped these ones cgi-wise. Smaug was one of the only redeeming qualities of the new hobbit movies and he was perfect. I agree that those are some really nice looking dragons. I also liked the dragon in Dragonheart but to me the best looking one are the one from games of thrones but they have 12 years of technology over on reign of fire. I read a review that said the dragons didn't look convincing. Lol. Hate the movie all you want but the dragons were well done and the reviewer lost all credibility the moment she included that critique.Their flight is so off though. They move way too fast and their motion doesn't seem realistic. Their paths don't really flow and it doesn't match their wing motions well.>Best CGI dragons ever on screen"
"What? Did you not watch any of the Hobbit movies? Smaug's CGI was top notch and put this to shame."
"I don't deny that the movie has fans or is an interesting take on the concept of dragons, but if the question is dragon quality, Smaug is amazing.As a kid when this movie came out, it will forever be, Hey kid, ya like dragons? Ya like Apache helicopters and tanks? *Ya wanna see em fight?!* lol well all that stuff already happened here are some smelly dudes in a castle."
"So disappointed.I love Reign of Fire, but those are not true dragons. They would be more of wyverns. The difference being the number of legs and the lack of more auxiliary mystical characteristics like talking. When too many gather in one place, the blood boils. Amazing filmDefinitely some cool looking dragons.  Plus the use of real fire helps.  I know for sure in the scene when he blows fire at the vehicle it was a tractor that shoots out fire in its place.A bit off topic, but is this movie any good? I've heard a bit about it when I was younger, but I never saw it.It's a decent watch if you haven't seen it. Pretty predictable from a plot standpoint, but entertaining. I'd say a 6.5 - 7/10.I totally forgot about this movie! It use to be one of my favorites as a child, along with Godzilla (and hate what you want, as a kid, that movie was Kick ass) but I can never remember the name of this movie! But this made me remember and now I want to find it somewhere to watch it again!!! Thank you /u/G0biasCan't really hate Godzilla, I'm too fond of the animated series with zilla Jr kicking major ass. Goddamn I forgot how much I loved this film.  The technique they did for the fire was cool.  McConaughey before he was a thing.  Bale before Batman.[KATLA!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1y5Viz2EsA)I don't know if it has the best Dragon CGI, but it is one of if not the best Dragon movies.i don't know if best, but they *were* good looking."
"didn't really like the movie though, barely made an impression so i don't really remember the plot evenI haven't seen anyone mention the dragon scene from [Sucker Punch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dobvRk_QP8o). Pretty minor part of the movie but it was awesome.I will always remember this movie as the first movie I ever saw on DVDThere was a video I remember seeing on why older CGI looked better than more recent CGI. I think it had something to do with the background and environment that the CGI was animated over. Older CGI animations were over film of real life settings and it made it seem more realistic. They used the original Hulk from 2003 or something and compared it to the newer Hulk movies, the newer ones looked so fake because the entire background was CGI as well and it all looked so artificial. In this movie the dragon and the fire are the only things that are CGI and it makes it look much more believable.How do they fly with so many holes in their wings?[NO NO NO FUCK THAT SHIT.](https://youtu.be/lD-pR0SuhNY?t=5m15s)"
"This film looks great, considering watching it."
"Edit: This channel makes some great content, [Spoilers for Attack the Block, brilliant.](https://youtu.be/fHSuA0ersTU?t=14m2s)What about game of thrones?Why does it as high as quality as other dragons of today's movies, like smaug?  Is it a budget thing?  It kind of pisses me off when today's movies scrimp on dragon effects when a movie from 2002 fucking kills it.I think what sells the CGI (in addition to the muddied look) is the CGI shots being spliced with practical effects in camera (just like Jurassic Park)."
"For example, in the sequence around [3:30](https://youtu.be/lD-pR0SuhNY?t=3m30s), the shot of the CGI dragon crashing to the ground, dust filling the screen, and then coming back to where we last saw the dragon and seeing the man walking around the practical dragon on the set, giving the allusion of it being one shot.Hey, BashirI offer no discussion to this thread but I know the guy who owns this Channel, cool, cool guy.I am blown away that this movie is already 13 years old. It feels like it came out like 5 - 6 years ago.I dunno, I'd argue for How to Train Your Dragon.It was good but i think it would have been better if it had ended with the black screen at 4 min.I think how to train your Dragon did it better /sExcept that moment at 1:11 where it looks like a fucking chipmunk. This is a fav of mine for a long time. Only problem I ever had with it was the proportions. The male was shown to be HUGE compared to the females from a distance. But then close up he just looked moderately larger. Always bugged me. Otherwise I loved it. Never seen the movie, but what I really took away from this clip is how fast and natural the movements are. In a lot of movies big creatures move very slowly and cumbersomely. But these guys are like big cats in that they're actually nimble and fast.Completely unrelated, but the Reign of Fire video game on PS2 was amazing as well. After you beat the game, you got to replay it from the dragons' point of view which was mind blowing. I thought the dragons in the 5th season of Game of Thrones were very well done as well.You know what was weird about that film in terms of effects? I recall that the effectd *were* particularly good and I appreciated it and I guessed it also must have been quite a difficult abd expensive technical enterprise and they did welk quite consistently throughout the film too...."
"Except forone shot. It seened like such a weird shot to mess up because it was one that as an outsider I assumed would have been one of the 'easier' shots."
"The shot in question involves someone standing on top of a water tower, brandishing a weapon at the dragons flying by. It's filmed top down with the character barreling the lens. Evidently for safety or budget ir whatever other reason, the actual platform the actor was standing in would seem to have been much lower to the ground than the story and prior shots would imply, so they'd superimposed a background to make it seem a lot higher. This would be fine but for whatever reason it was done terribly. It was comically bad I just couldn't understand it. I believe it was some pivotal story moment too so it wasn't a shot you could get away with screwing up even if it didn't have any dragons and should have been less demanding. Very odd, very jarring."
"Great film though.Halo music lmao The castle scenes were filmed in glendalough in southeast Ireland. I'd one of the most beautiful places in the county. My dad took me to see the set.and it holds the record for the first time I ever fell asleep during a movie.So nice! Good video.This movie is actually so damn good too.  Whoa this movie is from 2002? I watched it like a year ago and thought it had just came out. Is the movie really actually good or just bad-good or guilty pleasure-good? is it just entirely too expensive these days for movie makers to create actual creature props to try to create more believable creatures? i'm thinking like the dinos in jurassic park. i know that there was plenty of cgi in that movie too, but many scenes relied on the actual dino props to give the creatures more authenticity."
"obviously flying creatures are farr far more difficult to create, but i still think the dinosaurs in jurassic park looked the most real to me.. i just wish we'd see more movies like that these days."
"i'd also like to add that i thought the dragons in game of thrones were very well done.Real effects, though cost more(marginally) last longer on film. That and you don't pay someone everythime you have have them rendered on film. To just easier/faster.  Horror films are notorious for this now. Cheap cgi and lack luster blood. I'll never understand why in movies when people think there's something behind them they turn around all slow"
"I'd look so fast I'd break my neck trying to see what's behind meBy who? who's giving out these weird titles?The soundtrack sounds like a precursor to [*Time*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxabLA7UQ9k)! (And not just the four-chord sequence--the melodies played on top are similar as well.)The dragons did look great, though I recall thinking that the movie was being very inconsistent with the size of the male dragon from scene to scene. (Needed a name, BTW), Ah Reign of Fire... You know I thought that movie sucked but I loved the visuals.Those are some sexy dragons!Dragons, alright, alright, alright..what about the dragon from the qualcomm commercialI really need to see this movie in its entirety. The CGI is definitely spot on. I saw Goosebumps the other night and thought about how CGI seems to be less realistic the better they get with it. It stands out like a sore thumb vs blending in with its real life scenery. Watching now,  not bad 40 min inThe song at the beginning sounds so familiar, but I can't put a name to it, anyone know?I need to rewatch this. It's been a long while. I like to talk about this movie with strangers as though I believe it's a documentary. As such, I loved this post.balerion the dread.Anyone have the name of the song/the artist it's by? This song is amazing.Still one of my favorite movies to this day.What is the music that's heard at the absolute end of the video?I had *just* finished listening to Time by Hans Zimmer before watching this and the music for the first 3/4 minutes sounds *exactly* like it! Does anyone else think this?13 years later, the soundtrack still sounds like a Nolan film.How have I never even heard of this movie?Fire effects sure have come a long way though. The star wars bit was fantastic, and Bale and McConaughey are great...but I remember really disliking this move in general.  (Only ever watched it once when it came out).  Should probably give it another shot.I always thought this movie looked dumb. Then I caught it on cable a few years ago, boy was I missing out on a cool movie. !RemindMe 30 minutesMessaging you on [**2015-11-02 02:34:28 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2015-11-02 02:34:28 UTC To Local Time) to remind you of [**this.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3r4c8b/13_years_laterreign_of_fire_still_holds_title_for/cwl423a)"

"|-|-|-|-|-|what bothered me about that film/scenes was how the dragons changed sizes.. at one point his wing span is longer and larger than the london tower and parliament than smaller etc etc.IMO it's too bad the movie was lousy.First few minutes into the film: We've hit a void."
"Ummm, what?.....Is it weird that this post apocalyptic world with Christian Bale turned out far better than the post apocalyptic world in Terminator Salvation?And I still fuckin love that movie..the game though...fuck that game...so hard..Oh jesus, you just reminded me I've never been able to completely watch this movie as a kid due to a scratch on my DVD that froze at a certain point."
"I know what I'm watching tonight I was JUST remembering how much I loved this film as a kid. Looking it up today it appears it wasn't received as well as I thought, but man was the visuals in this film great.I always felt like it deserved more cult status than it got... Between Matthew McConoughey's unhinged scenery chewing performance, badass dragon effects and crazy action scenes, I found it really memorable.6:20"
"WITNESSYup. Haven't watched this in ten years. Time to watch it again.yes, my tattoo artist had a different design in mind when I came by to look at his first draft for one of my tattoos.  Showed him english mythological dragon designs, and asked him to watch reign of fire.  Second draft was much better than the puff the magic dragon first draft.And the greatest Rifftrax. I've seen this movie a dozen times with Mike and Co making fun of it. Get a shot of my chiseled arms.It also happens to be Matthews best movie, in a guys perspective."
"Usually he's annoying, shirtless, sexy, and laughing."
"This time he's a badass Viking like dragon slaying mother fucker....whose still shirtless. This is my favorite least-known movie of all time."
"It has a solid cast, great atmosphere, amazing visuals, and a unique story."
"I'm going to watch it this week. This movie has some of my favorite CGI except that one damn green screen at the end. You know the oneThat made me quite sad.Too bad the movie was a snoozer. Had such potential.No love for Dragonslayer? Most of effects were practical though I think nonetheless outstandingThe movie's fun and all, but... best CG dragons?  They do a decent  job hiding the shortcomings with shadows most of the time but, now that you've drawn my attention to it, it's got really dated effects."
"Also, the melancholy piano music in that video is bewilderingly out of place.That movie is a masterpiece. They deserve it. Yes, I love that movie. Well, for the dragons at least. The plot...not so much.As much as Eragon sucked as a movie, I thought they did a pretty good job with Saphira. This movie will always be one of my favorites. The first time I watched Reign of Fire, it was a rental from Blockbuster. I seen the beginning and the end, but the DVD skipped somewhere in between, resulting in a 35 minute movie."
"I missed everything, and had the ending ruined for me, so I haven't given it a true shot.Don't forget this [awesome song](https://youtu.be/GmB3oaQa3FA) from the movie.When I was 12 I went to the movies to kill some time before mum finished work,   I'd heard about a cool movie with dragons, but I'd forgotten the name."
"I looked at the board and saw 'Red Dragon' -  'That must be it!, and there is a showing soon!' I thought, hurridly buying a ticket and lying about my age."
"Oh how wrong I was...."
"I also consider them to have the most impressive prop of a dragon i've seen. I watched the bonus features a long time ago, and the fire breathing dragon head looked terrifyingly real."
"Also it's one of the first times i've ever seen somebody actually design/explain the firebreathing aspect, instead of fire building up in the body/throat to be spat at people, they explained it by a mix of naturally produced chemicals that it spits out and reacts by creating fire. [haven't seen it] I actually thaught it was the trailer and realized it wasn't half way throguh13 YEARS LATER?! Honestly seems like 4-5 years ago to me (30m).Really really well done, especially given how long ago it was filmed. But I really don't think this beats The Hobbit's Smaug. Obviously they had recent technology and all the money in the world, but still...Matthew McConaughey's death in this movie was one the most memorable for me.  I'd never seen someone who was pretty much a main character die in a glorious moment where you thought there might be a chance for him to kill it.  Even if it was unrealistic for him to win with an ax against a huge dragon.How have I never seen this movie?after seeing your post i watched reign on fire again. what a great movie!The game was also pretty cool and was basically halo vehicle controls + dragons Did anyone else play the Reign of Fire video game as a kid? I used to love it.Those are wyverns you pleb. I'm jk. What can be considered dragon? strictly don't they need four legs and wings, unless chinese? If you want to use loose terms couldn't godzilla be considered a dragon? He's semi intelligent, can breathfire/atomic breath, and reptilian. I thought his cgi was amazing. what's that song at the end from?I would have loved a sequel to this This movie is really badass. Dragons were super well done and the characters were good. Honestly wish it could have been a franchise or something. Haven't had a movie that scratches the dragon itch since then.Envy the country that has heroes!!!  ' I say 'pity the country that needs em'You can still tell the difference between this and a real dragon though Can someone tell me what the song is that's playing in this video? I know I recognize it from something, but I can't put my finger on it. Thanks a bunch!Pretty sure the first song is from the Inception OST (if not it sounds very similar), not sure about the secondThis movie rarely gets the recognition it deserves. It's one of my favorites.Needs a keep of kalessin sound trackThey did such a great job showing scale in realistic settings and situations.First movie I saw in theaters as a kid, good shit.Oh, no. This was filmed with real dragons.Yeah, I just watched it for the first time tonight and it's fucking sick.for a 2002 movie it was fucking legitThere's a reason for that. Nowadays effects projects are sold off to the lowest bidder. Here's a very interesting read on the company behind the reign of fire effects. http://www.aintitcool.com/node/12700talk about burning dow THATCHED ROOF COTTAGES!"
"TROGDOR Is this something that's voted upon? Also is there an actual title belt?The way CGI is done right: enhancing or grounded in a physical shot. Great film.What movie had the best non-cgi Dragons?I'mma let you finish, but The Pagemaster had the most visually and scientificically realistic CGI dragon of all time.how come i never saw this?The dragon looks beast, but sometimes the fire looks hella fake.Anyone remember Eragon? Blargh. I loved that film when I was a teenager. Bale and Matt McC do a great job. I still struggle not to see Matt McC as anything but a beefy ignorant American soldier since this was the first role I'd ever seen him in and he did such a good jobSo this is a pretty good movie right. Cause Batman's in it?This just makes me miss Game of Thrones. Excuse me while I rewatch thisSo I know this isn't a movie exactly... But, my vote for best CGI dragons comes from right here - https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ylFzJ3wRgHwIs this from Dark Souls?I just watched this for the 1st time tonight. I guess in my head I head I had thought this movie was based off the book Eragon which I know is universally despised."
"Was a good movie. Thank you. I personally think that the nazgul's dragons were better looking and more convincing....Persons pass on this film a lot of bullshit however when i was a child this was one of the best noteworthy films for me....Really? I thought the Dragonheart dragon was always superior....especially considering the time.......I always loved the sense of speed of the dragons conveyed in the movie, especially those panning shots seen from a distance as they fly over landscapes. It looks very believable because of the large size and wingspan, and the realistically-animated movements.As a monster hunter fan, I can't help but think of carving up that dragon. The title card said this was a monster analysis; but what exactly were they analyzing? It was just footage from the movie with somber piano music, followed by footage of the movie with upbeat orchestration. They didn't really analyze anything."
"Don't take this the wrong way I'm just curious why they called it that if it is not that.That movies scared the shit out of me when I was 7.I don't know about the best...This move was... well-doneThere is not enough good dragons in TV or cinema. I have high hopes for Drogon though! His character arc from little baby dragon to man eating and burninating is really inspiring stuff so far!Loved those dragons. They were my first CGI dragons. You always cherish your first.I am in complete agreement.  I remember the first time I saw this movie and thought, HELL. YES.  *That* is a dragon![deleted]I remember hearing that the dragons were not finished for the movie due to budget cuts. Anyone know if it's true?I wish the dragons had arms, I love the way they're portrayed in this, but I've always liked my dragons to have arms instead of just wings ala bats. IMO, What you don't show of a monster is more important than what you do show. The mind can make it far scarier.[sarcasm] there only has been like, 98 dragon movies released since then.. hold on, McConaunaghey and Bale in a modern age dragon survival movie with good CGI?  holy shit, how have I never heard of this.  I'm gonna watch the hell outta this.Textures are not high enough in resolutionI don't know about the best, the Game of Thrones ones are pretty damn cool, almost similar to these.Agreed. This movie was great. The reign of fire game was awesome. In the campaign you could choose to be a dragon or human.Well this movie is amazing so I'm not even surprised Saw this movie instead of xXx (2002) and my friends made fun of me for going to watch a Dragons movie.  If only they made a science based mmorpg based on dragons like this. criminally underrated movie.  The movie is damn near perfect and has a forty percent on rotten tomatoes.  Incredible performances from Christian Bale and matthew mcconaughey"
"That was the book. That's honestly the same surprise I felt reading the book. Skydiving to net a dragon in English fog.Even this can't save it for me. I saw a huge display for it before it was released with Apache gunship helicopters on it... Awesome - massive choppers vs dragons aerial dogfights!!!"
"Nope. Nope. Not even."
"Every time I see a Don't pirate movies add I think We'll don't f**kn lie about what is going to be in the movie! Give me my money back you wankers!!!I saw this in theatres as a kid. I loved it. I was just at the age where I was catching onto Hollywood tropes, especially how literally every movie has a love story. Every. Single. One. I was hoping this could be the one. The only one where a woman and a man could have a platonic relationship and see each other as equals. Nope. The very last minute some fuckhead producers forced the director to put the main characters holding hands. Motherfuck. That guy in the wingsuit netting the dragons up was very Attack on Titan-esque. What a badass."
"I actually really liked the scene in the movie where the humans driven underground are re-enacting The Empire Strikes Back for the kids.Quite fond of this film because it was filmed about 5 minutes from my family home. I remember the spotlights and explosions when they were making it. Sword of Xanten had quite a good dragon (especially considering the low budget).Reign of Fire, while decent at best, is the only film I've ever fell asleep in, while viewing in the theater. I was like... 14.anyone know where I could find the music that is played in the beginning?I list all music in my video descriptions. Maybe I'm just watching the wrong movies but only other movies I can think of right now that actually have dragons in them are the Hobbit and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (and How To Train Your Dragon but that doesn't really count)Dragonheart, Harry Potter: Deathly Hallows, Sucker Punch, Eragon, LOTR (i know, i know, wyverns, but wtv), Beowulf. Bunch of other B-movies like DnD also out there.RUN LIKE THE WIND BAABAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!."
"Reign of Fire is on my repeat viewing list. Right along side The Mummy, 13th Warrior, Big Trouble Little China, etc. Not cinema perfection, but something I can always have playing when I want to relax."
"Did it just turn into a bird around 1:38 lol"
"From a techincal/CGI perspective, I'd say it's far from the best. The thing that makes it good is the camera angels and how little you see the dragon which helps hide the actual quality of the model.Error at [7:03](https://youtu.be/lD-pR0SuhNY?t=7m3s): dude went into the air before the flame burst.Game of Thrones >>>As against the best real dragons?man I remember watching this movie as a teen. I didnt know its been 13 years already.I dunno. I mean. It looks good for 13 years old yeah.The number of leechers, for this film, just rocketed on KAT.Even now they're still so much better done than the crap in Game of Thrones. I'd love to see a sequel to this movie done with as much skill as the original. I never understood how the dragon killed his mother.Are you talking about the beginning of the movie? http://i.imgur.com/dunuduL.jpg I loved this movie back when I first watched it on demand."
"Didn't know of anyone else who even knew about it but I'm glad its got some recognition.So that's where they got the way the Skyrim dragons moved.Loved it as a childIs the movie really actually good or just bad-good or guilty pleasure-good? For me most CGI flying creatures (usually dragons I guess) are in the some uncanny valley - I guess either because their wings are two fucking small for their body (if a dragon wants to lift his skeleton with the size of a tyrannosaurus rex he better has some mighty wings) OR because they move either on a perfect line through the air while flapping their wings hard or the opposite - move crazy up and down while doing it."
"...Gliding shots are basically always fine - but even here in Reign of Fire they kinda hide their dragons flapping (only close ups and so on)...the first (and so far last?) movie which did convincing wing flapping (for me) was Avatar (including landing scenes and so on) -  but for that you needed fucking James Cameron deciding that it was time to render a movie about nature completly in a server farm.Hey, that's doctor Bashir!"
"*checks IMDB*"
"Holy shit, that casting!Christian Bale has intimated in interviews that he only made this movie to put food on the table, but I've always liked it.The music is very similar to the one in the Inception. BUT SMAUG THO pity the movie is so average though"
"can't suspend the disbelief of the dragons being hard to kill... when they get killed fairly easily in the movie.Dragons have 4 legs and wings. This one is a drake (2 legs and wings that they walk with)Pretty sure a Drake is considered a Dragon too, just a different type. Music really ruined this.Is that the original music? anybody else feel like it HAD to be an inspiration for the track from Inception? O.OThere is jacked up Matthew Mcconaughey and all you noticed and excited about are cgi dragons? BRING DOWN THE BEAST!!!Have you *seen* the live action [Skyrim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfCEbkksgCU) trailer?So, I should watch this then? Sold, added to list.gosh those dragons are assholesI dunno man, for the year it came out Dragon heart had good cgi. Especially the scene where the dragon swims in the lake. That was coolMy favorite scene from the movie was when they were in the castle reenacting The Empire Strikes back, and all the kids had the same reaction to [Star Wars spoiler](#s Darth Vader being Luke's father).It also has the title for best theatrical adaptation of star wars of any movie ever."
"This movie has tanks and attack helicopters and dragons, would have been very hard not to make an awesome movie.That part at the end gave me shivers all over. Damn, that was good. I'd never heard of reign of fire but I'll sure check it out now.My problem with this movie is that the surviving humans are using such feeble weapons. An RPG would make quick work of a dragon, but then you wouldn't have a movie.He was driving a Lincoln long before it was cool to slay dragons...I Think So..."
"Now, we can watch [Reign of Fire](http://cinema.vibomov.com/streaming-online/6278/reign-of-fire.html) again...the close combat scenes towards the end look bad and fake though.I saw it again just last week for the first time in many years, and I confirm that it defintiely stands the test of time. I had forgotten it was *13 years old* though.How come no one has commented on Matthew McConaugheys character's death at the end?  I would've hoped for a more epic death given how epic he was throughout the movie.  Or maybe it was just to match the craziness he portrayed, as well.If you thought that was good, you should watch Dragon Slayer from 1981 and see what they did 34 years ago.I still haven't got a clue what the whole plan was with the 3 transmitters and the people skydiving out of the helicopter. It seems like there would be any number of much better ways to kill a dragon that weren't so prone to everyone involved dying.I would totally counter that with the dragon from the dragons layer movie from the 80s is way better I used to be an adventurer like you, but then I took a dragon spit to the face.Always enjoyed this film! Great cast: Gerrard Butler, Batman, and ripped Rust Cohle! Also the reenacting of Star Wars was hilarious.I always thought to myself that this movie had some pretty good visuals for its day."
"I remember watching it in theaters at 12 years old and being blown away, loved that movie and I'm surprised I haven't re watched itGames of Thrones should've hired this CGI person.This is what I try to explain when people scoff at me for saying how trash the Game of Thrones dragons lookWhere's the analysis?Man I played the game for this before I saw the movie."
"The first dragon swooped down and panic ensued. That game was so fuckin hard sorry to interrupt your little........ soiree...It also helps that a lot of the shots aren't shaky cam.  You get to see everything framed nicely in decently long shots.  Today everything is cheaply hack and slashed together on what looks like a handicam.I dont know, i think Smaug look betterPretty sure that the reason this still, and forever will, hold the title for best CGI dragons is because they used real dragons. Duh. However, dragons are no longer around in the world, or so we know, so there probably won't be a sequel. Unless they find more dragons. So, maybe instead of fund a kickstarter for the movie, you should fund a kickstarter for a dragon rescue and restore team.My favorite touch was that they re-enacted Star Wars for story time. It makes me wonder what else they were acting out for the kids. Probably not the prequels.the idea that dragons were responsible for the extinction of dinosaurs was interestingSmaug was neat, and talking dragon! With snide remarks and condescending humor Game of Thrones thoughThey're not true dragons. They're wyverns. No forelegs you see. However they are well shot, and the movie captures how deadly an opponent they would be.The whole dragon vs. wyvern thing is seriously the most pedantic, pointless nerd internet battle I've ever seen in my life. This thread is such a circle jerk.And apparently you're the referee.I honestly don't think these dragons look any better than the dragons in other movies. The least convincing thing about that film was the idea that a modern military wouldn't have been able to handle dragons. I mean even before we get all fancy... we have Vulcan cannons and miniguns... they work REALLY, REALLY well.Most police forces would probably have enough fire power to kill a dragon. Just get a few snipers and shoot it's wings."
"Don't fuck with humans. We are the most destructive species this planet has ever seen. Also, the worst movie ever....."
"As much as I despise the Hobbit films, Smaug is definitely better from a technological standpoint. Calling these the best CGI dragons is like saying Halo 3 has better graphics than Crysis 3. Sure, the first game is amazing and the second fucking sucks, but you can't deny the fact that this:"

"Smaug from The Hobbit:"
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2T4T8xak3kfrom a tech standpoint? for sure. i think the use of the dragons is a bit better in ROF. the way they dribble fire, the smart use of fog/smoke to cover up the limitations the animation has. smaug is gorgeous, but he felt...cartoonish. I don't disagree.If we are talking from a purely technological standpoint, some of the dragons in How to Train Your Dragon are beautifully done. Special effects: awesome. Movie: not so awesome.The concept of the Dragon male to female dynamic made me picture the alpha crop dusting all the fertile females with his seed. I don't know whether this made me like it less or way more. I loved this movie. I've only seen this movie once. It was with my buddies in high school, the group of friends I drifted away from. I kinda like having this as a memory of them. Althought not a dragon, I want to give a shoutout to one of the best CGI monster I've ever seen in The Host (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mw6xfpZ7xpw). But I must say, having never seen Reign of Fire before, this is quite the feat for such a year. Awesome movies, the Skydiving scene was great!"
"Here's an interview with the animation house:"
"http://www.awn.com/animationworld/reign-fire-breathing-life-dragonsCGI, maybe... but nothing gets better for me than **Falkor the Luck Dragon**37 minutes and nobody has chimed in with, technically he's not a dragon... yet?  I'm shocked. [deleted]Oooo Last ShadowSo... are Saphira and Toothless the only *actual* CGI *dragons* ever on screen?I work with the Technical Director behind the dragons.  He's a huge perfectionist, so I'm not surprised.Smaug > AllI watch this while on the toilet, my mom asked if I was having an epic shit...Reign of Fire got kind of a bad rap. I thought it was a great flick for what it was. Kind of a kickass callback to the B-rate post apocalypse movies from the 80's. Plus McConaughey as a neo-barbarian Ahab was awesome! Also, what song is playing in this video? Is it from Inception or is it just another cut and paste tune from genius Hans Zimmer or one of his proteges? False."
"https://youtu.be/TmcCW8zqZEw"
"Can't even tell it's a cgi dragon. As opposed to, ya know, live action dragons.but but but...what about eragon."
"Seriously though. Smaug was pretty decent looking.*cough cough* Those are actually wyverns...The dragon from 7th Voyage of Sinbad is still my favorite. I'm a little tired of wyvern type dragons dominating cinema... I want to see a new design shake things up. Makes me curious to see del Toro's ideas for Smaug. I know I have a strong chance being downvoted in the midst of this circlejerk, but I've got to say, I just watched the video and those dragons look like total shit to me. Their movements and extremely clunky and unrealistic and the CGI, while advanced for the time, is total shit compared to today's standards. Honestly, even the Game Of Thrones dragons leave these guys buried under over 9000ft of dust, dirt and rubble. Drogon imo is the most detailed cgi dragon, even the little tubes in his mouth where the fire comes from are so detailed.this movie is ridiculous.  Apocalypse caused by dragons??  There's a reason the US stopped using flamethrowers and mechanically powered flight in the 50's. Its because they aren't effective in modern combat."
"Which means dragons with flamethrowers and mechanically powered flight would get annihilated by jet powered fighters and surface to air missiles."
"It might have been a little believable if they set it in the 19th century. I was 9 when I saw this on tv. I got about half way and then my mom turned off the t.v. and told me I had to go to bed. As a kid I never found out the name of the film (somehow) and forgot about it entirely because I didn't discover gaming yet and played outside.... GUESS WHAT MOM, I'M 21 NOW AND I'M WATCHING THIS K? AT WHATEVER TIME I WANT... REVIEWS ARENT GREAT.. BUT I WATCH WICKERMAN FOR GOOD LAUGHS. And Ring of Fire is still my favorite country song. So there's that. Wyvern - 2 legs"
"; Dragon - 4 legsHave we really seen many CGI dragons? I mean, these are all Wyverns.Animation cost has pretty much prevented using better models of dragons. 2 legs & wings it much cheaper & less time consuming that animating creature whit 4 legs & wings. Even smaug was originally 4 legged dragon, but production cost cut him to a wyvern. https://i.imgur.com/NaZKKiM.jpgThat is the only reasonable explanation for this I've ever herd. Most people just try to argue that they are cuz reasons. BUT THAT makes total seance.I think 'How to Train Your Dragon' is better.Fantastic movie! Although at risk of being downvoted into oblivion, it's a wyvren."
"Dragons have four legs, wyvrens have two.This movie is notoriously bad. Why are we in 2015 saying this is a decent film? I thought the Internet never forgets :/I've never heard that.  I just pretend that they harvest the dragons' glands to fuel the vehicles, and that helps the story fall together nicely.  But what about Eragon, it was such a good movie. /si think saphira was the ONLY redeeming quality to that film. Those are wyverns, not dragons.Not a dragon. Wyvern. Those aren't dragons, they're Wyverns."
"Dragons have 4 legs and wings."
"Wyverns have 2 legsToo bad they're actually wyvern..Ehem... wyvern."
"But that's a wyvernWyvern*I'd like to point out that these creatures aren't technically Dragons; they are Wyverns."
"Dragons have six limbs. Four legs and two wings whereas Wyverns have four limbs; two legs and two wings that double as their front arms/ legs.*Wyverns."
"Not Dragons. There are no Dragons in Reign of Fire.That's a modern distinction.Speak for yourself, for me it's a http://i.ytimg.com/vi/oCGG39APAWU/maxresdefault.jpgWell, you've just inspired me to rewatch this.its very comparable to the hobbit dragon scene id say.First movie I bought when I got a blu-ray player. Wouldn't have done it any other way. I was so sad when this movie got shit on at reviews. Just the dragons were satisfying to watch. I'd love to see more stories from that universe.You mean that film Helicopters vs Dragons?Was Smaug really that bad?  I thought he looked pretty good...I thought Smaug was really well done.RIP Game of Thrones fans XDI disagreeReally ? I loved this movie, but I think Smaug is the best I have seen on screen.[deleted]Smaug is very stylized though. He was designed sort of cartoonist. These look more realistic.Smaug was better.Great movie.Funny, I almost watched this last night but opted for The Blob (80s version). Now I want to watch it but Walking Dead comes first.I remember once reading how many duraflame love they used.  I can't recall the number but it was ridiculous. Smaug was better, as was Sapphira from Eargon pity about the rest of that movie though.Can't say I agree with that. They're very well done, but I don't think they're the best dragons I've ever seen. I'd argue Smaug was pretty awesome looking, and whatever might be said about Eragon Saphira was pretty impressive."
"And if we're counting TV, then Drogon/Viserion/Rhaegal are also better done, in my opinion.I don't know, I thought the Hobbit was pretty dang good with Smaug... one of the bright spots of those films IMO.It seemed fake to me.  Dragons that flew with ease even with their wings all torn up.   The wings flapped as fast as a small bird, unrealistic for wings so large.   Thanks guys. I now know the true meaning of RIP my inbox.OK, but, could the reason for that be that nobody's made another dragon movie since then?  And the reason for that, is that *Reign of Fire* was an awful, unwatchable bomb?"
"12 worthwhile films from last year that you (actually) may have missed[deleted]Rob the Mob was meh. You da real mvp!I only wish more were on Netflix or Prime Instant."
"niceFYI, Rob the Mob is coming up unavailable on netflix. Odd Thomas was okay though.Netflix *DVD*How did you do this? All manually?This is pretty amazing, thanks man!MarkDude great job! Pretty cool to see how many of these movies are on Amazon Instant!Thanks! I'll watch a few on netflix!dang, couldn't find Electric Slide either."
"[deleted]I love you.[deleted]You da manThanks! This is awesome!Loved Odd Thomas, definitely going to check out the others. [deleted]The movie gives a skeletal outline of the book, but misses the tone and relationships completely. The relationship with the girlfriend, which I agree is one of the weaker parts of the movie, is an important and well developed part of the book and is the major force behind the sense of loss at the end. The book has a tension building sense of disaster that pulls you in and doesn't let you go. The movie just couldn't get over trying to be an action flick.[deleted]The book is absolutely worth reading. When I was just out of high school, I loaned it to quite a few of my friends with all of them loving it. I haven't met anyone who thought it was terrible.The book gives a very good sense of how much she gives his life hope and meaning in a world where his talent constantly forces him into terrible situations. It's a huge loss for him at the end and the reader feels it acutely.I agree, the movie just gets the tone of the book wrong entirely. This film felt like its some weird horror TV series marketed towards early teens. Everything just felt wrong, which is too bad. I've only read three out of the seven books, and the book Brother Odd, would make a fantastic horror-mystery film with the right people infront and behind the camera.So dissapointed in how hokey the movie version was.  I love all the Odd Thomas books and they get even darker than the first one. This movie messed up the potential for a great series.This list is actually made mostly of unknown films. Congratulations.Using top comment for visibility. Check out this movie. Really good! http://m.imdb.com/title/tt2866360/I have to disagree. I look on videoeta every couple of weeks so I dont miss anything. If I missed any of these it was because they sucked.It is impressive. I haven't seen one movie on that list. Saved.Love this listAnd a lot of them were also really, really good. The Signal, Time Lapse, Let's Kill Ward's Wife, Rob the Mob and even Stonehearst Asylum were all fantastic movies.Of those I've seen The Signal. I found that movie so far from fantastic I'm sort of curious what you found fantastic about it. The beginning third or so, like up until that *one part* had me in the zone, interested to see where it was headed. Then it becomes so uninteresting and full of go-nowhere, unimportant, cliche occurrences, that I thought I was going to leave the theatre (just) fairly disappointed with it as a whole. By the end, it was probably the first time I've ever wanted my money back after seeing a movie in theatres. It becomes such an empty shell of a movie I really am curious what you thought was fantastic."
"[spoilers](#s The ending is so shameless taken from a part of Dark City with absolutely nothing added that I was pretty upset I had paid to see it.)Completely agree. I replied to an above comment, but my takeway is that this is a film with absolutely nothing to say. It's a showcase for the director.  Also, I forgot the female character in the movie was totally pointless. Jarringly so. The only thing she really does in the entire movie is give them a reason for being on the road in the first place. Her character contributes nothing, does nothing, has no value. If anything, all she does is slow them down. The romantic subplot, the character, really, could have been cut from the film entirely and the movie would have been exactly the same. Them looking for Nomad was enough of a reason for them to have been on the road. Them helping his girlfriend move into college was pointless."
"And another thing about the end of the movie that bothers me"
"[spoilers](#s When I saw them loading her onto the helicopter and knew there couldn't be more than 10 minutes left in the movie...The sequel bait killed me. I was borderline insulted I had sat through that movie and here was the filmmaker trying to set up a sequel.)The scene where the girl gets sucked up into the sky like a ragdoll was where it went from bad to worse imo.God, it was so boring. The scenes with the protagonist running in slow-motion were just unbearable. I just saw it after reading your comment and oh my god i agree. It has some nice scenes and in the first half of the movie i had my hopes up for some good plot, but then it just fucks up so hard."
"I waited for a ah now it makes sense moment, but they could also show a cat licking it's ass at the end which would make the same sense as the endI also appreciated that. But I wonder how many deserve their reputation; only two from the list were rated 7 or higher by IMDB users."
"Edit: an update for all those who have problems with IMDB ratings; here are the RT % fresh values for these movies, in the order of listing:"
"67, 63, 33, N/A, 93, 20, 35, 83, 80, 52, 56, N/A"
"Again: a list heavily populated by films that were not especially well-received.[deleted]I saw Sparks, it was prety neat"
"Also Odd Thomas is a good filmI forgot this was on the list, its a top 10 movie for the year imo and the cgi wasnt bad at all.I've got some of the Odd Thomas books, didn't know they'd made a film so TIL.It's on the USA Netflix As a fan of the books, I was a bit let down by the film. Anton Yelchin is one of my favorite actors, and I think he was a perfect pick to play Odd, but some of the writing and directing made it seem a bit too silly, everyone just talks too quickly and perfectly. I think it would have been way better if they slowed the scenes down a bit and added another 30-60 minutes to the film. One of my biggest gripes with the film, though, is that they completely ignore the fact that Stormy was molested by her foster father when she was a child. They keep Stormy and Odd's relationship as innocent as it was in the book, but people unaware of her past won't understand why Stormy and Odd aren't as physically intimate as most couples, and it comes off making Odd just look completely oblivious and uninterested in her rather than mature and respectful. They also fail to mention Odd's issues with guns and don't show the scene where he goes to talk to his mother. All around, I was hoping for a much darker film, but in the end I was just happy to see Anton Yelchin play Odd Thomas.Coming from someone who was not familiar with the story, this was really useful insight.  Thank you very much!Honest question - Do people really find IMDB ratings useful? I've read a few postings on their boards about movies I have watched and the discussions are either moronic or completely toxic. I've never gotten familiar with their ratings system, so I ignore it in favor of RT and Metacritic. It's 1 to 10... not that much to get familiar with. With their decimal system it's more like 1 to 100, but that's not what I meant."
"Usually for these things I try and figure out what an average movie looks like, how often movies receive certain scores, and how high- or low-skewed the ratings tend to be, as well as whether I usually agree with their scores or not."
"It seems like every time I look, the IMDb score is different from what I expect, likely as a result of user input rather than critic opinions. Because of that, I haven't bothered spending much time with it and never really use it to gauge whether I'll like a movie. It's the same reason I almost never take into account the user reviews on MC or RT.Gotcha. I've found that 7 is a decent rating for movies. I've used that as a bit of a guideline over the years when thinking about seeing a new movie in the theater."
"TV shows are inflated, in my experience. It's somewhat uncommon to see a movie rated 8.0 or above, but it doesn't seem to be uncommon at all for TV shows."
"As a general barometer and taken with a pinch of salt, the ratings have been pretty close to my own tastes. For reference, [here are the top rated TV shows with at least 5,000 submitted ratings](http://www.imdb.com/search/title?num_votes=5000,&sort=user_rating,desc&title_type=tv_series).Thanks! I agree and disagree with an equal number of the top hundred-or-so. I'll have to keep using the site and see what happens.To me the worst thing in the IMDB boards is the completely misguided elitism - if you openly dislike the movie on its board, you necessarily are a Transformers fan. But otherwise I think there are some great IMDB posts on boards, including theories for ambiguous movies.  It's shitty elitism, since they're pretty middlebrow elitists.  They've never seen anything older than 1970 and are obsessed with the hyper-male standards (e.g. Scorcese).There's a huge distinction between the *ratings* and the reviews/boards. I think the former are useful while the latter can be near random (or worse!).  IMDb ratings just show you how popular a movie is in the 18-34 white/male/middle class/nerd demographic."
"I think Fellowship of the Ring used to be rated as the greatest film *of all time* and each LOTR that came out after supplanted it as the new #1.  Right now the #1 is Shawshank Redemption, which is just sentimental, schmaltzy middle American high brow IMO."
"Then I think The Dark Knight took the spot for a while."
"Raid 2 or something else everyone is  fawning over might take the top spot next.The first line is just flat-out inaccurate. Take a look at the list:http://www.imdb.com/chart/top"
"Go to any movie's page, then click the hypertext enumerating the votes (below/next to the rating). You can see the demographics for yourself. Notably, the Shawshank Redemption has a 9.3 average for males and a 9.2 for females."
"The average from males over 45 is a slightly lower 8.9 (9.0 for females, which is broadly consistent with almost every movie I've looked at the demographics for having a higher average from young people as from older people (regardless of movie))."
"Admittedly if you look at the statistics for The Dark Knight, the average score for those over 45 is markedly lower (8.2) than for 18-29 year olds (9.2), however the average is similar for males as for females. But if you look throughout the top 250, most movies have pretty similar scores across all demographics with the exception of a few foreign films (especially those from India and Turkey) which have very low averages from US users but which have high averages from their countries of origin."
"Edit: GrammarI want you to think really hard on these questions:"
"* Do I understand what /u/thepubmix's claim even meant?"
"* Did my evidence directly support my claim/refute his claim?"
"* Was my evidence drawn from a large enough sample size?"
"* Do I even understand the *kind* of evidence that would be relevant for that purpose?"
"I think you'll find you need to go back to the drawing board. I'll help you if you can't figure it out on your own.[deleted]Where did I say I dislike Shawshank Redemption? If I did I'd like you to point it out for me so I can totally eat my words. I like the movie. I've seen it at least 5 times, mostly because it's the ovaltine of TV programming. I just don't think it's anything special."
"I even said it's a decent movie in my previous comment. You don't read carefully, do you?"
"That said, you kinda-sorta corroborated my claim about how universally palatable and perfectly middle-of-the-road it is."
"And I may be an asshole but I'm right. His refutation belied his misunderstanding of my claim and his supporting evidence was laughable at best.It takes a while for new movies to settle in. They shoot to the top, then eventually they sink back down to a normal spot. Shawshank has been the top movie for as long as I can remember, although it does get replaced sometimes, it moves back to its normal spot. The rest of the top ten includes 2 Godfather films, 12 Angry Men, TDK, Schindler's List, The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly, LOTR, and Fight Club. I'd say that's a decent spread."
"Also, who killed all the joy in your heart? Shawshank Redemption is a fantastic film. Shawshank is a decent movie but nothing special.  It's like the Driving Miss Daisy of prison movies."
"And most of the list is ok but I'd say having TDK, Fight Club, LOTR in the list kinda proves my point.  TDK, the whole LOTR series (ROTK was seriously flawed though), and Fight Club are all excellent films... but top 10 of all time?  Nowhere close."
"As an aside:"
"12 Angry Men is still a classic in my mind but it really hasn't aged all that well.  Since I became a trial attorney it's gotten hard to take many facets of the jury deliberation seriously (Fonda buys a knife at a store one night and brings it into deliberation as a piece of freaking evidence to sway the jurors... there's a mistrial right there), a lot of the psychology is pretty drugstore-y and the juror personalities are kind of simplistic.  That said, it is still a fantastic meditation on the nature of beyond a reasonable doubt and virtues/dangers of our criminal jury trial system."
"Yeah I see your point. I can actually help prove your point: I'm a 30 year old white male, and my girlfriend and I take turns showing each other movies the other hasn't seen. Over the course of the last 15 months, maybe 3 movies she's shown me have been on the top 250 on IMDB, while the vast majority of the ones I've shown her have been. So I suppose that list is helpful, if you're a 18-34 white/male/middle class/nerd, and I just didn't want to admit to being that predictable.The ratings aren't useful much at all either.Polarizing movies rarely have too good of a score on IMDB; not being popular certainly doesn't help. I'm actually not a big fan of it but 'Under The Skin' holds a mere 6.3 despite being on a lot of critic's top 10 movies of the year.  There are a LOT of great films with 6 scores on IMDB, and a lot of decent films with 5's.  It really doesn't mean much.That's a great point. But the downside of Under the Skin (which I loved) is that it's too spare on plot and narrative to win over the average viewer; OP descrbes a lot of these movies as having other, more fundamental problems in his write-ups, so I guess I was left cold for almost all of these. Its just one guys opinionBut the two in the list I have seen (Odd Thomas and Sparks) make me think the others probably aren't worthwhile.It's just a hipster list, the blurb at the start pretty much admits itOdd Thomas is a much better book.Odd Thomas was the only movie on this list I've seen and it was pretty rubbish honestly. He sells these movies well enough though that I am going to check out a few of them.Can you give each of them a brief review, please? Why did you think they weren't worthwhile and what were their redeeming qualities?Odd Thomas is directed by Stephen Sommers who is good at fun action with fun characters. The movie starts well enough, although Thomas does seem to do much more action movie stuff than his character would be doing - I'm guessing there's a lot less busting down doors and parkour in the books - but it's a fun frenetic style and Sommers knows how to direct fun action."
"There are two major problems with the movie - the bad things' plan doesn't really make any sense given their immense potential power. But instead of using brute force and/or numbers (which we know they've done in the past, successfully) they try and be tricksy. It's just... odd."
"The second problem is the plot revolves around trying to prevent mass murder. That seems like a good thing, right? And it is. The problem is that if you cut out the oogedy boogedy guys it's a fairly realistic scenario in America. But the overall tone is somewhat cartoony frantic fun with a supernatural spookyness, not horrible real world murder stuff. So there's a serious tone problem."
"I believe the movie's release was delayed/cancelled for years because of the too-similar-to-real-shootings plot. That's a whole other argument. As a movie the problem is that tonal gear changing - thinking about that Aurora shooting guy while trying  to enjoy CGI heavy action chase scenes."
"There's a few other niggly points but those are things that jumped out at me while watching the movie that are likely the reason I didn't dig it."
"Redeeming qualities - the lead performances are good. Everything is somewhat hypercharged and hammy but that was clearly what Sommers wanted from them and they did it about as good as you can. The action is fun when it's not CGI heavy. That's about it."
"Sparks is one of those independent movies that tries to do too much. The writer/director had a lot of style ideas, element ideas and is not very good at dialogue or story. It feels like fan fiction meets cosplay."
"Again, the performers did OK. It's hard to be sure with that dialogue though."
"It's only interesting feature is that it was shot quickly on a very low budget and isn't Plan 9 level bad. It's just really cheesy. That's about it.You will not regret a moment of Odd Thomas. You may thing that could have been better if x, y, z... and then you'll think I hope they made a sequel and it's better."
"For the signal you will either be disappointed by the ending or have no strong opinion on the ending at all.Before I Disappear is a full length film based on the director's short film called Curfew, which won an Oscar for best live action short a couple years ago. That short was amazing, imo, and the film was something that I thought was superb."
"I'd ranked it 9/10 when I saw it at a film festival back in April.Odd Thomas is alright.  Really liked The SignalThe Signal is fantastic, check it out THE SIGNAL gave me much to think about. After watching it I immediately regretted not enjoying it with a group in a theatre so as to have an in-depth discussion following. Yeah its not a bad movie.Reminded me a bit of [From Dust Til Dawn](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116367/) because it starts in one genre and completely turns into something else. I didn't like it all that much. I remember seeing advertising for it around my theatre leading up to it's release, then it was only there one weekend (the advertising was months in advance). The film itself was ok, and given a proper run it could have made more and gotten more attention, but there was little outside of cryptic posters and such about it in terms of advertising.The end of the signal was predictable and disappointing.>The Signal is fantastic"
"Watched it last night. I thought it was rather pointless. Similar to the shit goes wrong, the movie style only closer to a shit gets mysterious, the movie. No real story to get into. But probably pretty good for people who like aimless twilight zone level mysteries.It's not so much a film as it is a demo reel for the director. Very pretty, but incredibly frustrating to watch. I wasn't a fan. Saying that your movie is high concept sci-fi does not excuse the lack of a coherent plot, no matter how good your cinematography and composition is. Rob the Mob isn't bad either. Great list from the Mob3 I've seen.Force Majeure is one of the best movies I saw all year. Very well done and very goodThe director of *The Signal* is quite the visual artist. His previous film, *Love* was beautifully shot as well. I second *Odd Thomas* as well, that one surprised me. Its a shame it never got any coverage because I would've loved to have seen a franchise borne out of that series.Why does the signal keep getting praise for visuals? It was a a rated movie and was mostly desert shots the whole movie. It was a good movie but still.I thought Odd Thomas was good. The Signal had great visuals, and slowly changed genre's throughout the film, but I was disappointed in the ending.Odd Thomas started as a SPECTACULAR Bish supernatural movie with a good main character and good 'system'... and then it sloooowly pulled on an iron glove and punched me right in the feels, which ended up pushing it over the line from  good to great for me. Definitely check out the books, then. There's a lot that the movie leaves out, especially with Stormy's past and the nature of her and Odd's relationship.Ugh. The books started good until Odd devolved from quirky to flat out annoying. When do you think he got annoying? I've read all but the last book and loved just about every moment.Don't remember the name but the plot involved a small town near a bay and some smugglers on a boat I believe. I found myself getting very annoyed by his witty banter. Odd hours. I didn't mind it too much but it starts getting a bit weird.I was really underwhelmed by The Signal, but on a visual and general production value level it was very impressive.The signal felt like a really visually interesting MTV attempt at teen sci fi...That being said, I did not understand that movie at all. The ending just left me clueless. Is there any conclusion we had to pull from it, or is it left to our own imagination?are you dumb? the ending was very clear and obviousHis gf wanted them to goto vegas, but always refused out of fear of his powers and the larger number of incidents he would have to face.  I took it as in the end he took his powers as a responsibility to help people an headed out to start a new life.  This is for Odd Thomas, haven't seen the signal yet.Which is kind of silly because Odd never goes to Vegas and is still living in Pico Mundo in the second book.I've never read the books.  Actually didn't know they were books until I came into this thread.  How are they?Really good. If you were entertained even slightly by the movie, then you'll love the books. There's so much more back story for the characters that adds a lot more weight to them. As a big fan of the series I was actually a bit let down by the movie. I won't spoil anything, but definitely read the first book at least.I've almost all of the books up until Koontz's Anti-atheism subplots overtook his main plots. Well maybe I am suffering from too many Koontz novel fatigue.I never really got an anti-atheism message from any of his books. Is this something recent? Anything specific from the Odd Thomas series? I've read all of them except for the last one and never really picked up on anything anti-atheist. Odd strikes me as someone who would probably be an atheist if it weren't for his abilities, there's never any mention of a specific religion except for Stormy's cross, but even she had views which conflicted with any church's views on the afterlife. Odd even says multiple times that he has no idea what exists in the afterlife, and he seems like someone who is extremely comfortable in not knowing, unlike people who follow religion and use it as a way to understand the unknowable.It's not the Odd Series specifically, I'm alluding to. Although, in the first or second book if I'm not mistaken the evil bad guys were identified as being Atheist and the same true for his father. While Odd would be considered very Jesuit grounded in reality in the face overwhelming religiosity. Brother Odd really drilled it home in this series. However, I give this series a pass even though it usually targets fanatical super science as the enemy. But once you consider his Frankenstein series, all those one-off books that basically boiled down to if you're faithful enough you'll defeat the corrupted evil godless heathens. Personally, as a atheist I had no problem with them they were interesting story but after a while they became too predictable same as Koontz's obsession with dogs.Actually, the antagonists in the first two books were definitely not atheists. In the first book they were devil worshippers, or satanists, they all had the matching tattoos. In the second book, I think they were some sort of cultists. But now that you mentioned it, Brother Odd is really the only one I can see being construed as anti-atheist, maybe I wasn't paying close enough attention, but it didn't feel very blatant to me if it was. Admittedly, Brother Odd is probably one of my least favorite of the series, and has the weakest protagonist. But at least the series got a lot better after that and didn't continue to decline, I'm excited to finally read the last book.The book makes much more sense. Its a fantastic series of books."
"The movie was decent, but like they say the book was better than the movie.Spoilers ahead for Odd Thomas:"
"Odd Thomas stars a young man who was born with a gypsy curse he inherited from his Gypsy mother, to see and communicate with ghosts. The dead can not speak but they give hints and visions to Thomas so that he may solve their deaths or prevent catastrophes."
"However, there are monsters that lurk between the spirit world and human world and they feed off of negativity and violence. If they ever swarm around someone, that person is bound to die usually under normal situations such as the breaks of the sports car not working. These creatures hate Ghost Whispers and will kill them."
"Thomas notices something weird about how the creatures continue to circle around 1gross man. With the dream mentioned to Thomas by a friend involving mass death, Thomas concludes that because that man hasnt been killed by the creatures that the man will be the cause of all of the deaths."
"Fastforward to the Mall scene and as it turns out, the creatures knew Thomas can see them and was distracting Thomas from the true mastermind of the murder spree.  Even though the gross man was a collaborator with the other 3 men, the creatures turned their attention to him so Thomas couldnt stop the other 3 (bald guy and 2 cops)."
"Then fastforward to Thomas spending time with Stormie and William Dafoe showing up and telling him its time to let her go.  The dead cant speak and she died at the mall shooting.  The feels..."
"Las Vegas, the city of sin.  Stormie felt that Las Vegas was too dangerous for Thomas to use his gift.  With Stormie gone, Thomas has nothing to do but save and help as many people as he can. I saw it as a suicide mission. He still gets to do good and may die a lot sooner and could be with Stormie. Man that ending was like boulder in stomach heavy.It was pretty clear cut I think. [The Signal spoilers](#s Laurence Fishburne is an alien and the three protagonists were test subject experiments.)The director of *The Signal* also has the habit of going batshit insane in the ending minutes of his movies. Not that I am complaining ;)"
"Also he is a redditor : /u/superswift What the fuck was LOVE's ending? Seriously, I've seen it about 10 times now, is he God?Starring Ron Pearlman (from basically everything)"
"Ronny P is the Holy Ghost, everywhere and nowhere all at once.This thread is making me tear my hair out. Every single movie from the list has comments saying this was gud followed immediately by this was not gud. I don't know who to believe.I'll simplify it for you. See Force Majeure. Everything else on the list, don't bother.And Rob the Mob. Rob the Mob is worth a watch.but i heard it was not gud :(This gets upvotes?  I guess they're from people who've seen all the films?It's simple, they're almost all polarising movies. Watch one from a genre you like if you have some time to kill."
"Or just pick a movie from an insanely big list of [critically acclaimed](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt/?year=2014) or [popular movies](http://www.imdb.com/search/title?year=2014,2014&title_type=feature&num_votes=1000,&sort=user_rating,desc), if you want to be a little bit more guaranteed of quality. I mean, who genuinely watches the 200+ well-received movies every year?Fun fact: I worked on the set of +1 as a featured double. I was the body double for the passed out dude on the couch. Haha that's awesome! I think your role was probably my favorite. What was it like on set?It was really chill. We'd arrive to set around 6pm every day, get our clothes, hair, and make up done, and just chill around with each other. Usually extras only see each other a few times on a single set, but we saw each other for almost a full month, so we all became our own little family. We'd bring board games, small stereo systems, etc to chill between takes. Some kids got too crazy and would go off into the woods and do drugs and drink (to which they immediately got kicked off set) but the majority of us were just happy to be making about $100 a day. Days were long though. We'd be there sunset to sunrise. I think the longest day on set for all of us was from 6pm to 10am. I got to prescreen this at purdue! The director came by, spoke about it, then asks for our opinions/suggestions (though it was rather late in post for any major changes). I watched it again after it came out and watch surprised by some soundtrack changes.Any idea of where I could watch it?It's on Netflix and Amazon Prime I believe.I can't find it on either the American nor Canadian netflixit was on american netflix awhile back.  i personally didn't care for ithttp://www.netflix.com/search/plus%20oneYeah you're right, I checked and was able to find it under one of the actors names. It doesn't work when searching +1 which was my problem.Another +1 fun fact: The film was originally titled Plus One and they changed it for the sole reason that having it start with a + would list it first alphabetically on VOD sites. Yeah I remember all my call sheets and the scripts I saw on set saying Plus One. That's pretty smart of them to change it to make it stand out!I was pleasantly surprised by Odd Thomas. I watched it on Netflix and expected a straight to dvd jump scare filled trainwreck attempting to be uber scary; what I got was a surprisingly sweet character study with supernatural elements. It felt almost like a Speilberg film with the touches of humor and relationship elements.I never quite got this, if you expected the movie to be *awful* why did you watch it?It was pretty good overall, but the girl who played Odd Thomas' girlfriend was an atrocious actress--Jesus Christ she was horrible.In her defense, her dialogue in the book was nearly identical to how cringey it was in the movie."
"So  wouldn't blame it *all* on her deliveryWhat? That was a *terrible* movie. The dialogue was god-awful and the whole think reeked of being a quick book adaptation. Seriously a total waste of my time.I enjoyed it overall, neat story, but its weakest point was the corny dialogue. People just do not talk like that, it was unnatural and distracting.The story was interesting, but many things in the movie were poorly executed. And indeed, the dialogue was tepid. One of my friends highly recommended Odd Thomas, but I found it to be an alright film. Started out really well, but as the film progressed it just got worse and worse.I felt that they were trying to go with a Buffy the Vampire Slayer type dialogue, but felt short. I wouldn't say terrible, but yeah I don't think it was that good. I thought the acting apart from Yelchin's was questionable, and some of the design choices were just really absurd. Like the first serial killer guy they meet, the one who's a fatty. The movie's depiction of him was almost like a comedic clown, all of his actions were way overdone. In the book he was supposed to be fat and weird-looking, yeah, but also creepy and menacing. I mean I learned a valuable lesson from the ending."
"[Odd Thomas Ending Spoilers](#s If your boyfriend is clairvoyant and tells you to stay home today, you probably should listen to him)Also turns out to be the only movie in this list that is available on Netflix Stonehearst Asylum is on there.Is it very similar to John Dies at the End? That's the vibe I got from it, but I couldn't get into that film after reading the book.As far as the books go John Dies at the End is a comedy with supernatural elements, whereas Odd Thomas is a dark, supernatural story with a couple of comedic moments. Unfortunately, the film adaptation of Odd Thomas just ends up being a bit too silly, and Anton Yelchin's performance is really the only one that's accurate to the book.Same here.  Has a lot more substance and plot than what I was expecting.  I have developed a crush on [Addison Timlin](http://www.hawtcelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ADDISON-TIMLIN-at-Stand-Up-Guys-Premiere-in-New-York-2.jpg) now and also liked her role in Stand Up Guys.  Something about how she holds her mouth when she talks or something I find adorableI suggest that anyone that was even slightly entertained by the movie should read the book, if not the whole series. It's one of my favorite book series and stands out from most of Koontz's other novels.Have you seen her guest stint on *Californication*? You should you know. For the... plot.Just a note about Sparks: I saw it back in March of 2013 when it premiered at a local film fest. The description made it out to be really interesting, but when you see admittedly very flawed in this, you better believe it. The writer of the comic book it was based on also adapted it and co-directed it. The CGI and special effects in general are at the point where it doesn't look good but it doesn't look bad enough to make the movie funny."
"The comic book clearly had fans too. People dressed up at the premiere and were super excited to get pictures with the actors and the creators. But in between the time I saw it and the time when the next movie was showing, I went to get food. On the way back we passed Ashley Bell, one of the leads. She and the rest of the people in the crew were pissed. You could clearly tell that she was as disappointed with the movie as everyone else was."
"Someone will say, you only think its bad because it wasn't a big budget superhero movie. That's not even it. Its the writing. Props to the writer of the comic book for getting enough interest in it to want to make a movie, but get someone else to write it. There comes a time when you have to figure out what is important to the story and what is not."
"EDIT: I've decided it would be best to replace it: check out another (better) movie that came out at Cinequest (where Sparks premiered). Its called Love in the Time of Monsters. Its full of campy B-movie fun. I should be getting a straight-to-DVD release someday soon.I thought it was unwatchable. Literally didn't get past the first 15 mins.Same. Eveything about it was terrible.I've seen a lot of mixed reviews for +1, but I really enjoyed it. It has a pretty unique concept, and turned out a lot differently than I expectedIs it very similar to [Coherence](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2866360/)?"
"I kind of forgot about that movie, it actually is somewhat similar plot wise. Tonally, the films are completely different. I probably enjoyed +1 more, and it stands out as much more memorable to me.Maybe it happened to the filmmakers who went off to make slightly different, but essentially similar movies describing their experience.I had the exact same question."
"When I read the description I couldn't believe this wasn't some kind of mistake, and he meant Coherence."
"I really enjoyed Coherence, so I'll probably check out +1 and Time Lapse.Watched Rob the Mob on a whim and enjoyed it quite a bit. Nothing spectacular but it was an enjoyable watch.I saw The Signal a few days before it was released at a screening. While the visuals were definitely some of best and most interesting of 2014, I really thought the storyline was awful. It tried to withhold information from the audience so as to keep us interested and more curious. While some films can do this well, The Signal withheld too much for too long and lost my interest after a while. And the ending was just terrible. This is just my opinion though, it's still a very cool movie that some will enjoy checking out. What do you guys think?Man 100% agree ! I saw this list and started with watching the signal, i'm just posting to vent my anger about the movie. So much confusion in a bad way and nothing was really explainedGonna check out Stonehearst Asylum, it looks like something I'd like. Thanks!Damn good movie.Probably one of the most forgettable films I've ever watched.[deleted]Yea I had forgotten all about it until I saw this list.  I had forgotten all about it again until you replied to me.[deleted]Do you understand that saying that is also a spoiler?I would have looked it up without all the warnings.It was a pretty big let down. I really enjoyed that movie. Kate Beckinsale and Jim Sturgess were great in it. Great story too if you don't take it too seriously.It's Poe, and I think the movie did a fine job of making it seem like the story.I recently watched it on Netflix.  It's definitely not as good as I was hoping.  A very flawed film, but good enough for a Saturday night in with popcorn.I enjoyed it. Wouldn't pay money to watch it in theaters, but it's definitely not a bad film.Force Majeure is one of my favorite movies of the year, the themes were similar to some issues I'm having right now and it really helped me through tough times.Oh, you're a coward, too?Unfortunately, yes. I'm scared of a lot of things and I get very nervous in front of others. I'm trying to work on it but I don't know if I can change it. Don't know why people are down voting you, you're correct.nice post - i plan to check out the signal[deleted]Revealing that there is a plot twist is still a spoiler. I see.If you love sci-fi movies you will enjoy it.  I thought it was really cool and quite unique.It was good.  I called it about halfway through, but still enjoyed it thoroughly which says something about the strength of the movie and its ability to keep you hooked.  Definitely worth checking out.I loved it. One of my favorites from last year. Its pretty good. Prepare to be uber confused. > the signal"
"Check out the trailer, it's one of the best trailers I've seen. I immediately rented it after seeing it."
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXV_CU_ryKsyou rent films? why bother?HD on amazon?Wait a minute, you rent movies?Holy hell I'm getting tired of this kind of response.  Amazon provides renting options that are still very popular.My SO and I are pretty die-hard sci-fi fans and we both thought it was awful, but judging from the comments I suppose you're just going to have to see for yourself!These Final Hours is also great."
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jozEpGIrzeUThanks for the recommendation, that was a great film.thanks for this recommendation. *excellent* movie. would not have seen it had you not postedDude, actual such a dope movie. Shame it didn't get much recognition.Did that ever come out?And The Mule! Also from Australia.Loved this one!I would also add [Coherence](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2866360/) to that list. I love time travel type stuff an really enjoyed both +1 and Time Lapse. Thought Time Lapse was a bit better but both were worth watching IMO. Can't say the same about The Signal.[deleted]Not sure if typo, or the movie has excellent nudity. Currently watching. Excellent breasts, but they aren't exposed, at least not yet.I second Force Majeure so bad. One of the best films of last year with deep and complex themes about things in life which we try not to think about.Anyone have a list of where these are available?I put [a list together in this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2v6u4z/12_worthwhile_films_from_last_year_that_you/cof6mk2). I was unable to find Time Lapse and Electric Slide though, so you might have to resort to *alternative* methodsJust watched electric slide via alternative method. Not bad and alternated to my hard drive at 500kbs.i'll check em outSome of these movies may be 'flawed' like you mentioned, but Force Majeur is fantastic and was absolutely snubbed to not even get a foreign oscar nomination. I thought it was easily in the overall top 5 movies of 2014.I was really disappointed by The Signal. Well shot, as you said, but the ending (SPOILER ALERT, STOP READING HERE IF YOU'RE PLANNING TO SEE THE MOVIE) was completely ripped off of Dark City, right down to the camera angle.Not to mention the build up to the reveal was so much clumsier and the characters and flavor of the world were so much blander. God I hated The Signal.Time Lapse was brilliant but that's my opinion. It toys with the idea of fate and then throws in some gangsters !I thought the signal was pretty dumb especially the ending that I feel nothing is gonna happen with but to each his own I guess. i fucking hated Time Lapse, what a waste of time that shit was, i would recommend Coherence or The One I Love instead, but Force Majeure being on your list is awesome, that movie was awesome.force majeure was so good.  It made you uncomfortable to watch it was so real. Coherence was pretty boss, I just wonder why it wasn't called *De*coherence, as that's really what happens over the course of the  movie (plus it's just easier to say)."
"At the Q&A afterward, someone actually asked the director and lead actor if they wanted to remake the movie someday with a bigger budget and professional actors. That shit was awkward.  Time Lapse, a movie about people in a hotel room who find a camera that takes pictures and shows the future.  I'm not faulting them but that is a word for word description of an episode of The Twilight Zone.I liked Time Lapse although admittedly I watched it at 5am after not being able to sleep all night. Coherence was fabulous. I went in a little blind expecting some low budget who-dunnit but it was so much more and so much better! I thought it was pretty good,  great actors  atleast. I was going to say that the +1 plot sounded like Coherence, which I really liked. Now I'll have to track down +1 to compare. The description for +1 looked so similar to Coherence's. I wonder if it's as good.+1 is a great example of a great idea and mediocre execution.It's not.There is good reasons some of these movies flew under the radar, you even described one as being very flawed."
"I will say though, Rob the Mob sounds cliche, but is a *very* good film with an engaging story.  I enjoyed it very much and recommend it.Time lapse has the exact same plot of an old episode of the twilight zone where a poloroid camera shows the future.no love for What We Do in the Shadows?Yes, from me atleast."
"Not sure what it means but last year we had three excellent horror films coming out of Oz/NZ: *Housebound*, *The Babadook* and *What We Do In The Shadows*. Definitely not a horror film lolWhat We Do In The Shadows isn't a horror film.It's a mockumentary / comedy / horror."
"It's the Spinal Tap of vampire films, and I'd definitely say it has part of one leg in the horror genre."
"My point was more that one of the best vampire flicks of recent years has come from NZ.I cannot express how much I love that movie. It has me repeating lines all day like I used to do as a kid. Such a fresh, original movie.I wouldn't say that What We Do in the Shadows was a film that flew under radar. It's currently in top 10 on RT.[deleted]> +1"
"It was awful, I just watched it. Nobody acted the way I thought they would considering what's going on.Really? That sucks. I thought the premise was interesting but seeing the 5.5 imdb rating made me a bit cautious.I agree the premise seemed neat but it just should've went about things differently.The fencing part at the beginning wasn't poorly done, but it was still not so great.It's also not from 2014.Why? It sounds interesting.I can't find the DvDs for some of these on amazon :(I found most of these on Amazon Instant Video, except for Time Lapse and Electric Slide. I [posted all the ones I could on amazon](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2v6u4z/12_worthwhile_films_from_last_year_that_you/cof6mk2) and for some of them, in the description, there are links to Other Formats which include DVD and Blu-ray. Hope that helpsThank you!  But your link doesn't go anywhere?"
"Whoops, forgot the comment id at the end. I updated it. Thanks for letting me knowThanks.  Still stinks that not all of them have dvd/bluray.Yeah, I get owning the media physically, but dropping $10-$15 per movie is kinda steep, especially since a few of these movies seem like they're hit or miss with people. It would suck to buy the movie and it turns out you dislike/hate it.to each his own...  I just prefer physical I guess.Rob The Mob was whatever."
"The actors in Against The Sun were great, but the writing and editing didn't do it for me. Maybe it was over acted."
"The Signal was not worth it."
"This list is old, and son of a gun isn't on it, which is my recommendation for everyone.I endlessly recommend Starry Eyes, too, haven't heard too much buzz apart from it's initial reception. One of my favourite horrors of 2014.The Signal was so shitty it made my body hurt.Wasn't Time Lapse based on a Twilight Zone episode?The only one on this list that interests me is Time Lapse. Is it any good? It seems like OP is making lots of concessions for these films because they are low budget, which I don't agree with.I worked on Timelapse, so thank you very much for adding it to the list.really didn't enjoy the source or +1Alright, without spoilers, could somebody tell me why they liked or disliked +1? I really wanna watch it but I don't want to waste my time if it's not any goodI liked the concept, but I was annoyed at the end of the film. I didn't feel like I was given the answers I wanted. I was basically doing jackie chan face at the end.Fuck Odd Thomas."
"Fuck this list.Thanks OP! I've only seen The Signal and Timelapse but some of the others on this list seem great.I'm so glad Odd Thomas is on there. I saw that yesterday, my dad wanted me to see it, and it is good. Very good story, and the ending almost made me cry.Time Lapse was a mindfuck. I highly recommend it.Odd Thomas actually sucked.Some great recommendations in there that I'll have to check out. I watched Odd Thomas on Netflix though, not surprised it went unreleased for so long. The writing and directing were pretty bad, the cinematography made it look like a TV movie and as much as I like Anton Yelchin, I didn't think he was right for the character he was trying to play. The whole thing felt like a very low effort production that never tried to be anything more than a straight-to-DVD cash in. I'm surprised to see it in the list.I really enjoyed the book but the movie was so shoddily done that it actually confused me. Even if it was deliberately going for a campy tone that doesn't mean it needs to be painfully campy and I know Sommers knows the difference because he generally did a good job balancing the tone in the first mummy Personally, I loved it. Despite its numerous flawsThe worst part of Odd Thomas was the really awkward dialogue that sounded copied straight from the book with no adjustments made for matching the tone.The Signal is a great Sci-FI film. The young actors cast a shadow at first but hold up well thru out.Fishburne is great as usual.I thought The Signal was pretty lame. Just not much there. Aside from some really stunning camera work and VFX>"
"Isnt time lapse the same premise as the older bollywood movie Aah Dekha Zaara? Or are they both inspired by another source?I saw the description and the first thing I thought of was the old Twilight Zone episode A Most Unusual Camera.I'm so happy I wasn't the only one who thought that! I feel if I were to watch Time Lapse I would constantly be comparing it to that episode and ruin it for myself.I wasn't a fan of Against the Sun. I just don't find that lifeboat survival stories make for a compelling movie experience."
"If you liked Robert Redford's All is Lost this might be the movie for you. However if you weren't a fan of that, I doubt you would enjoy this one.The Signal was beautifully shot and creepy as fuck although I hated the ending. Would definitely watch it again though!none of these were wide released, were theyHow does one go about finding these movies? Like if they arent shown on tv or if I dont stumble upon a thread like this how do people discover these movies? Because some of these unknown movies are really interesting and I just dont know how to find them.nice suggestionsGreat list!An actual list that shows me something new! Amazing. I've only seen 2 of these films. Thanks for the suggestions. What is the best avenue to see these films? They aren't in theaters or on Netflix...Thanks. Some there I did not know of.  Comment to find my way back I saw Stonehearst Asylum the other day. It's pretty good. I have Odd Thomas in my Netflix queue (<<spelling?). I've never heard of the others. I'll have to check them out.Have seen the signal , odd Thomas and against the sun, all tree   good movies especially odd Thomas . maybe gonna give the others a look , good listOdd Thomas was a blind pick for me on Netflix a few months back.  It's a very well done film.  Odd Thomas has its fan base and is fairly popular at least in /r/movies. Other than that, good list.you forgot Snow Buddies the hit sequel to Air buddies, Space Buddies, Santa Buddies, Super Buddies and Spooky BuddiesCan anyone explain what's happening in that Ward's Wife screen still? Spoilers below, I'm sure.The Fed is going to be lowering rates so get your money out of T-bills and put it all into... waffles, tasty waffles; with lots of syrup.Rob The Mob is a surprisingly solid film that I watched with my folks on demand a few weeks ago. Great performances and there's A LOT of cameos anyone who enjoyed gangster movies from the late 20th century as well as The Sopranos on HBO a will enjoy. I don't want to spoil any."
"Ray Romano is also good."
"Check it out. Odd Thomas was great. Koontz is a good author. Just watched 'These Final Hours' wow would add that too the list. fantastic movie. Odd Thomas should have been a Sci-fi channel movie, or even a series. It's kind of weak but not terrible. This probably isn't the place to say this, but I just watched Rudderless the other day. And god damn that was a great movie. Never heard of any movie besides *The Signal*"
"The others sound interesting especially *Against The Sun* since I LOVE single location flicks."
"Thanks for this promising list, really looking forward to those films and luckily I am on holidays after Monday :)I wouldn't exactly say I missed them, Bob.THANK YOUOdd Thomas was surprisingly goodOdd Thomas was on Netflix not sure if it still isStonehearst Asylum looked like generic straight to video crap, surprised to see it on any list like this.I saw Sparks, it was really cool. I read that they made the film on their own- these days- that's really hard to do. I really didn't watch many movies last year.Thank youI've only seen Rob The Mob (which I enjoyed quite a bit) and a bit of Odd Thomas (which I didn't like at all).  There are a number that sound interesting,  including a few (+1, The Signal) that have been sitting in my Netflix queue for a while."
"Thanks for the list.  It's rare to pull much out of these,  but you've given me some good stuff to check out. I just checked out Stonehearst Asylum because of this list...LOVED it. Fun watch for a rainy Sunday night. Thanks, OP.Every time one of these gets posted, I'm disappointed that I've seen most of them. I don't even watch movies that much anymore. But I think I hover towards more obscure things. Is 'worthwhile' a nice way of saying 'not great, but when you've watched all the good ones these wont bore you completely to death'I really did want to see the Signal think I saw some 2001 style shots in the trailer..."
"also wtf how can they mis-promote a movie with  Kate Beckinsale, Ben Kingsley, Michael Caine,  and Brendan Gleeson like what the hell.You might also like 'coherence' if your taste is like your recommendations.  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2866360/"
"Edit sorry it's evidently a 2013 film not 2014Great movie. I watched it twice to figure out what was going onStonehurst Asylum for sure for sure. watch it if you haven't.And when the CGI is bad, it's because it wasn't budgeted properly, the director didn't know what he wanted or the post schedule was unrealistically short.  That's basically how VFX works in a nutshell and why even before CGI, there was good VFX and shit VFX for the same reasons.Looks coolThe screengrab from Let's Kill Ward's Wife is in the same living room as one of the houses used on Californication. NiceThe only one here that I've seen so far is Odd Thomas, which I rather enjoyed. Thanks for the list. I'll definitely be checking out some of the others. I'll check out some of these, but I actually saw Odd Thomas over Christmas and my whole family was laughing at how bad it was.Surprising enough I actually saw Odd Thomas. Pretty good movie. Would recommend.After reading Odd Thomas a few years ago I was just browsing Netflix's new releases when I saw it. I squealed like a fangirl and I'm a fairly large man. I looked a bit like this http://i.imgur.com/huMlv0r.jpgOdd Thomas was a rando I clicked on on Netflix and I ended up really liking it definitely worth checking outThis was my letterboxd review from April when I saw Before I Disappear in theater:"
"A few years ago, Shawn Christensen won an Oscar for his amazing live-action short called Curfew, focused on a man in despair and contemplating suicide that gets the first chance to spend time with his niece, now around 11 years old. The short was very deserving of that Oscar, and Christensen took an interesting route to build on that by starting with that same initial story and fleshing it out into a full feature length film."
"On one hand, I would like to see him go into something new with the same finesse that he showed in Curfew, and I feel like there's directions he went here that didn't feel as genuine as some aspects of the same characters in Curfew."
"On the other hand, though, he kept many of the key moments and feelings from the short, while fleshing out so much more to it. I do also very much like that Fatima Ptacek returns as Tabitha, the niece, as she had a great performance in the short, and she does just as strong of a job here. This film really wouldn't be as strong as it is without her."
"Christensen plays the lead role as well as directing, and while he's good in front of the camera, it's behind the camera that's really what impresses me. The style and flow of the short was good, but he does so much more here, and there's a very strong visual presence in so many scenes that it really sticks with me. This includes not only some of the more fanciful parts, like an expanded version of the music number from the short to simple shots, like the phone on the floor at the start of the film."
"What really strikes me is how he managed to take a short and really not dilute it when he extended it out to feature-length, and it still maintains its emotional center, and I think that shows a lot of creativity and skill as both a writer and a director. I really hope that this film does well enough that it opens the doors to more work by Christensen, although I can't help but feel that with the quality of this film, it will do so.Wow, I review movies and really try to scrape the bottom of the film barrel, but I only heard of/saw 4 of these."
"Great job, OP.well I saw one of them and I liked it so I guess I'll try the others. Comment to find laterTestified: saw only Rob The Mob.Wetlands directed by David Wnendt. Its an amazing German movie on Netflix. I highly recommend it, and I'm extremely picky with movies. May be gross to many, but it's a great psychology filmI saw Signal on a whim with my younger brother. Had no idea what it was about and was only going off a short 3 sentence synopsis off the movie theaters website. Holy shit was I blown away!"
"Best movie I had seen in years. I mean you figure things out before the end but once you do its still amazing. It also left you with wanting to know so much more about what happens after the film ends."
"I mean I like how they ended it but fuck it left me going What? WHAT HAPPENS NEXT??"
"Would seriously recommend. Odd Thomas was actually very good. I'm hoping for a sequel.I was really happy I got to see The Signal in theatres before it became UVOD. I loved it. Odd Thomas was really good.Umm, is this a list, or a bunch of screenshots?"
"It's probably, mostly due to the fact i just watched it, but i really feel that [Coherence](http://youtu.be/sEceDz1Rodc) should be among that list.Odd Thomas and The Signal were pleasant surprises. The first reminded me a lot of John Dies at the End, the second changes genres throughout the movie and leaves you wanting so much more. The Signal would of been an epic mini-series!I saw odd Thomas back in like Octobor. I thought it was a really good movie.The ending of The Signal blew my mind. Odd Thomas was actually really goodI remember being in high school and being really excited to go see the Angels and Airwaves movie. That movie was actually really awesome and visually pleasing even if the story wasn't all that great. I am excited to watch The Signal seeing that it is the same director!ForceMajeur - one of the biggest snubs of all time.SavingThe only one I saw was Force Majeure. But it's my favorite movie. Of all time.Odd Thomas was amazing.Commenting for later, ok?Nice list."
"(Obviously I'm just commenting for later but just go with it.)>The less you know about the film the better, but the title should give you some indication of what sort of a movie you're getting into."
"Well, I guess I won't be watching that one.  I think I might know the secret to how no on has ever heard of these movies.How and where do you find these movies? I actually loved odd Thomas!  it had a really good story.  Time Lapse is the only one I have seen from your list and I did enjoy it although to be honest I was barely interested when it came on. It's a thriller with a love triangle, murder, greed, and mystery into the mix.Just watched +1 based off your list and it was pretty shitI really loved Odd Thomas. That movie deserves way more recognition.Great moviesJust watched Stonehearst Asylum, and it was great! I'm glad that I clicked on this post and saw that movie! Thanks for posting this! Such a shame that it didn't get much recognition. Did anyone else turn off Lets Kill Wards wife because it was so painful to watch?I actually have never heard of these movies for once r/movies! Good job. Onto my watchlist they go!  Does the word actually have any purpose in the title? I would argue that no it has absolutely no purpose.Good list. I've only seen Rob The Mob, which I enjoyed a lot. It's ending felt a bit rushed though.A lot of these movies are on Netflix.Dammit! I bought The Signal on DVD and fucking lost it before I could watch it..."
"So pissed. It has to be somewhere in my house too.So where do people hear about the movies on this list?I thought Odd Thomas was pretty terrible.  Stonehearst Asylum is pretty good, IMO.In case you guys haven't seen Whiplash, go see it. A friend recommended it to me, otherwise I would have never heard of it. It is about a drummer, a student and a teacher. It is incredible and nominated (deservedly) for best picture.Ohhhh my. Blessings on your first born child.I watched Time Lapse, it was pretty good. I think this thread is a good place to mention **The Congress** starring Robin Wright (Princess Bride, Forrest Gump).  It's rated [6.6 on IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1821641/?ref_=nv_sr_1) (kinda low) and [74% on RT](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_congress/).  I struggled through the first 40 minutes of the movie, but am so glad I did."
"FYI, if you've never tried drugs, and want to know what it feels like without actually consuming drugs, The Congress is probably the closest you'll come.Only two films I've even heard of on that list are Odd Thomas and The Signal. I AM ASHAMED! I shall go watch all these right now!Thanks for making this man!! I got so much new movies to watch now!Excellent compilation. A couple I'd forgotten, many I'd missed entirely. Many thanks."
"Just an aside - are you a big Jim Sturgess fan?I was really starting to feel bad for Jim Sturgess reading this list."
"I could see filmmakers thinking wow - even if I make a good film, it might bomb if I put Sturgess in it.They're not bombing because Sturgess is in it as much as they're bombing because Ewan McGregor is *not*."
"In the world of film marketing, Sturgess is Poor Man's Ewan. In my opinion, he's done some quality work but he's not really a draw.Thank you!Odd Thomas is a total bore to watch, although the tear jerker at the end is genuinely brutal. These posts have seriously become: Here are some movies that I thought were really good last year, these are my recommendationsI hate how these posts are just used to start discussions about the content. What is this, some kind of online *discussion* board?only seen one of them The Signal was ok, nothing amazing, OP has a fairly stupid taste in films.Hmm, that is a great point. Honestly I hadn't ever thought about it that way before.I hated the signal...#The Signal. The Signal. The Signal.#"

I'll have to check put the rest!..Regarding #12 (Time Lapse), I'm sorry, but no time-travel movie could ever outdo Primer for me.I'm betting most of these films are just hipster shit that people pretended to like. The Signal was alright, but I would never recommend it to anyone.None of these are gay cowboys eating pudding movies (even though I enjoy them I also roll my eyes sometimes at how artsy they are and get why people dislike them). Not all of these are worth watching either but they're not the type of movies people pretend to like so they seem smart. If you're just commenting to get a reaction sorry for the more serious response and good luck with the downvotes.Why did you put 'actually' in the title, and in parenthesis noless? Seriously, this bugs the shit outa me and I dunno why. The only movie on this list that I really disliked was Odd Thomas. My father and I will argue over whether or not it is a good movie, I think the movie is very poor, he likes it quite a bit. Though while I think it is very poor, I can see the appeal and why someone might like it. The only way I can get my father to stop trying to prove this movie's worth to me is if I tell him, It was almost good, I am sure the book is much better..Time lapse is dogshit, if you enjoy laughing at stupid films then its great. cinematography wasnt awful but the acting story and plot holes were.Well you're clearly wrong it was a great and clever film.Like it"
"10 Cloverfield Lane - Official Trailer (Cloverfield sequel) Directed by Dan TrachtenbergI don't know how I'd be able to contain myself in a fallout shelter with both Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Goodman.Yeah, I don't know why but I get very happy when John Goodman is in my movies."
"He's captivating in any role (even cameos).I think you just described why you get very happy when John Goodman is in a movie.You should take up psychiatry full time. http://replygif.net/i/500.gifBasically.I wake up and suddenly theres a Cloverfield sequel that JJ has kept us completely in the dark about for years? And the teaser trailer is actually really good? And it's already filmed and coming out in March?!"
"I'm not fully convinced I'm awake yet.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPPSrteeLSQMakes me respect him even more, that HARD to do now a daysThis was the reverse of how Square Enix marketed Final Fantasy XV."
"* announce FFXV and release a demo"
"* announce FFVII remake before FFXV is released"
"* everyone forgets about FFXV, only wants FFVII remake."
"My exact thought process about this, except mine wanted her to have blue hair like in scott pilgrim. :)I thought the other thread stated it was a cousin of Cloverfield? If it's a full blown sequel I am jacked. my kind of movie!The Force is strong with JJ.You're still in REKALL. JJ Abrams is not real. Cloverfield is a dream you wanted after playing Godzilla on your gi joes on a Cloverfield...take the red pill!Well, it *is* the first pleasant news we've had all month. It'd be a shame if it was all a dream.Between this and Fallout 4 I hope people come to realize that keeping things secrets and then announcing they'll be out within months is better for everybody.I lost my shit in traffic this morning when my buddy sent me a random youtube link with no context... and now I just found out it's coming out in March? Holy shit. This is going to be a great year. I don't believe it is a direct sequel, however it's a high chance it's taking place in the same universe."
"At the end of the Cloverfield it's assumed the main two survive correct? Incorrect. They're at like the centre of a nuclear strike. If they didn't vaporize, they got crushed by bridge rubble.I was under the impression Cloverfield sucked.  Was it a good movie and I avoided it by mistake?Nah it's an awesome enjoyable movie. Go watch it!It was great if you saw it in theaters, and you knew nothing about it going in. It was a fun experience. Not sure how well it translates to home theater though, especially now years after everything has been spoiled. it was a great movie, blew godzilla out of the water imo. go rent it you'll be glad you did.Will do, thanks.  (Didn't see Godzilla either, only so many of it you can watch).and the godzilla mention was to the 2000 shitty matthew broderick one that this was comparable to (monster in nyc)"
"the new one that just came out was incredible in its own right I have it on 3d and watched it multiple times alrready. Exact same thoughts. I am in 100% after seeing that."
"Not too mention how excited I am for Danny T after watching him from the early Geekdrome days and all the way through TRS. So bad ass to see him doing so well for himself. One of the biggest movie surprises ever. The first Cloverfield remains my favorite movie theater experience. I can't wait to see this!I wish every movie did this. waiting is the hardest part. How cool would it be if we just never knew the movies being filmed until we saw a trailer?Same for me, but I'm drunk and pouring beer and pizza shits into the toilet. I hope when I wake up tomorrow this is all real.I can't be the only one who wanted this to be happen for years, Cloverfield had the most genius marketing I have ever seen for a film. For those who don't know you could actually string together the events leading up to those in movie by stringing together various pieces of information from fictional companies. Defiantly one of the best found footage films ever made! I cannot wait for this film! Holy shit.... As a Brit, I thought it was 3rd of November."
"Great news.Join us at /r/10CloverfieldLane -- a shameless plug, but I want to see what people might be able to find. I'm really hoping for a viral marketing campaign like we had in 2008. Also while we're on the subject /r/corkyromano exists. We are always awaiting the trailer for the long anticipated sequel over there.That's fantastic, what a great cinematic experience Corky Ro was. Any questions?"
"You do? You don't? You do? You don't?...uh...let me a cup of the..uh....rocky road then please....You guys want some cookies?Also, if they finally answer our prayers and give us another season of (then-called) Fox Family classic Big Wolf on Campus, r/BigWolfOnCampus is where official discussion will take place. Seriously how in the shit did JJ keep this secret?"
"Some man.[From another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/411ci3/possible_cloverfield_sequel_trailer_attached_to/cyyxpmd):"
"For much of it's production lifespan this movie may have had absolutely nothing to do with Cloverfield, and that link may have been shoehorned in with some rewrites and reshoots."
"*But maybe...*  Given the elaborate marketing around Cloverfield, it's not impossible that this was all just an incredibly elaborate scheme to get people talking about it online, ensuring a shitload of exposure. He is the master of the Mystery Box, and all shall bow before him.He didn't. This movie was filmed and completed under the name The Cellar. It was sort of thrown to the side I guess. Recently, they decided to tie it into cloverfield and prolly did a little editing. Regardless, none of the original Cloverfield people worked on this movie and JJ is only tied to it by name, not a director. JJ only pitched the idea of the original Cloverfield to parmaount, little else. The Cellar was filmed with a budget of 5m over 30 days. Cloverfield had a budget of 25m. Seems like Paramount is just utilizing the brand of cloverfield and JJ's fame to make money off a movie they already made. There are people who have already even seen the Cellar at test screenings who posted their thoughts on twitter like 4 months ago. Did they like it?The people claiming to have seen it say that it was a good movie, but no actual connections to the original. Though it's possible that the studio just left out the monster stuff to keep it under wraps.I think the less known director and alternative names like Valencia helped keep it under wraps. JJ really only has a producer cred so it couldn't have been very hard.It was also originally written and shot as something else and then there were rewrites and reshoot a that brought it into the Cloverfield universe.This annoys me quite a bit for some reason. I wonder how well the movie could have done on its own without a pre-existing franchise stamped on it.probably by going What's that, the movie that was kinda a niche cult film a few years ago, yeah I might be doing a seq- LOOK STAR WARS!*throws film reel behind the reporter's back*It was hidden all along within a film canister sitting on his desk marked Star Trek III: The Search For Whales"

"Just 5 more minutes...I never related to anything this much.Yeah, I'm on board. The simple fact they've hidden this from us months before its release is enough for me to see it. That never happens anymore. It was previously going by *Valencia*. I'd been hearing about it, being a fan of the director, but I was not expecting it to turn into this!Wouldn't be the first time a script was repurposed to fit in the same universe as a successful movie in order to guarantee some turnout.I'm interested in this. What other movies have done this?Here's a few examples http://mentalfloss.com/article/50333/6-movies-were-almost-other-moviesMost of the Die Hard movies did this if I recall, minus the last oneDie Hard With a Vengeance was adapted from a Lethal Weapon script.Which was originally a script that wasn't linked to any big franchises called Simon Says. Interesting stuff.Yeah same here. I was going to check it out anyway because of the cast and because I've been a fan of Dan since TRS, but I totally wasn't expecting this. I was pleasantly surprised by *Cloverfield* when I first saw it, and I'm really excited for this one. come check out /r/TheTotallyRadShow - the communities still going! :)Don't open that door! You're gonna get all of us killed!"

"Has the whole world gone crazy?! Am I the only one around here who gives a shit about the rules?!Shut the fuck up metalface187You're not wrong, metalface187. You're just an asshole.This is not Cloverfield this is Bowling, there are rules.If you open that door right now you are entering a world of pain my friend The noise at the end when the title shows up is the same noise the monster makes in the close up scene where TJ Miller gets eaten in the original Cloverfield. oh your right - that scene never made sense as the scale of the monster kept changing.  tall as 100 story building vs picks up on tiny human and takes whole mouth to chew."

"-"
"also definitely not the little monsters."
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jx86Td5PiloThe early plot description when it was going by The Cellar/Valencia:"
"The story follows a young woman who wakes up in a cellar after a severe car accident and fears she has been abducted. Her captor, a doomsday prepper, tells her he saved her life and that there has been a terrible chemical attack that has left the outside uninhabitable. She does not know what to believe and as tensions rise, she decides she must escape, regardless of the terrors that await outside."
"We know that after the nuke went off the monster survived, based on the post credit audio in Cloverfield."
"To me it seems like that Goodman saved the girl from her car accident prior to the monster attack. Once the attack began there was no way to get help from the outside so he took care of her."
"Edit: Also, J.J. Said its a blood relative which I suspect could mean the monster won't be the main focus, but that the parasites will be the main focal point. Since the nuke maybe they've mutated or evolved."
"Edit 2: Ok so it wasn't a nuke. They just bombed the hell out of it. Doesn't mean the parasites couldn't have rapidly evolved or mutated."
"Edit 3: So some people are bringing up the fact JJ said the monster died in an interview. Which could be true. But this is JJ after all. The master of misdirection. He's not one to come out and give you the right information. Plus that was 8 years ago. He could have changed his mind when he made the decision to tie this movie into Cloverfield. Also keep in mind even if the monster did die. Momma monster is still out there.I could be looking into it too much, but Winstead's character had an newer generation iPhone, while also having a cast thing on her leg. The first movie specifically took place in 2008."
"I do hope that whatever's going on outside is a direct result of the monster, though.But see the first movie starts with the idea that the monster was killed and that the DOD was still functional because now that film was labeled evidence owned by the US military, meaning the government should still be functional, meaning that the world shouldn't be a messed up place. If they completely ignore that detail that will be depressing.It could be that the government is still functional somewhere, but maybe big parts of the East coast or Midwest are overrun/destroyed.http://i.imgur.com/ZpesDBt.png"

Don't get me wrong I would love a great sequel & everything but of all movies Cloverfield seemed to work just because it was a one shot deal. What made the movie good for me was the mystery with the found footage formula. We got no real answers, only vague suggestions about the monster. I doubt a sequel could repeat that with the awe of the original.  Also I really like mr. Goodman but I really hope the trailer is just misdirection because the premise seems like someone slapped Cloverfield title on completely different movie. But again I hope I'm wrong..."
"EDIT: Ok, I've missed that watching the first time, but now I'm sure It's some sort of sneaky misdirection. At least I don't recall anyone shooting one location film on IMAX?JJ did say he wouldn't make a sequel unless the found the right was to do it. He didn't want to make a sequel the same as the original.Tarantino just shot a film on 70mm that takes place inside a cabin and a stagecoach . . . just sayin'."
"Something tells me the entire movie takes place in the bunker and at the end of the movie she leaves the bunker to witness a destroyed landscape infested with those parasites.Surely a film like that wouldn't justify an IMAX release though, right? Might amp up the intensity of the enclosed bunker.Well seeing that J.J. has a reputation for keeping things secret I doubt the trailer is giving away major plot point. I assume what we saw was from the first act. She has full use of both legs then, earlier she's shown with a crutch and a broken leg when she has the phone on the bed. Unless there's a huge time gap I think she comes back into the bunker after she opens the first door. I'm tempted to agree with you.  This possibility both intrigues and worries me."
"Firstly, if they go the route you've described, this would be one of the very few instances in which a sequel was vastly different than the original in terms of style and pace.  To go from a found footage film with a relatively large amount of VFX to a film that focuses on 3 people interacting in a single, cramped location would probably be the biggest leaps I've ever seen between a sequel and original. That would be interesting."
"But it has some huge pitfalls, the biggest of which being an inherently slower pace that might put off a lot of viewers.  In *Cloverfield*, there were multiple exciting set pieces: the initial attack on the city; the attack on the bridge; the parasite ambush underground; and the helicopter scene.  Inbetween these set pieces, the characters were making their way through a chaotic New York City in order to reach safety, which brings a constant sense of tension throughout the film."
"If *10 Cloverfield Lane* takes place mostly in a bunker, then we'll mostly be watching these 3 people telling us what's wrong rather than the movie showing us what's wrong.  The quality of the film will depend heavily on the strength of its actors.  This, of course, is not an inherently bad thing, but folks who are expecting something similar to *Cloverfield* might be sorely disappointed."
"I'm looking forward to watching *10 Cloverfield Lane*, but I'll be going in with tempered expectations.  If it does turn out to be 60+ minutes of 3 people in a bunker, cool.  If it turns out that the trailer was some sort of red herring and the movie is somehow much different, then even better.Personally I'm treating this like Cloverfield is now Cinematic Black Mirror."
"Every entry is a different take on a different scifi/horror genre film, maybe with easter eggs to connect all the different universes.I could live with that.Actually, she'll probably leave the bunker, realize everything is OK, move to New York, get a job as a nanny, and have a lovable black gay roomate, and end the season in a love biangle with a Vietnamese illegal alien.Peeno Noir, crushing cars, Statue of Liberty's head flew far.Cloverfield 3: Females Are Strong As Hell"
"EDIT: A triumphant and empowering tale of one MUTOs struggles to balance the needs of raising a child on her own and the day-to-day grind of world destruction, while navigating the pitfalls of a world dominated by her larger, more dangerous, male colleagues.Gwynnifer? Hi. Yeah, it's me. I can't make it. Well, tell your disappointment to suck it. I'm doing a bottle episode.Where's the PEN!!!!!!!!!!????? and who invited the dean of the air conditioning school to play LIFE^^^TM with us???I'm thinking the opposite. The trailer is only the cold open of the movie. They were pretty secretive with the first one. I doubt they'd lay out the entire movie in the first trailer this time around. I was an avid player of ARGs back then."
"I don't care what the excuse was. Ethan Haas was right.> Ethan Haas"
"http://i.imgur.com/MNQO0z5.gifYou think that they'd really pull a The Amazing Spider-Man 2 on us and show the ending in the first trailer?I doubt that's the ending. Probably somewhere near the end of the first act/beginning of the second act. She escapes and is about to run, the see's something. Parasites? A leveled New York City? And realizes he's right, and there's no where to run/go.Yeah, it's exactly the opposite of how JJ Abrams treats plot twists.My predictions (judging by her reaction in the trailer) is she'll realize he's right before she opens the door. But her presence there will maybe draw attention to them in the bunker so now escape might be the only way."
"Who knows though, I love a good trailer that keeps me guessing. Yes. I think so too, and then all of the fire and vent crawling and hand cuffed to a metal pole will take place after that scene.I think the opposite. She'll probably wake up in John Goodman's dungeon, freak the fuck out and try to escape. He'll handcuff her until she calms down. Then they make nice, have dinner and she hits him with a bottle. Hopefully the rest of the film is outside and we actually get to see the monster properly this time.I don't see that happening with as small of a budget as this film has, although that is what I would have hoped for.  Still going to see the movie but I'm trying to temper my expectations.Yep. This film definitely takes place almost entirely in that bunker. The budget was only [**$5 Million**](http://collider.com/dan-trachtenberg-valencia/). Everyone expecting another big godzilla-esque monster movie should prepare to be disappointed.After cloverfield came out a lot of people were saying wouldn't it be cool to have more cloverfield movies but from different perspectives that's what I think blood relative means; has nothing to do with the characters of the first but is set at the same event."
"I think this will be taking place a week or two after the bombing. I believe JJ was the one that said something like this... he thought the moment on the bridge when we see another person with a camera, wouldn't it be cool to see a whole movie from THAT guy's perspective on the attack...  Sounds like the tv series The Unbreakable Kimmy SchmidtIt's a miracle! they alive damn itit kinda does lol, or that episode of south park where cartman tricks butters into thinking the world ended so he can go to casa bonitaI'd love for someone who has never seen or if possible ever heard of south park to read your comment. Or [Retreat](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1410051/) with Cillian Murphy and Thandie Newton.You made those names up.All names are made up if you think about it. Too early for that manThey used an MOAB."
"Massive Ordnance Air Blast I think."
"I religiously researched the film back in the day. The MOAB leaves no residual radiation, as it doesn't use any, so if anything those parasites from NY would've just been completely vaporised rather than mutated."
"Unless, however, they happened upon some Slusho.Well, the main ingredient to slusho is under the ocean way off the coast of New York I always thought MOAB was Mother Of All Bombs. No no no, it's Mother of All BloonsMother of all Bombs is a backronym I believe.You're a backronym.That would make sense. The parasites would be cool to see evolved. But damn I hope we see another monster though!J.J. has said in the past that the monster we saw was only a baby, and that it has a bigger, meaner mother out there somewhere. I'd love to finally see its mother.What he said was taken out of context. He didn't say the monster was a baby, i.e. it's an infant with a mother."
"*Page designed the creature as immature and suffering from separation anxiety. He compared the creature to a rampaging elephant, saying there's nothing scarier than something huge that's spooked.*"
"*Page said of the creature's backstory, For me, one of the most key moments in our collective brainstorming was the choice to make the creature be something that we would empathize with. It is not out there just killing. It is confused, lost, scared. It's a newborn.*"
"*Reeves described the creature's reaction to its surroundings thus: It's this new environment that it finds frightening. To indicate this, Reeves suggested the addition of white in the creature's eyes so it would look similar to a spooked horse.*"
"*Director Matthew Reeves said the creature had been down there in the water for thousands and thousands of years.*"
"It is metaphorically a newborn. It wakes up after thousands of years and freaks out because it has zero experience in its new environment.Clover Field 2: How I Met Your Mother. Sign me up. Mama Cloverfield getting revenge on America for nuking Baby Cloverfield to death would be the best thing ever."
"God I'm pumped for this. Im hoping for some of the parasites. That scene with them in the subway tunnels in the first is soooo fucking good. Could you imagine a scene with a parasite loose in that bunker? Ugh I need this in my life> for nuking Baby Cloverfield to death"
"But it survived.Well it will be soon, it's very ill.i feel fine!No you're not. You'll be stone-dead at any moment.I feeeel happpyyy!Calling it: this is Frog Fractions 2.Don't get my hopes up like that.WindjammersCloverfield is the best old movie of 2015 and also most likely to be Frog Fractions 2. What a time to be alive.These GB references made me nerd out a bit. I love the direction that they decided to go with this. Ditching the first person camera  for a more traditional style set within the same world.  It looks fucking good.Time to rewatch Cloverfield to get ready for this!Im a fan of the more traditional take too, the first one was interesting but this looks great!To me Cloverfield going into that direction is a great choice. It would've been a shame if they would've come out with another handheld camera shaky cam thing where they're getting chased by a big, never fully seen monster. You see the whole monster multiple times in Cloverfield, once when they're in the helicopter and at the very end is the money shot.More than that too, some good shots of it being attacked/fighting the military, on the news, charging at them when they save Beth, and more. They're quick, but effective. The monster is more present in his film than Godzilla was in Godzilla.Dan becomes a man! Finally!"
"The trailer looks pretty cool.Yes! I scrolled down looking for some TRS mentions. I'm glad it's high up. Go Dan! Shoutout to TRS! /r/TheTotallyRadShow the communities still going!"
"Dan **IS** the man now!Oh wow! You're right the sub is more active than I would have thought. Ya that is a surprise. They should do a reunion show sometimeI was looking for someone to comment about that. I had to look it up to make sure it was him. Hopefully this movie actually goes through! Fuck yeah, was waiting for something from him since TRS shut down shop and it was reported that he had a development deal somewhere."
"Fucking pumped for him. JJ is a marketing god.He totally used TFA to blindsind everyone on other Bad Robot projects. Didn't even want to make Star Wars. Just did it as a misdirection.Classic JJ.Wow. The beginning of the trailer really pulled from *Lost* there. I knew they were in some sort of shelter even before it was obvious simply because it reminded me so much of the hatch scene with Desmond.That's the vibe I got from it."
"One of my favorite scenes from lost. I was almost expecting the jukebox to play Maaake your own kind of music...I love ya, Penny.I've always loved yaThe trailer is incredibly effective. Manage to show great performances without giving too much away. No reason to watch anymore more trailers for this one, definitely one I'm going to see. What a big surprise as well! They already filmed it!In theaters and IMAX"
"So, they've gotta go outside right? A low budget movie taking place entirely in a cellar would not be released in IMAX?There has to be more than that... That was a good trailer.. Damn those sneaky bastards :) It's a classic J.J. mystery box trailer. He has to open the box at some point for his shtick to work. My theory is the trailer only shows us the cold open/first act of the movie. Sounds almost as crazy as filming a movie in glorious 70mm panavision that takes place entirely in either a stage coach or a small inn.That was to show everyone in the background. Made it feel almost like a play. And it worked. I thought it was really nicely composed. The depth is great and you can see everything going on simultaneously. I watched a fairly decent stream of it a few days later online and while the quality obviously wasn't straight from blu ray or anything, it still detracted from not being able to see all the fine details.  If John Goodman can handle Roseanne Barr that monster should be no problem.Damn son the 90's called they want their references back.Well the jerk store called and they're running out of you!What's the difference? You're their all-time best seller.Except Dan died on that show.[deleted]Classic misdirection. JJ signs on to direct one of the most anticipated movies of all time and while we are all Googling Star Wars set photo leaks and asking him about Luke Skywalker he's secretly producing a sequel to Cloverfield. Ah yes, classic."

">Oh sure, I'll be happy to direct the new Star Wars."
"[Disney execs leave room]"
">Mh..."
">Muah hahaha!"
">BWAH HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!"
"> **I CAN FINALLY PRODUCE CLOVERFIELD 2!!!!!!!!**JJ's a nerd man I don't doubt that, while he was super pumped for Star Wars, he also got a bit excited to be able to do CLOVERFIELD in secret.Dan Trachtenberg from The Totally Rad Show? That is fantastic!I was more excited by the fact that Dan is directing a major film than the film itself. My friends and I would get together and watch Diggnation every Saturday, followed by TRS. http://www.10cloverfieldlane.com/"
"This website is in the youtube description. Nothing there as of right now. Could end up being a viral site. Probably just the movie website. But I can't wait for the viral marketing to begin. Hell it probably has already, just nobody's found anything yet.I wouldnt be surprised at all if there was a fresh update sitting on one of those old viral sites. I'm expecting some sort of viral marketing presence soon. 1-18-08.com  the one with the pictures is no longer. Was sad to see that. But I guess it's time to begin daily revisiting all those fan sites, dedicated to figuring it all out, once again. Not that I'm complaining.Co-written by Damien Chazelle!The and in the credits indicates that he either wrote an original draft or rewrote the script, rather than working as a writing partner on it, which would be shown by a & - WGA credits are weird.How on earth did JJ manage to keep this all a secret? Was this filmed concurrently with Star Wars?He didn't direct it. He's just the producer. Still pretty wild that no one knew it was happening. It had a code name (*Valencia*) but there had been rumors circling around that it was a sequel to Cloverfield."
"Still, they did really well at keeping this thing secret as hell. They did, just under a different name.Well it's still cool!No! You're not allowed to be excited for stuff around these parts.Also, in case people don't realize this, he produced the first one but didn't direct it either; it was directed by Matt Reeves (director/writer of the remake *Let Me In*, director of *Dawn of Planet of the Apes*, & director/co-writer of the upcoming *War for the Planet of the Apes*)Exactly, why do people in this thread keep going on about JJ Abrams?"
"Like don't they realize he's just the producer?"
"He didn't direct it. He didn't even write the script. Drew Goddard did."
"It would be like giving credit to Jon Landau for Titanic and Avatar and not James Cameron."
"Seriously, what the fuck?Well, to be fair, a lot of times producers like J.J. Abrams have a lot of creative control in guiding a project, so I believe he does deserve some credit, but the actual product has other people involved who should be considered."
"I'm a big fan of Goddard so I'm sad he isn't involved but I am curious based on the trailer and don't know enough about the new writer(s) and director to make a judgement until I see more=)From what i've read, all JJ Abrams really did in the first Cloverfield was pitch it to Paramount. JJ is great at putting his name on things.  Most people don't even know he only worked on the pilot episode of LOST, but they think he had a hand in the entire series.I bet this is totally radWhat the hell?"
"There's a Cloverfield sequel coming out?"
"What parallel earth did I wake up in...I was 12 when I saw Cloverfield in theaters, and it remains one of my personal all time favorites. I'm beyond excited for this. I was 20, Cloverfield doesn't seem that old of a movie."
"Damn Reddit has been making me feel old lately.11 back in the day."
"I can honestly say I have *never* been as immersed in a film as I was on that day, even with other found footage pictures. The relatively organic script, the acting, the CGI, the coherent.. reality of it all."
"It was honestly an experience that I may never get to relive again."
"Even though this is a blood relative to Cloverfield, I doubt that I will be able to experience that again, but.. Knowing that there's a sequel to it? That it lives on? Fucking incredible.I was 14, and it was rated 15 in UK cinemas. Sneaking into it, I felt like such a badass at the time.damn just imagine, 8 years now youre 20 years old for this. it was like the time the last godzilla movie came out in 2004, and by 2014 we finally got another godzilla movie and im already in college. damnI just remember the Godzilla trailer screensaver you got with Windows. I would play space pinball and let it go to the screen saver just to watch the trailer. The secrecy of the filming of this makes me think of when Blair Witch Project was released. Exciting."
"Pasting /u/nemt comments from another post"
">It was unfinished for a long time because this movie was originally part of Paramount's Insurge Division(source: http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/paramount-downgrades-low-budget-insurge-783745), which was a sector of Paramount devoted to low budget films made for 5 million or less. The Insurge divison collapsed and folded up and this film(when it was originally called Valencia) was caught in limbo with no studio home. Eventually it was grabbed up by Paramount again and new scenes were written in by Dan Casey to connect the film to the Cloverfield universe so it would actually make some money in theaters. Those new scenes/reshoots were shot in in March 2015 and they've spent the last year editing and adding effects. I'm starting to get a real funny feeling about this film the more and more I dig around. The original script, the fact that none of the original Cloverfield crew are involved(aside from JJ), and the fact that Paramount is releasing a film with a 5 million dollar budget in IMAX, is beginning to seem like a big cash grab for Paramount to make a few quick bucks off of an orphaned movie that they bought up. Here's some more info about the film in its original state: http://logins.specscout.com/homepage.php?mod=screenplay&smod=coverage&cmd=cvgd&sp_id=287"
"I'm not sure how I feel about this film, I mean the trailer looked great but having Cloverfield just tacked on leaves me a sour taste in my mouth.If that's the case then it's very likely the entire movie (or at least the first two acts) will take place in the bunker, which is sort of a bummer. I'd be happy if even half the movie took place post that final scene in the trailer. I don't think this will feature a monster at all. What if Cloverfiled Lane is just a framing device for all kinds of freaky shit? One movie is a Monster movie, one is a weird abduction film, one might be about ghosts, one might be about time travel and on and on...."
"Maybe Cloverfield is just the title that Bad Robot will use when they surprise drop low budget genre movies?Anthologies seem to be all the rage right now. Definitely could be. The noise when the title pops up in the trailer is the same noise the monster makes in the first Cloverfield. It's gonna be in there.I knew I wasn't the only one to hear that. You can't really hear the roar itself, but the vibrato it produces is so damn recognizable.You're saying the Cloverfield is a place in the same regard that the Twilight Zone is a place?"
"I like anthologies, and I like that idea. But it was never marketed as such and people will go in expecting a monster movie and be disappointed that it's not.The original Cloverfield was too big of a success to diverge too far I think. Plus it's been so long that they have to realize what people will actually want.Yeah the mythos of Cloverfield is too intriguing to abandon. I want to see what a giant underwater creature does to an environment after a period of time. Maybe it becomes sort of like an above ground ocean floor with larger parasite type creatures. Chills. This looks incredible. I don't even need to see any monsters. The thought of a psychological thriller starring John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead that's set in a bunker sounds amazing. Can't wait.It depends on what you want. If you want something chill go to a smaller one. If you want excitement go to a large oneTrailer reminds me of the start of Lost series two, with Desmond in the hatch.This looks amazing. John Goodman AND Mary Elizabeth Winstead in a Cloverfield sequel. Wow."
"I was confused at the beginning, with the feel good music and warm ambience of the trailer. I thought, 'the fuck?'. And then it got better. Looking forward to this.I watched Dan Trachtenberg as the awkward kid on the Totally Rad Show. I followed him through his post TRS years and his still-born directorial debut for Y:The Last Man. I was so proud of the dude when he put out the Portal short that got him so much attention (possibly even the reason he was signed to direct this). I've seen his social media posts about a little movie he was doing called Valencia. Little did I or anyone else know what he was really up to.  I'm beyond happy for him that he's landed something this big! I can't wait to see how he does in the big show!Equal parts confused and intrigued. This trailer certainly didn't suffer from giving-the-whole-movie-away syndrome.Dan fucking Trachtenberg?! Seriously? Good for him!The cast for this is perfect! John Goodman seems like he can play a great crazy guy. John Gallagher Jr. was fantastic in Short Term 12, though obviously overshadowed by Brie Larson. And if you haven't seen Faults, please watch it, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is magical.Somebody sure knows how to keep a secret!Not gonna lie, Cloverfield was one of the few found footage films I genuinely enjoyed and I'm kind of sad the sequel won't be reprising the style, but this trailer has proven that they're going to be doing a lot with the concept and I'm excited. Cloverfield was one of the first and best uses I'd seen of the Mystery Box viral marketing style, and I spent so much time looking and conspiracy videos that tried to figure out the origin of the monster. Seeing this gives me chills. I'm in the minority, but Cloverfield is actually one of my favorite movies. Yay for Dan! Don't know if anyone else is an old Totally Rad Show fan, but I'm glad that he's finally directing a big AAA title.Suddenly, the first Cloverfield has turned into a horror classic in everyone's mind."
"Still excited for this moving, but I'm definitely hedging my expectations.I really hope this does well. I'd like to see more movies have marketing like this."
"Even if there was no Cloverfield connection this looks pretty interesting, though that connection takes this from a check it out on Netflix type movie to must watch for me.I hate that this is a good teaser just like the first movies trailer."
"You get nothing but intrigue. If it is the Cloverfield sequel why does it look like a vault like in Fallout? Because this is after the monster apocalypse, duh. https://i.imgur.com/e4OBC0G.gifI have nothing of substance to add to this thread. I just feel the need to express my extreme excitement over this announcement.No more shakeycam? Yay!The real surprise is that Roseanne is going to be the monster this time and is trying to eat Dan.Retro music. Pressing buttons. Mysterious light from a hatch."
"Yeah, this is going places."
"*\excited noises*I wanna see John Goodman alone."
"This has me hyped.Co-written by Damien Chazelle from Whiplash."
"Starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead."
"I haven't been this hyped for a film in a while.ok i like this and didnt expect this to fucking happen !!! oh wowSo why didn't they have this as a trailer to Starwars instead of some shitty Michael Bay movie that no one is going to see?John Goodman appears to really bring it. And MEW is in it?!! Thanks JJ!! I loved the first film and i love the direction they have taken with this, the secrecy and not spoiling what it looks like outside i cannot wait!!"
"EDIT SPOILER:"
"I think the fact the ending of Cloverfield left us thinking if the monster stayed alive what has it done to everyone and the landscape and they used this brilliantly for the trailer where we only got a peek at whats the aftermath!As if I didn't already love JJ enough from last month, this month he drops this on us. So excited.Huh, the trailer started out with me thinking the hell does this have to do with the first Cloverfield? Then, all of sudden I was like oh shit. This looks fantastic.  What a great trailer. No matter how the movie turns out, this was amazing."
"I think people expecting this to be Cloverfield 2 are in for a disappointment. It looks like a bottle film, which doesn't give much room to make an elaborate giant monster movie; especially considering the short production time and the close release date."
"Looks awesome, though.I wake up and this just exists? I've been waiting for this for years! Join us over at /r/10CloverfieldLane!So pumpedPeople are saying that by the trailer the movie might not have a monster at all. Let me say this: A team that can successfully hide an entire movie during production can certainly hide the plot in a trailer.I can't wait. Cloverfield is one of my favorite movies. And, Goodman is just icing on the cake.huh.. for the first half of the trailer I was like Oh, nice troll reddit. At least we get a new John Goodma- holy shit what is happening?!"
"I'm more than curious now :)Scenes cut from Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt? Mary Elizabeth Winstead. WinSomething's coming -- Damn, right! And it's a Cloverfield sequel, bitch!**I am so fucking in.**So... is it a lion?JJ said it's not a direct sequel, but a [blood relative.](http://www.slashfilm.com/10-cloverfield-lane-trailer-cloverfield-2/)...you had me at John Goodman.  Take my money.Very, very excited about Dan Trachtenberg being involved. Have kept up with him since his days with the Totally Rad Show.

"Voltron confirmed!Even if this wasn't related to Cloverfield, that trailer was fucking fantastic. And those three actors have incredible dramatic / comedic range."
"Loved the shit out of the first one, I'm on board. For anyone that doesn't know, the director made a short about Portal called Portal: No Escape. For some reason I see similarities in themes for the Half-Life universe and Lost, and Lost and Cloverfield"
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4drucg1A6XkI KNEW i knew the name Dan Trachtenburg somewhere....[the man thinks with portals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4drucg1A6Xk)....I'm all in.Dan Trachtenberg's **Portal** short. [Portal: No Escape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4drucg1A6Xk)I loved the TotallyRadShowNow that's how you do a goddamn trailer. The movie could be really cool. This trailer in particular makes me think a lot of the Season 2 opener of lost. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOA4OaGovqk"
"edit - Oh and if you still haven't watched Lost and are going to, don't watch this due to spoilers. Let the clue-hunting begin! They punched the numbers 4 8 1 3 on the jukebox. What could it mean?This is how movie trailers should be. Nobody knew they were making a sequel, out in a couple months from releasing the trailer, and great trailer editing. John Goodman is the cherry on top. Liking the LOST vibe of this trailer.Although I may be the only person, I loved Cloverfield! I had a really great theatre experience watching it the first time, and have watched it a number of times since and enjoyed each viewing. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think J.J. or anyone else involved with the movie intended for this to be related to Cloverfield until quite recently. The fact that the film had two previous titles, a lower budget, and seemingly has none of the key elements of the original Cloverfield (i.e first person POV) makes me suspicious that its connection to Cloverfield is simply a last minute revision by the marketing team to cash in on the popularity of an already established cult hit. Maybe they were able to keep the film hidden for so long because they noticed some thematic parallels with Cloverfield and decided to throw the name on the movie."
"With that in mind, I'm still gonna watch this movie, just not with huge expectations. Is http://cloverfieldclues.blogspot.com/?m=1 website making a comeback?!?Remind me of this"

Don't know why others didn't. Man when the viral marketing campaign of the first Cloverfield was released, I was one of those people deeply invested in the whole backstory between the company Tagruato and their deep sea drilling which unearthed the Cloverfield monster and it's kin. It was pretty fucking amazing."

RAD!!John muthafukkin' Goodman. I love that man. This is gonna be good.I like these and it's coming out soon announcements. Oh yeeeeah, those are the 'amazing trailer goosebumps' I crave...Awesome! I love that the release date is so close too. Getting sick of trailer for movies that are still over a year away. Looking at you Batman v Superman.

Holy shit I've been waiting for this to be announced for years and it's out in two months?? How the fuck did this not get out? Crazy, man.How do we know it's a sequel? I saw an article saying it's just in the Cloverfield world, so it may not have a strong relation to what we saw in the first.I used to be a director with Dan at Tight Films and Gartner when we were both doing commercials. Super nice guy, talented and driven. OMG!I have never seen the original Cloverfield but this trailer looks good and has me interested. Is the original just as interesting?To add my voice to the throngs, YES CANNOT WAITMan I'm glad this sequel has just landed so out of the blue. And that its out in March! When cloverfield came out I didn't have internet and wasn't really surrounded by the advertising campaign for slusho etc!I remember that Dan Tratchenberg got signed on to direct something right after his Portal short film blew up on the internet."
"It had a different name, though. I assume that it was just a code name and it was actually this movie the entire time?JOHN MOTHER FUCKING GOODMAN.its a voltron movieThis is pretty much a +/- impression in my book, considering how it has nothing to do (that we know of) with *Cloverfield*. I sincerely hope they don't do some B-grade slasher horror schlock, which already seems to be the case with John Goodman.The director of Whiplash, Damien Chazelle, helped with the screenplay for this. A good sign to me.FUCK YES! Also, apparently Damien Chazelle did part of the screenplay, possibly a first draft.If anything, I'm looking forward to the viral marketing / possible ARG more than I am the actual movie."
"So many memories with the old Cloverfield stuff."
"/r/hailcorporateThat ARG is still probably the best ever made.It's a lion!Although this isn't Cloverfield 2 and it's without a big monster, I'm still excited. It looks good."

">>@DrewAtHitFix If it's 'Valencia' with a new title, then it's not Cloverfield 2. Saw a preview a few months ago, and it's big twisty fun.2016 is a great year for movie fans!Cloverfield was one of the best Godzilla type movies IMO. It really captured large, alien invasion terror so well.YES!!!!!!!Calling it now. Star Wars Episode X directed by Dan Trachtenberg.Wow, kept secret for all this time, especially in today's digital age is crazy. I've been waiting for this since the second I stepped out of the theater in 2008. Cannot wait for this!Directed by Dan Trachtenberg from TRS? Whoa, so cool!I almost shit myself when I read Dan Trachtenberg.  To see him go from TRS to this... WTF?!?  They reviewed the original Cloverfield on the damn show for Thor's sake.Feels like we'll be left with no answers again.Holy shit!  Directed by Dan Trachtenberg?  I've been wondering what happened to him.  I know when TRS stopped he was set to direct Y the last man and every since that fell through have been waiting to hear anything on him.  Makes me even more excited to see this.At first I balked at the idea of this Cloverfield sequel, but now that I know John Goodman is in it I might actually see it."
"Which is perhaps the only reason he is in it. Kind of like Bryan Cranston in Godzilla.I literally couldn't stop during the laughing during the trailer because of how excited this makes me. The original was my favorite movie experience ever. BRING ON ANOTHER ARG! BRING ON THE SLUSHO!OH. MY. GOD! And directed by Dan Trachtenberg???!!! Dan has become a man. TRS for life.You had me at the 'bad robot' thingy.Well don't that kick a little ass! I really enjoyed Cloverfield. Now the sequel has Mary Elizabeth Winstead AND John Goodman? This will be good. this looks more like The Divided than Cloverfield. I'm super hyped about thisI'll see anything John Goodman is in. I even saw Monument Men.Did you see love the coopers? It was worse. This is a fallout shelter, there are rules!Did a podcast talking about it this morning."
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIbj3P1M19URamona Flowers <3I love that while everyone was losing their shit over star wars, Abrams was making this in secret. Loved Cloverfield ,so hyped for this.Now I have to watch cloverfield. Is this the Dan t from the totally rad show?FINALLY!!!!!!"
"The question is, will Slusho be a factor in this one?Is this real life? I hope they do the marketing campaign like they did for the last movie and create web pages to give a sense of mystery."
"http://www.slusho.jpmicheal bay made a good movie and theres a cloverfield sequel? am i coming out of a coma or something?Wow, this looks a lot more compelling than Cloverfield. It is a good sign that this is not a direct sequel. It is an independent story from the original.I really want this to be good because I loved the first film. THIS LOOKS FUCKING AWESOME!!!!!!!!!! I love any movie with Robin Pecknold as well!Quality trailer right thereThat song was really spot-on perfect for that trailerI absolutely cannot believe this is a real thing. I couldn't be more excited I'm surprised everyone thinks that her opening the door is the ending, I'd say her opening the door is about 1/4 of the movie in, maybe half way."
"Idk I just want to see some monsters, manThe director JJ chose is the same one who directed that short [Portal: No Escape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4drucg1A6Xk)... will he collaborate with JJ on a Portal movie in the future? Perhaps this movie is a bit of a test run for Dan Trachtenberg?THIS is what we need more of. Surprise/secret trailers and movies! I'm fucking excited!Wow, this is a surprise. At a Q&A I attended last year, Sherryl Clark, the executive producer of Cloverfield, said that there was no sequel in the works and that the idea was buried years ago. Either she isn't involved with this one, or this was an extremely well kept secret.wait what? this looks insaneAs a British redditor who needs to see this film, the release date was momentarily disappointing!Also, Damien Chazelle, the writer/director of Whiplash is credited as a screenwriter, so there's thatFor some reason (probably the Jameson), I opened this up thinking it was going to be a cloverfield/21 jumpstreet crossover. Pleasantly surprised.This is great.  I loved the first movie and it was highly underrated.So excited for John Gallagher Jr. He remains one of my favorite Broadway actors and he seems to be really getting some more exposure. He also just released a solo album this month. Sometimes I like to pretend that **The Mist** takes place in the same universe as **Cloverfield**.I really hope all of that happens in the first 10 minutes and we get a bunch of crazy grandiose monster destruction and shit for the rest of the movie. I just texted my SO and told her we can finally go see another movie!"
"Cloverfied is the only movie we've ever gone to in the time since we've been together.Anyone know the song in the trailer?No shaky cam? Count me interested. TRS!!! I'm pretty damn excited for this. The sequel I always wanted and it comes as a total surprise. I wish more films would do this. Huge props to JJ.Really excited about this.  Everytime I see the trailer though, I can't help but think that when I see the scene of Mary Elizabeth Winstead on the couch with the short black hair and purple shirt, that she looks like Ariel Winter's Dora the Explorer (https://www.google.com/search?q=ariel+winter+dora&biw=853&bih=519&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=0ahUKEwjD_5eHxqzKAhWGNiYKHQFqBPoQ_AUIBigB).  I'm so happy people are as excited as me for this. I really hope it's not just for the namesake Anything with John Goodman is great.I think I was 13 when the first one came out. I'd spend alot of time in the bathroom researching clues about the movie. Everyone though I was masterbating...I know this now. Not one braaam, That alone has me 50% more interested.Yay Dan!!!! still miss TRS, but good to see him rocking it elsewhere.Can't wait to see it. First part was awesome. I'm so glad it's not another Found-Footage movie, they get so dull after awhile."
"But, I will admit Cloverfield did this exceptionally well. To the point where it was very unnerving seeing the monster at first, at least in theaters.This was a nice surprise. Oh my fuck.This is great. The original Cloverfield I didn't enjoy because I knew so much about it going in. I'll just watch this trailer and wait till March. This is a great trailer.What an amazing track, all the way hype for this movie.I can't wait.  I enjoyed the first oneThe Cellar would have been an overlooked low-budget film that would make back its budget eventually. By revealing that it is/re-writing it to be Cloverfield 2, this movie went from a weak box-office haul of maybe $5-10 million to... a lot more.Go Dan Trachtenberg!Sneaky of them to use the alias The Cellar for the movie title until finally unveiled as Cloverfield 2."
"Trailer looks awesome! I enjoyed the first film a lot. Creature feature!Anyone else catch the monster audio effect towards the very end of the trailer?Anybody ever watch the sci-fi anthology series *Metal Hurlant Chronicles*?  Especially the episode Shelter Me starring Michelle Ryan and James Marsters? They look awfully similar, but that one had ambiguity to the situation up until the end that I guess this one can't really have since they put Cloverfield in the title.What version of the song is this? Now thats a well made trailer. Didn't reveal too much to give too much away but just enough to draw me in.The crazy thing is that, if this movie was REALLY just about these guys trapped in a shelter and trying to escape Goodman's character; the trailer pretty much showed us everything from beginning to end. Them being content at first, things slowly escalating until they need to escape and then, to top it all off; we see her actually escaping!"
"So, since's there's no way they would show their hand so much in the first teaser trailer and the movie's supposed to be connected to Cloverfield...what the fuck is this movie really about, then?"
"God damn it, I want to see this now.I didn't know exactly what I was expecting but this certainly wasn't it. Can't wait to see it.I'm so hyped for this movie. It looks incredible. In one trailer, they summed up the tension of being trapped between the Clover, and John Goodman."
"Seriously, this looks awesome, and the music is awesome. It only makes sense that they play Crimson and Clover sometime in the movie.I'm sold! Apart from Batman v Superman almost all the trailers lately have been pretty good. Showing the right amout to get you interested but not enough so it makes you feel like you have seen the whole movieJohn Goodman looks real fuckin severe in this. I'm looking forward to this movie and this is literally the first I've heard of it.It was literally fully revealed last night, prior till then it was going by *Valencia* and no one saw this coming!"
"John Goodman is gonna be so awesome in this!Gimme details where was it revealed ? For once I'm not out of the loop about a new movie! :DI've never watched the original Cloverfield movie, but this looks really, really good. I love the way the trailer is made, gives you just enough. Needless to say, I'm hooked.Damn, JJ you're one smart dude keeping this a secret for so long. I'm excited but apprehensive. On one hand, I usually really don't like it when a sequel to those found footage movies does the thing where it's the same events but from a different group's perspective, but this time it looks like the group has some insider-knowledge on the monster so seeing their story might be pretty interesting. That is, if this is the kind of sequel we're going to be seeing in the first place."
"So, we have to wonder now. Is the idea that the Cloverfield Monster was just a baby true? Are we going to see a proper evolution of all the ideas that were in Abram's first Cloverfield? Jeez we only have to wait a couple of months to find out. I like the fact I don't know what this film is about jj got me convinced that I can enjoy movies can exist without Huge spoilersFinally! I've been waiting for this since the first movie when you can see another baby drop off in the distance (or at least that's what it looked like). I figured a sequel would come. Update: It's a Star Wars, Cloverfield, Star Trek cross-over.Fucking John Goodman, why does he have to look so much like my dad :(What a great trailer. I expect a lot of people walking out of this movie pissed expecting that it was gonna be Cloverfield 2The director of this film went to college where I'm currently studying film!wow, I did think I'd find myself wanting a sequal to the first movie, but that trailer tickles all of my happy spotsSuspense, I love it. Please keep it goingJohn Goodman and no shaky cam? Ok I'm interested.Can somebody explain why people are so excited over this film? I thought people didn't like the original?Ok I'm excited for this. It's totally rad that Dan's directing this. So pumped for this. Let's go!!!So years.after the NYC incident the mutants/ creatures have infested the state? Country?  World?"
"Is it years or weeks, or days after?  So many questions...."
"I have to see it to know.  But if not wasn't working this thread, I would have never guessed it.was.a.sequal.Dan still hiding away from Roseanne after all these years.I can't wait to see this movie.What if the song they're playing on the jukebox isn't i think we're alone now? That's just the song on the trailer, and I've never heard a slowed down version like that before. I highly doubt he's playing I think we're alone now on repeat while living in a bunker. I think we need to figure out what song number 4813 really is.I also just want to take a moment and point out OP's screen name to everyone. It really caught me off guard and made me laugh out loud for a second."
"http://i.imgur.com/2dPuX.gifSooo... A Fallout movie!"
"Awesome!"
"On a serious note: FINALLY! I feel like I was the only one waiting for a sequel to this film!We already had a Fallout movie. It was called The Book of EliWar never changesAnother settlement needs your help, General!Shut the fuck up, Preston Garvey.J.J. ABRAHMS! OUTTA NOWHERE! BAWH GOD,KING!I know I'm in the tiny minority but I'm really disappointed it's not POV.The tagline is Monsters come in many forms. The original Cloverfield was about 9/11, this trailer appears to be hinting that it takes place in the post-Cloverfield world. Based on the tagline, I posit that there will be no Cloverfield monster at all, and John Goodman is the monster and it's an allegory for how 15 years after 9/11 there hasn't been a major terrorist attack but we're all still afraid of terrorism and blah blah blah the real bad guys are middle american prepper types. Couple this with the rumors that this movie was produced independently of anything cloverfield and then had a few references added in late and the word Cloverfield slapped in the title to make it a spiritual sequel or whatever.This movie better not just be 4 peoples tuck in a bunker. I mean, that's fine for its own movie, but a Cloverfield movie needs monsters destroying cities.Lizzy Caplan from the original and Mary Elizabeth Winstead from the sequel:"
"http://imgur.com/P7M5HQu.jpgthey both have the same horrible hairstylist.Am I the only person that feels like j.j. is over hyped and super full of himself? Why is everyone so excited about this film? The first film was just generally 'OK'. **JJ Abrams DIDNT MAKE THIS MOVIE**"
"Bad Robot employs lots & lots of talented people. Most of them are not JJ Abrams."
"JJ has kinda been busy with Star Wars lately"
"This movie has lots of people working on it, & again, most all of them are not JJ Abrams. So? He didn't make the first one eitherThis and 'Green Room' teasers are both short and sweet. Love it!I have never seen Cloverfield but damn if that isn't one of the best trailers I have seen. I am going to avoid the rest of promotional material and go into this one blind. OH MY FUCKING GOD HOLY FUCKING SHIT IT IS FINALLY FUCKING HAPPENING"
"I AM SO FUCKING HAPPY RIGHT NOWI am so happy to see John Candy work again. People are going to be do pissed if the whole movie is the bunker. It could really, really backfire putting Cloverfield in the title. Roseanne will be the Cloverfield monster.*Cloverfield* is one of those movies I have a love/hate relationship to.  I love it just as it is, it's a fun watch as an urban survival movie."
"The hate comes from the world building that JJ Abrams always seems to do that tends to fall flat on it's face because none of it makes any sense.  Which wouldn't be a problem in itself except for the fact that 90% of the chatter around this movie now is about the last movie and this mythology built up around it.  The 'it's still alive', the satellite, the original monster was only a baby, etc.  Unnecessary questions.  We saw all this happen in *Alias* and *Lost*, and they didn't make them better, only worse.  And the fact that JJ uses this monster model in so much stuff means he has some weird fetish for it."
"Contrast that to mysterious worlds like in 'Mad Max' where we don't get a lot of answers either, but George Miller isn't concocting a bunch of macguffins in the mean time."
"Are there more stories in this universe that should be persued?  Sure, just don't flesh out the world with more mystery that isn't ever going to be touched on and is irrelevant to the story to begin with.Hopefully its in Real-3d so we can see John Goodman's stomach rolls bulge into our faces as he sits in a bunker for 90 minutes.No found footage. YayAm I the only one who thought cloverfield was pretty mediocre?"
"I saw it when it released. I think my issue was that at some point the destruction was so conveniently following the protagonists around that I was getting annoyed. I also remember the end with them under the bridge being kind of teen-romantic-horror, but it's been a while."
"I should probably give it another shot.This looks like it's totally different, and is like a post-apocalyptic thing that takes place after the monsters have taken over. I think the first one was setting up for this one. 10cloverfieldlane.com is up and running! weirdly blurry. haven't found a way in yet.So much hype but it's on a 5m dollar budget..  Do you guys think most of the film will be shot in the bunker? I hope not :(Room 2Was hoping Matt Reeves would direct this but not knowing anything about Trachtenberg I hope he does a good job.Trailer reminds of something."
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_5ZQW0BCFU"
"EDIT: Remembered JJ produced both. No harm, it's a great device.[Michelle's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfmswP3XaWk) Dad?they're prob the same ageGoogle won't give me any information."
"IMDB is a dead end too.Pretty sure this is like The Divide but PG-13. The Divide was a surprise to me, well director amazingly acted film, goes really dark by the end tho.holy shit Danny TRS is working with John Goodman. so freakin cool, whatta badassDon't get me wrong, this trailer has me intrigued, but is this is looks so far removed from the original it's not funny."
"I'm hoping to be proven wrong though.they just released the first trailer 2 months before release??Can anyone tell me what John was saying after he told her not to open the door? For some reason I can't make it out.Its an actual address on Long Island.  Right outside of Queens.Twist: Clover is trying to save the young woman from the clutches of John Goodman, the 'true monster'. It's like Pete's Dragon, but with blood and swears. Holy shit that's actually John Goodman.I guess I need to see Cloverfield.FinallyHonestly, I was not initially excited about this announcement. I thought Cloverfield was alright but wasn't a big fan of all the shaky cam. However, this looks like a much more interesting film that may expand the mythology a bit. It seems to me that it probably takes place after the first movie and that either the monster was not taken down or that more emerged. Either all of New York City, or perhaps even a much larger region, is basically post apocalyptic. Also, it seems that at least the first two acts will take place entirely in the bunker.Cloverfield is a perfect movie."
"This looks super good."
"This is a great day.I'm calling it now, Goodman dies in Act I.Looks like the whole movie will be in the shelter. Hoping for at least 1 quick glance at the monster.I got an itchy picture flippin finger. Come on viral marketing team!When she was running up the stairs to escape she was limping, still have the crutches on I think. interesting. I'm not particularly excited. I'm a bit worried this is going to be one of those movies that takes place entirely on a small set and they don't actually do anything at all. I'm really hoping this entire trailer is more of a teaser, and only the first few minutes of the movie."
"I am going to go rewatch cloverfield, though.> I'm a bit worried this is going to be one of those movies that takes place entirely on a small set"
"I think the end of the teaser signifies that it's going to be more than that. It wouldn't surprise me if this is just the beginning of the movie. Further, the movie is apparently going to be on IMAX, which should give you an indication that we'll see more than just people in a bunker.I wonder if JJ helped to pick the release/film timeline, knowing that a lot of the interest people might have in it would be completely shrouded by the Force Awakens hype. A media blitz for the most anticipated movie in decades would be the perfect time to produce a movie you wanted to keep as secret as possible Thank god they ditched the hand camsNot a sequel but set in the same universe it seemsSo who's gonna start telling me all the secret stuff hidden in this trailer..This really makes me want a Fallout movie. I mean this looks great as well and I will probably watch it, but the whole bunker thing made me wish they were wearing yellow and blue jumpers. Why is John Goodman keeping that girl in a rape dungeon?At first I questioned if we re	lot needed a new Cloverfield movie, or a franchise. I liked the first one, but damn, this looks like it could actually top it.I enjoyed the first one. I remember watching that one girl blow up, and was like o-oGreat teaserI'll have to go back and watch the original. Didnt think much of it at the time other than feeling it was a waste of what could have been a decent monster flick.I don't know. I was pretty disappointed by the first one, I felt it was more hype than substance. This one looks ok but I won't expect too much going into it. Glad to see John Goodman though.Oh man, I feel like I'm going to watch 2 hours of nuclear bunker family drama, and only 20 minutes of glorious monsters. Really hope I'm wrong!According to people who have seen it, it isn't a monster movie."

">>@DrewAtHitFix If it's 'Valencia' with a new title, then it's not Cloverfield 2. Saw a preview a few months ago, and it's big twisty fun.Excited for this."
"But I'm even more excited for the inevitable **Godzilla vs. Cloverfield Monster** movie ~2021.That ending sounds like massive wind build up+something flying by.I don't normally get motion sickness, but Cloverfield put me into a cold sweat from it so I'm glad they're ditching the camera style of that one.Hot damn me and my boyfriend were just talking the other day about how much we loved Cloverfield and wished there was a sequel. Hmmm an overly vague trailer about an overly vague movie"
"Yeah im sure this will be great.Doesn't look like a found footage film. That's good.I personally think we'll get more info about the what/why from this movie than the original. There was never a reason to call it cloverfield, other than the government intro screen referred to the event as the cloverfield incident. Now, if John Goodman is bunkered up on cloverfield lane, I purport that something pivotal goes down right there. Oooooooo I wanna watch this later I was hoping it would be a found footage :("
"But I'm still excited for it.Game of Life! Haven't played that in years!I'd just like to point out the part where the big dude had a bottle smashed in his face and is completely unscathed.The big dude?   You mean John Goodman?  Jesus..  You have to young or not too swift on actors..  Hes been in some big name movies and TV series I know who the actor is, my point is he got smashed in the face with a glass bottle and is completely fine. WTFOh Hell yeah!The trailer was just a bit too long - revealed a bit too much for me JJ is a marketing god.Can someone direct me to where I could find background info on where the monster came from and other info I might have missed in the movie?So, a brand new stand alone story ? The only thing relating it to the first movie is the nameCloverfield ?They should've tried putting out this teaser with no title and just a release date. Would loved to see how that would've goneI wish I had seen this trailer without the knowledge it was a Cloverfield sequel trailer beforehand.  What an awesome feeling that would be seeing CLOVERFIELD at the end.[the entire time in my head watching this...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwYjaAzejuk) Was this filmed a long time ago or has Goodman put on weight again?It's not a sequel and most likely isn't even tied to the story from clover field at all. They described it as a blood relative.There's a play written by Dennis Kelly (who wrote British series Utopia and Pulling) called After the End.  This seems like the exact same plot, but with monsters outside instead of terrorist attacks.  It's one of the darkest plays I had read until I read more by Kelly.  If you like Utopia, check it out!I'm a little late to the party but I'll share my short story for those of you that view the new comments."
"Cloverfield changed my life. For real."
"By no means is it the kind of film you would expect to leave such an effect, but this one has. I think I saw it at a point in my life where I was easily effected by this stuff, as this is not the first film to do this kind of plot. By this I mean kill everyone. Love does not prevail, nor does friendship or wit or skill. They all die helplessly. It put life into perspective for me and I became obsessed with mortality. I guess I never thought about it until I saw this film. I've told my friends but they look at me like I'm crazy. I obviously know it's just a movie but I can pinpoint my obsession with mortality and death to this film."
"I really hope someone makes it out alive in this next one, hopefully that will correct the effect the first one had on me. It's about time.I didn't see the first, but I am really interested in this. Should I take the time to go back and watch the first Cloverfield?Wow. This actually looks very interesting. I'm just happy that they seemed to decide to not jiggle the camera around constantly for the sequel.I found the original film underwhelming, a lot of hype and an average at best movie never goes well for me. I'm not saying Cloverfield was bad as such just it didn't hold well after the hype. This trailer therefore has me cautious. The trailer looks great and that is the problem. I don't want to ride another hype train to mediocrity town. I'm in for John Goodman."
"feelsgoodman.gifmovie might be complete crap, who knows, but the trailer is very well edited.Sorry was a bit pedantic. Your meaning was clear.god dammit god dammit dod fdjsalj fuck yesI'm glad to see Mary Elizabeth Winstead is in this. The last movie I saw her in was the prequel to The Thing and that was awfulI disagree. In fact, one of the reasons I'm excited for her to be in this film was because of that movie, which I loved being a huge fan of the original. I thought she did a fantastic job and I think she shines when it comes to drama type horror scenarios in movies. Wouldn't surprise me if they looked at The Thing when they made the decision to cast her.Not made in the Found footage style that turns my stomach like I'm watching someone's poorly filmed home movie?  I'm in.My god this looks so good. Creepy and it really makes you wanna see what is outside. I hope the main characters make me not root for the monster again.  John Goodman?Oh look, another monster movie where we never see the monster(s), or if we do it's only briefly."
"We already have Signs, and it kind of worked. We don't need another one, and frankly I thought this whole genre had died the quiet and cheap death it deserved.This is so fucking weird. We were just talking about the need for a Cloverfield sequel at work yesterday.I love the way they're going about this whole thing. Not only did they film a movie without anyone knowing about it, but they're still trying to keep us guessing with the trailer. This *looks* like a claustrophobic character drama, but I'm betting the bunker stuff is right at the beginning (or rather, a somewhat small portion of the film, wherever it lands); the fact that this is a Cloverfield sequel, is being released in IMAX, and has a budget of $100 million (4 times that of the original) leads me to believe this is still going to have some awesome kaiju-esque goodness.John Goodman is my Schrodinger's cat. I'm never 100% certain if he is alive or dead. Its only when he comes out in a movie, that I'm sure he is not dead.I've been waiting for this day since my balls were still deep inside my body, I can't express how much I needed this day in my life.looks really good to me. I don't feel like much was spoiled in the trailer. Love the music selection in it.whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!"
"now i'm just wondering what she saw I'M HYPEDPlot twist, it turns out that they are the real monsters....Apparently it's not meant to be a direct sequel.I hope the movie will be a mockumentary, when she ho out, like the first movie. That'd be awesome.On top of being a great trailer, I'm super hype cause I always felt Cloverfield would benefit from having a sequel. The first one basically set up a universe with potential I thought was going to go to waste if they just kept it a once off film. Now they're going to expand on and enrich the first movie which was great but left a lot of questions and didn't have a lot of backstory. I love me some Mary Elizabeth Winstead too, probably one of my all time favorites just for being involved in so many movies and franchises I'm a fan of and killing it in anything she does. Also John Goodman in the mix? AND it comes out in two months? Couldn't be more down.I feel strong Take Shelter vibes out of this trailer. Family paranoid drama with monsters in background. Movie's shot in IMAX. I don't think a movie entirely set in an underground bunker would be filmed that way. I expect the bunker to be only half the movie. JJ always has been secretive with his trailers. Looks good, but don't watch the trailer, it's spoiler city. They show way too much.I was honestly kinda disappointed by Cloverfield. An exercise in movie marketing."
"Judging by the 'zomg best trailer evar' comments here it seems like pretty much the same thing.You had me at JJ.A couple friends and I were just talking about how I hated Cloverfield and couldn't stop complaining the entire movie."
"But this looks good John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead? I'm in.Imagine being abducted by John Goodman, gross.This isn't a sequel to Cloverfield. It's related in theme only (mystery box movies). I'm not expecting any monsters. It's just marketing. Nobody cared when it was called Valencia.That's a terrible nameNo idea what is going on at allI am literally way too hyped. This is a great way to start my friday.No that is how you do a trailer!!!!Man, this looks so good.  A coworker of mine said something like, I hope the whole movie isn't in the bunker, and when she goes up to that door the movie ends.  He's planted an ugly seed of doubt in my mind."
"Still, no shakey cam, John Goodman, unspoilery trailer..  I'm on board.CLOVERFIELD SEQUEL COMING OUT OF NOWHERE. WATCHING CLOVERFIELD EVERY DAY UNTIL THIS COMES OUT. EXCITEMENT DOESN'T EVEN COME CLOSE TO MY EMOTIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!Relax, there wont be a giant monster."

"Waking up from a car accident, a young woman finds herself in the basement of a man who says he's saved her life from a chemical attack that has left the outside uninhabitable."
"spoiler guess: The monsters were in the bunker with her all along in the form of goodman and there was no real threat outside. Can see it coming 10 miles away.For a second I thought I was watching LOST season 2I was interested until i saw Matt Reeves (Director) and Drew Goddard (Writer) were not involved.Sounds like Shelter."
"Don't watch it, trust me, save your two hours of life.Wait...why?I think I just peed a little."
"Now THATS a fucking trailerGreat trailer. Love John Goodman.Can somebody please re-cut this with the Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt theme song?No rating and new director. Risky business. Looks dope though.I'm still confused as to how it's related to the first one...So when was this filmed? The last I heard John Goodman had lost an incredible amount of weight and was healthy?I'm so psyched for this.  I loved Cloverfield.  This looks very different, but I'm totally on board.  MEW and John Goodman?  Hell yeah. And this trailer was excellent. Not a sequel more of a spiritual successor. Still really cool though I hope this trailer doesnt spoil the whole movie."
"SPOILERS"
"I hope she doesnt escape near the end and then we get a glimpse of the monster and the movie ends... I would be SO MAD!What monster? This isn't a sequel to Cloverfield, and there's probably no monster.Bottle movie?Easy way this connects to the first:"
"*Hammerdown*Meh...And now I must avoid all other promotional material lest the whole fucking thing gets ruined.Now that is how you tease a movie. Thank you for not putting all the meat in the trailer.Screenshots of MEW are already posted in http://www.wikifeet.com/Mary_Elizabeth_Winstead @.@Guys, per IMDB, the budget is $5Million. That barely pays for John Goodman's salary, let alone all the monsters FX of the first one...Dan becomes a man.Maybe a Mod can alter the title of this post to make it less misleading?Hopefully this one is not filmed in Nausea-O-Rama.I hope it turns out good, just keep in mind it's not the same people who did the original cloverfield movie (writer or director)...She looks outside and nothing has happened.  We already cancelled the Apocalypse... Robin Sparkles. Is that you?"
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6Q3mHyzn78Jim Harper!I'm sure it'll be just like the first Cloverfield movie.hope they splurged on a steady cam this time.Isnt it weird how their bunker has a door? shouldnt it be a hatch. If there really is that much chaos and destruction going on outside then whatever structure that is holding their door up wouldve been destroyed. Will it have shaky cam stuff? Cuz that shit is what threw me off of the first one.Nope. Its a more traditional film.Wow, this looks a ton like the initial premise to 'Hidden'. This is such a great trailer, and the movie will probably be fantastic.  But JJ has only referred to it as being a 'blood relative' of the 2008 film, which I'm guessing means same universe rather than sequel.  So I doubt this is Cloverfield 2. I reckon almost all of this film is going to be set in the basement, and we'll probably only get to see the outside world (and maybe a glimpse of a monster) in the last act."
"I'm fine with that - I'd have seen the movie after seeing this trailer without there being any mention of Cloverfield, and I have no problem with Bad Robot making movies vaguely in the Cloverfield universe which have little connection to the original film.  But attaching the name Cloverfield to the movie might mean it's facing hype it can never live up to - I'm not sure it'll survive the backlash if people are expecting a more direct sequel and then this is something completely different.  I hope it does well, though - looks like a great thriller with an amazing cast.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2131532/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_4I want to see absolutely nothing else of this movie.Anybody know the name of the song in this trailer?You can see what looks like [two buildings](http://i.imgur.com/LNJiGsQ.png?1) through the window.there are spoilers about this being tied to the cellar and this is a money grab. i don't know what to believe anymore.Why does it say JJ Abrams? What part did he play in the film?So John Goodman & Co. Didn't even know they were in a Cloverfield movie while shooting? I'm sorry but if after waiting 7 years, the sequel we waited for turns out to be a physiological thriller all set in a bunker with the ending being she escapes and either sees/gets killed by the monster I am going to be very disappointed."
"It's a teaser trailer. My theory is that these characters might not even appear in the movie."
"I remember my Cloverfield DVD. Abrams on commentary saying Cloverfield is a great way to tell different peoples' stories about the same event."
"George Romero style.I hope they finally get to the cloverfield in this one."
"Sorry If I spoiled anything for people who haven't seen the first one yet.JJ is the keeper of spoilers and leaks! Such a Sly one to keep this much anticipated sequel under the Star Wars rug so long. Can't wait! This already changes the top 10 anticipated...yeah this looks like it will have no entertainment value to people that liked CloverfieldI enjoyed cloverfield and this movie has peaked my interestLoving this take on a sequel for the franchise! Seems very close quarters and personal. I think its gonna be really good, Bad Robot has a great track record imo. Im excited."
"Also March 11th holy shit - so close.I love me a good psychological thriller, I hope this is a solid single location movieInteresting how the creature in the first film was only a baby...I saw Cloverfield at 12am on opening day.  First time I ever did that for a movie.   I don't care how good this trailer is.  I'm giving it two weeks. Did anyone else get nauseous watching the first one?I am hoping this movie is not shaky cam the whole time.  It made my buddy throw up when we saw it at the theater."
"Also if anybody has Rebar run through them and then can run just fine a few minutes later, I'm out. This trailer is totally rad JJ is like the Ryan Secrest of directing and producingThe Tiffany cover song is kinda weird.You do know Tiffany covered it first, right?Oh, I completely forgot about that. I never heard the original before but now that you mention it I recall reading somewhere at the time (in the 80s) that it's a cover song. Thanks for the reminder!AWE FUCKING YISS I'VE BEEN WAITING YEARS FOR THIS Had no idea Cloverfield is apparently among Reddit's favorite movies. I recall it being slaughtered by critics and it's the only movie that's ever made me bored and nauseous at the same time. But hey, to each their own.http://puu.sh/mwKkM/3378652ab2.png"
"Slaughtered? I don't consider certified fresh slaughtered, but hey, to each their own. There are a lot of haters in this thread. They always come out when people are happy. Am I the only one who hated Cloverfield?She escapes, goes to New York, and finds the video camera they used to record the events of the first movie."
"Stoked for this!  I loved the first movie. The first scared me so bad as a kid. I've been rewatching Scott Pilgrim these past few weeks. I'm ready to see Ramona come into Cloverfield  <3One thing actually makes me excited for the film: It is not found footage.So...season 2 of Lost? This looks really great. When Cloverfield came out, I wanted to like it so much. But I went to see it in theaters and thought I was going to throw up. The found footage shaky cam was just too much for me to handle. Cloverfield was a crock of shit. I suspect the sequel will be too.The first one sucked. I have no expectations of this one.[Tiffany - I Think We're Alone Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6Q3mHyzn78)someone says they saw the original screening VALENCIA which is renamed 10 cloverfield lane. on twitter he states its not a cloverfield sequel and has nothing to do with it, but says its big twisty funThe production company added some scenes to tie-in to the Cloverfield movie"
"Yeah, patheticI could fucking cry right now. But why? Cloverfield was shit, I mean horrible horrible shitGoddammit, more fucking lens flares.This is gonna sound weird, but don't you think they showed just a little bit too much? I mean, it's not like they spoiled the entire movie, but now we all know going into it that the girl will betray them and try to run away. Maybe that's just a very minor thing that happens at the very beginning, but if we were supposed to be on the edge of our seats wondering if someone was gonna break, then that's all gone now.IMO if the feeling of JJ Abrams' trailers were also put into his movies they would be so awesome. Just about every trailer has me so fucking pumped to see his movies... and then I see his movies."
"* **Coverfield** - Trailer? *Interesting. Thought-provoking*. Movie? Alright."
"* **Star Trek 2009** - Trailer? *Awesome. Very exciting*. Movie? Good."
"* **Super 8** - Trailer? *Great*. Movie? Boring."
"* **Star Trek v2 Darkness** - Trailer? *Holy shit AWESOME*. Movie? Alright."
"* **Star Wars TFA** - Trailer? *Tears from sheer joy and excitement*. Movie? Disney-type fun adventure."
"Overall I think JJ Abrams has screenwriting issues. He makes fun flashy movies that lack any everlasting substance or depth. Prime example: Poe Dameron was by far the most interesting character in The Force Awakens. We got like, what, 3 scenes with him? I was pretty disappointed. I hope this new Cloverfield movie won't suffer from the same screenwriting mistakes."
"The last two Mission Impossible movies were good. Thank god they ditched that horrid found footage format. I might actually be able to enjoy this one. I had a hard time sitting through the first one and frankly didn't care for it because of that shitty style that seemed so pervasive at the time. I'm glad the number of found footage films is dwindling. I've never found it immersive or realistic, just distracting and annoying with too many useless scenes and inane babble.so sick and fucking tired of the found footage crap. ruins every movie it's used in, doesn't give any real life feeling to anything, gives people headaches."
"reading that hollywood? knock it off.Would be kind of cool if it didn't say Cloverfield sequel in the title. I starting out thinking it was a rom com. Then my jaw dropped when I realised it was Cloverfield!they should have advertised as a sequel to Room, then hold up with the theme for the first half hour until the character escapes into freedom - meaning wasteland. From there it would be The Road set in a Fallout style world."
"still very interesting theme for a sequel, not just a revisited version of the first one like most sequelsSeems predictable.... I mean, there are only so many ways that can go. Either they stay in for the entire movie because they have to due to toxic air or something or because there are monsters out there. And either one of them escapes or they don't. Its just honestly so predictable when a movie either mostly or entirely takes place in one or two locations. I don't think..."
"I mean, rather, this is a teaser and the movie as a whole has little to nothing to do with these people. Maybe the movie's real protagonist will run past the shelter and see them in the window or something.Why can't I find it on IMDB?http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1179933/I hope this is actually an Avengers tie in.  Totally normal move for 85 minutes and in the final 5 Thor and Iron Man show up to take down the baby and the mom then arrives and the movie cuts to black and plugs Civil War.They just put a camera in the tumble dryer with five barbies and a toy godzilla."
"It's still good though.Double plot twist: JJ is secretly M.Night and there is no connection Cloverfield except the street name and after the death and destruction in the bunker, the female lead emerges the bunker as the sole survivor into the post-apocalyptia of Fallout. I really didn't like the first one. Hated the shakey-cam shit and never really found the monster to be that scary because you never saw it."
"That being said, this actually looks like it could shape up to be a much better movie. As long as they don't spend all damn movie in that bunker and actually go out in the world around it for more than 20 mins I'd be pretty pumped. It's probably the case, bunker for atleast  3/4 of film[deleted]I don't think Super 8 tied into Cloverfield at all save from the 'Slusho' reference iirc[deleted]No I don't think there's any It's the same monster! truth to that. While they both do appear to have multiple limbs, that's about where the similarities end. The Cloverfield monster is many times larger and dumber than the seemingly highly intelligent alien in Super 8. Besides, Super 8 takes place in the past which supports the prequel idea, I really don't think that was the intention. I thought Super 8 was like a more modern ET. Bunch of kids discover alien that government hid and help send it home.Super 8 was an homage to Spielbergian movies of the 80s like ET and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. And it had absolutely nothing to do with Cloverfield.After a car accident, a young woman comes to in an underground cellar, where most of the action takes place. She fears she has been abducted by a survivalist, who tells her he saved her life and that a chemical attack has left the outside world uninhabitable. Uncertain what to believe, she decides she must escape, whatever dangers she may face outside.The attempted escape implies she feels like a hostage, and the shock at the end, further implies she didn't know about the monsters. The overall implication is that Goodman's character is potentially exploiting the situation, or they've been down there since before the alien invasion, possibly on the back of a story of nuclear war, etc...(you wake up in a shelter, and goodman convinces you he saved you from nuclear fallout/zombies/barbra streisand/the rat race etc"
"Much of the story may be, and appears to be the interplay of the characters before finding out about the monsters. So, it's very possible she doesn't believe Goodman, tries to escape, realises the truth, and then there is further tension based on her attempted escape and betrayal of trust; maybe Goodman is equally surprised, having convinced her/them it was some other disaster they were hiding from... Then, of course, they still want out, potentially from curiosity, or maybe something forces them; a fire, or Goodman going crazy, possibly after feeling cornered or threatened by their mistrust, and ultimately they're forced into the alien filled wasteland to fend for themselves.Everybody bitched about Cloverfield when it was released and now it's a horror classic, nice.Colverfield sucked and was like a way worse pacific rim.You can't even compare the two, both were fantastic in there own rightI agree.Theres no monster guys. The movie takes place in the aftermath of cloverfield where chemicals used to kill the monster have rendered the outside uninhabitable. Its a movie about human nature and shit, not monsters. Look at the tagline, monsters come in many forms, that may as well say there will be no real monster here.You've seen it? Or you've read the script? You seem to know more than anyone else on the internet.Just a prediction based on what we already know. But yes it does seem that way sometimes.Considering that it's NOT a sequel, it would be very surprising if it took place in the aftermath of Cloverfield, don't you think?True, a sequel but people are expecting Oh no the monster is back! and I dont think it will be that.But the theme of people being monsters can be a good one [when done right.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monsters_Are_Due_on_Maple_Street)Reaaally hoping they continue with Cloverfield, amd at one point we get a Godzilla vs Cloverfield movie. This generation needs some good giant monster movies!If this turns out to be J.J fucking with us for our money again I will never see another movie with his name attached again. Always goes with the secretive advertising just to not spoil the lack of pretty much anything interesting going on at all.Prepare for some disappointment. This movie was previously titled Valencia. It has screened a few times and is not a sequel nor a spinoff of Cloverfield. The name change came about as a piece of genius marketing. JJ referred to it as a relative of Cloverfield, as it is very similar in tone, style, and setting.Cloverfield was also previously titled Cheese... It happens.I realize that title changes happen. But people have already seen this movie.But if its allegedly gone through changes, we can't be certain it will be the same film those people watched, so I just figured all of this shouldn't be taken to heart.So what does this have to do with 13 Hours?The trailer was attached to the film."
"Apple loses Slide to Unlock patent in a lawcase at the German Supreme CourtGermany getting it right.I find that Germany's usually on the sensible side of things. apart from that one timecome one we are allowed some small mistakes as well There are, naturally, some exceptions to that. Those include the lack of marriage equality, some aspects of the otherwise accomplished school system (mainly that the pupils have to specialize into a field at a very early age), lots of low-paid part time scam jobs, and redundant bureaucracy in a lot of societal services.> lack of marriage equality"
"Maybe because thats the opposite of the sensible side of things."
"Marriage is a privilege, granted to heterosexual couples, and this is the way it has always been meant to be and as that it makes sense. There is no point at all in publicly supporting private hobbies like homosexuality."
"always been meant to be - any proof for that? Marriage is a human social concept, and thus it can be adapted to modern social humans."
"Homosexuality is as much a hobby as heterosexuality. And before you bring up the but they can't have children point, infertile heterosexuals can't either.But they can have children. "
"Your argument doesnt invalidate this point at all because in most cases you dont know of the infertility beforehand. I personally know several people who had been diagnosed as infertile, yet later they had children of their own."
"And even if your point was valid, there would still be no reason to grant special privileges to homosexuals. It would be a reason to deprive infertile couples of these privileges."
"Okay, let me rephrase that: do you think that infertile people who knew beforehand and will definitely not have children (because of removed parts of the womb or whatever other scenario you can think of) should be disallowed to marry? If your answer is no, then you have to admit that having children is not the sole purpose of marriage, which means this argument can't be used against granting homosexuals equal rights in this regard."
"And it's not special privilege. You might not have noticed, but the western world agrees that marriage is not solely for children - it is simply a bond between two people, and for that, their gender is completely irrelevant. Marriage is a human concept. It can be adapted by humans. It doesn't have to stay the exact same, and it hasn't. Why would 2 people who just want to live together need special public support?"
"Its the raising of children and the stability of a family thats the hard thing to deal with for young couples. Also, marriage was always meant to create a special bond, create a high threshold before divorce, to give the children the couple creates more life security. "
"None of that qualifies for homosexual couples or heterosexual couples who dont plan to live together to become a family."
"It doesnt even make sense that homosexuals want to be married in the first place. I think its just a childish me too cry, and maybe a political move to make those opposed to this demand somehow look evil. They just wanna have, too, what those guys have. Nanny-state problems."
"You didn't answer my question. Should definitely infertile people be banned from marrying?"
"The state encourages two-person relationships through marriage not just for the benefit of potential children, but to encourage the bond itself. Two people living together means less bureaucracy and a better tax situation. The state wants to encourage that. It's not simply because they might have children. "
"What, it does not make sense that people want to have the same rights as anyone else? Again, heterosexuals can marry and then proceed to never have children, and the state does not punish that. Why should that not be allowed for homosexuals? Not to mention that there is still adoption as a way for any couple to raise a child. "
"EDIT: Also, if you think this is a nanny-state problem, why not abolish all state-benefits for marriage? That would end any involvement of the state into the institution of marriage.> You didn't answer my question. Should definitely infertile people be banned from marrying?"
"Of course. Its purely academic though because those cases are very rare. "
"> The state encourages two-person relationships through marriage not just for the benefit of potential children, but to encourage the bond itself. Two people living together means less bureaucracy and a better tax situation. The state wants to encourage that. It's not simply because they might have children."
"Good points. A first in many of this kind of discussion. "
"private hobbies like homosexuality"
"*I like skiing, watercolors, and fucking dudes.*"
"Yes, that's totally what homosexuality is, a hobby..."
"Keep your definition within your religion, and let society choose a definition that leads to greater stability and happiness for its members.> Those include the lack of marriage equality"
"Only inequality left is the name and that gay couples have to adopt serially, but can't jointly. The latter thing is a legal detail arising from the way the current law was made (by decision of the constitutional court, they never sweep broadly but only address the matter at hand) the former... meh."
"Expect the whole thing to change as soon as we get rid of the conservative government."
"> some aspects of the otherwise accomplished school system"
"Schooling is a state matter. Many states are actually fixing it... and no, Bavaria isn't Germany."
"> lots of low-paid part time scam jobs"
"Well, our welfare system got its name from a [convicted criminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Hartz)."
">  and redundant bureaucracy in a lot of societal services."
"Not so much redundant as bizarre, a lot of that has to do with different levels being responsible for different things at different times, and untangling that mess (e.g. if you're on ALGII you get welfare from the federation, but the municipality pays your rent)."
"And the BA is especially bad, you can be glad if they actually apply the laws at hand and not interpret them as they bloody please. > lots of low-paid part time scam jobs"
"Cutco? > ... lack of marriage equality ..."
"Well you have to blame the CDU (Christian Democratic Union) for that. But to be honest I am fine with that, they don't change it for easy popularity and stay true to their ideology.Their school system sounds better than America's everyone go to college, get a liberal arts degree, now complain you don't have a good job to pay back your loans At least they're students, from what you implied, are trained for something productive. Plus, going to university doesn't put you in debt.Which is offset by higher taxes. I dunno, is it? Student debt in the US seems pretty crippling from what I've read about it.Only by people who shouldn't have gone to college to begin with. Government trying to ensure everyone a college education and this 6 figure American dream life is the issue. Some people don't have the drive and motivation but they're told they can have it. They go to college for a bull shit degree and get stuck with debt, rather than just learning a trade and making a solid 50k/year. But isn't the cost of a degree high across the board?In nominal terms yea. But in real value no. Not to forget censorship + GEMA> Not to forget censorship "
"There is no censorship. It's just that companies have to censor themselves to remain in the market. The Prufstelle fur jugendgefahrdende Medien checks media (films, books, games, ...) and marks certain media as not being suitable for everyone under 18. If that happens, you are not allowed to advertise them, which makes it nearly impossible to sell them - including making online sale impossible. Therefore, everyone censors their media to not fall into that category, which leads to the impression that there is censorship in Germany."
"Youth protection in Germany is out of hand and completely broken.Uhm not really. You can advertise them. Many games such as GTA 5 are Rates AS 18+, but still advertised. There is something else like extreme violence (Gore like) vor showing banned stuff (mainly swastikas) gets censored and them games you buy in germany are altered, such as swastikas in Wolfenstein are replaced. In movies swastikas are allowed however, cause movies are considered Art, Video games are not. "
"Gore is censored more  in germany, but nudity is censored less. "
"Another thing is indexed media. This can't be advertised or shown open in stores. But it is legal to sell to people over 18, just have to know about it and find a seller.Calling an immense pressure to self-censor not censorship is only technically correct, though. Actually, it's even worse for companies, since with videogames, altering content for individual markets is costly - the state *can't* censor it because of the nature of videogames, but they force companies to spend their own money to do it.There is no such pressure.There is no such pressure - is this a joke?"
"The state says either you censor that (at your own cost), or we will bar you from any and all advertising and your product will only be sold under the table, it will not be displayed in the store and that's supposed to be no such pressure?"
"For many products, that is a death sentence. Well, then you shouldn't make such a product.So you think it is absolutely fair to restrict some artforms and not others? To make it legal for movies to display Swastikas, but not for videogames? To ban materials, not because of any actual danger they provide, not because they contain recipes for homemade bombs, but simply because the state judges the inhabitants to be too fragile to cope with it? "
"We have a 18+ rating. Why not slap that unto these works? "
"Do you actually have a point, or do you just want to be contrarian?They don't really force it; it's entirely voluntary on the part of the companies."
"If they want to sell in Germany, they have to comply with German norms and laws, yes. But it's not like they're forced to sell in the German market. That's entirely their choice.As I said, calling an immense pressure to self-censor not censorship is only true by the letter and not by the spirit."
"My point is that this law is pointless, archaic and unfairly targets some artforms over others.But there is no pressure to sell in Germany; therefore there is no pressure to self-censor. It's all voluntarily."
"I don't disagree with you, but it's important to point out the difference. Censorship is illegal in the constitution, while applying this kind economic of pressure isn't.Yeah, damn! If only i were allowed to buy KZ-Manager! Censorship? You mean, having to be 18 to buy ultra-violent media?"
"[deleted]/r/watchpeopledie is blocked here."
"...I don't see the downside. And confiscating my swastika trunks :("
"Yeah, if it isn't banned altogether.Can you give some examples of media that were banned altogether, as opposed to having their display and sale restricted to adults?The Wolfenstein franchise for it's depiction of Nazis, Carmageddon because of gore, Mortal Kombat...again, gore."
"http://www.blood-is-red.de/mw/index.php/Liste_indizierter_Spiele"
"these are games on the Index"
"index [B] is for games that are verboten from sale. you are allowed to own it, but it is illegal to sell or display them publicly, and the german customs may confiscate it if you try to import them"
"it's technically not banned altogether, but effectively it isCool. Assuming that site is accurate, that's finally some concrete info on the games that are still on sale and the few which aren't."
"For example:"
"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kategorie:Indiziertes_Computerspiel"
"For some of those games a censored version was created to get approved in germany. Others like Manhunt are banned altogether."
"Okay, so we're talking about all of 18 games that were actually prohibited from being sold, according to this:"
"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kategorie:Beschlagnahmtes_Computerspiel"
"All the other games can still be sold. You can walk into a shop and pick them up.And that's still censorship. How many do they have to ban so that you acknowledge it? "
"And yeah, you *can* go and get them. But they aren't allowed to be advertised or shown in the store, meaning it's unlikely you know what to ask for to get it (although that has become less of a problem due to the internet and general bi-lingual capabilities by the new generation). "
"It used to be so harsh that those games couldn't even be *reviewed* - I remember vividly that an outlet reviewed Return to Castle Wolfenstein under the name Back to Castle Dogrock or something like that.The complete list is not public, but you can send a request to the bpjm to ask if a certain title is on the list, which means it is impossible to know the complete list (except you ask A LOT)."
"Except of those 18 games, there are probably a lot more games, films, music and other types of media on this list.Manhunt was shit so they were just saving you time and money. that's what my friend said, too"
"even an edgy little 14 year old like him was bored by itI see you are not a fan of computer games, not a recreational gamer.    "
"[Just Ctrl+f german and read up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regionally_censored_video_games)"
"A significant number of games aren't mentioned because red blood had to be replaced with green goo, etc.There's only a single game mentioned as being banned on that site, and according to its Wiki entry:"
"Therefore, sale to minors and marketing the original version of the game were prohibited throughout the Federal Republic of Germany."
"So, no, the game isn't an example of media being outright banned.Weird. At least Manhunt, Silent Hill:Homecoming, Dead Rising, should not be available in Germany. Probably some technicality, that means they're not outright banned, but are prohibited from distribution..."
"And all the german altered versions."
"It's not as simple as ultra violence for under-18."
"Edit: nice downvotes. Not only is my post contributing to the discussion, but is in fact absolutely correctTo be fair some things are actually banned, not just on the Index.No, more the whole List B, where media is isn't allowed to be advertised or sold directly over the counter if it is on the list. This *kills* the product, thus the company *has* to either censor it to their liking or completely leave out the German market. "
"This has been a problem especially for videogames, which are still not acknowledged as art by the government, meaning that while movies are absolutely allowed to show, for example, a Hakenkreuz, a game that does this is immediately switched to List B.>mainly that the pupils have to specialize into a field at a very early age"
"Well fields is a bit of an overstatement here. There are three tiers of school. The upper you take if you want to go to university, the middle if you want to learn a trade and the lower if you want to be without a job for the rest of your life. (that last one relatively recent development though)"
"But it's not like you can't move up after you are done with school. After I was done with the middle tier I did an additional two years of school, got the degree that makes it possible to go to university, which I then did."
"Still our school system leaves a lot to be desired, I agree."
">redundant bureaucracy in a lot of societal services"
"Do you have any specifics? Haven't really seen any redundancies anywhere.The lack of marriage equality is pretty shameful, though. It amazes me that we're so far behind on that. Thanks, CDU!I used to think Lebenspartnerschaft would give pretty much the same rights and it was just a name thing ... But apparently, it doesn't protect one of the partners from being expelled from the country after their visa runs out. WTF?And I think it takes some steam out of getting proper marriage equality because it makes some people think that the current state is already good enough... Well I think it's just a question of time, but how much time is the question.> redundant bureaucracy in a lot of societal services"
"well for me the Familienkasse sends 2 letters every month, at the beginning and end, always asking the same questions regarding my studying at university. You would think they got the message that I am still studying and will be for the next couple of years after answering nearly 20 letters over half a year...This school system is also mostly the one we use in Holland, you are placed on a certain level of school which usually exist out of five different ones,  but you can also move up and down depending on your performanceit's the same in germany"
"after primary school, you usually get 2 years of probation to see if you're in the right school and get placed up or down accordingly"
"and after 10th grade of the middle tier school, you can go on to the top tier if you so chooseFirst Walmart, now this. Plus they don't have speed limits on autobahns. I'm almost ready to pack by bags. tldr; driving on the no-speedlimit autobahn in Germany is extremely stressfull."
"No speedlimits on the autobahn is a negative for me. I have been driving thourgh Germany many times. On the autobahn its incredibly stressfull to drive. Big trucks still have a speedlimit of 90/100 km/h and you naturally wanna go past them since you are normally cruising around 120 km/h. But if you wanna go past you have to be extremely cautious before you switch lanes since there are people coming in 200 km/h just swooping past you. Once I cross the border into Denmark or the Netherlands it is so much nicer because everyone is driving about the same speed.It's not stressful at all. The slow driving busses and lorrys drive on the right while the really fast cars drive on the left. If you don't want to go that fast but still overtake the slow vehicles just drive in the middle.> Big trucks still have a speedlimit of 90/100 km/h"
"It's 80km/h! Some buses have an exception for 100km/h, but other than that, everything heavier than 7.5t has an 80km/h speed limit.Yeah.... Germany has plenty of big box stores like Walmart already. Depends where. Most of the roads can and do have speed limits. And basically anywhere they *can* institute a speed limit at times if traffic/weather/etc necessitate it."
"Made the drive from the northwest of Germany to The southeast not too long ago and there were speed limits for 80% of it. Also lots and lots of traffic.As someone who just moved to Sweden and rarely shopped at Walmart in The States, I miss that place so much. It's nice when there's a couple things you need and you have no clue which little store sells themDude. Tall blondes with blue eyes who love to drink. At first you're like OMG OMG OMG then you're like I wanna go home, my head hurts.I was born in Russia and preparedWhat happened with walmart in Germany? [This is not America.

"tl;dr: highly competitive food discounters (aldi, lidl, etc), bad press, german laws and german cultureWatch out for the censorship of any gore, the $1500 drivers licenses and the fact that all grocery stores have to be closed on sunday by law.1500?"
"I wish that would be it. On the other hand: a lot less censorship of nudity, nice cars and fast highways, and less people who have to work Sundays, because all the grocery stores have to be closed by law!nice cars but cost of operating them (tax and fuel) is more than double of that of the US.Also carbon emission tax at ~$1000 US per liter (over 1 liter) per year.Very true. Higher operating cost, much stricter vehicle inspections, stricter and more expensive drivers licences."
"On the other hand: good public transportation, fairly affordable and reliable for commuting, and pretty good options in terms of cost and availability to go on trips throughout Europe without even owning a car!Honestly, no matter how good public transportation is, it is still always utter shit compared to owning a car. I speak first hand experience from living in europe.Also speaking from first hand experience: I really like living in places where it's possible to *not* own a car. Both in the US and in Europe."
"It's pretty great to have grocery stores, bars, restaurants, farmers markets, public swimming pools, parks, sports venues, movie theaters, etc. all in walking distance, or easily reachable via public transportation. It's pretty great *not* having to drive around for 20 minutes every day looking for a parking spot in the city. It's pretty great living in a place that is built around pedestrians and bicyclists, not around car and trucks. It's pretty great *not* getting stuck in rush hour every day. It's pretty great being able to go out with friends, have a couple of drinks and not worry about who has to be the designated driver this time."
"Don't get me wrong, I like having a car, I like road trips, and I like driving. As long as it's an option I have, and not a daily nuisance that I have to endure.> It's pretty great to have grocery stores, bars, restaurants, farmers markets, public swimming pools, parks, sports venues, movie theaters, etc. all in walking distance, or easily reachable via public transportation"
"Yeah, that is great (I currently live in a place like that in england) but then comes the time you gotta buy a fucking TV or some office chair and then you're utterly fucked carrying the damn thing the whole distance. And then there's craigslist/gumtree. Haha you wanna buy a nice cheap TV or fridge from there without a car? NOT HAPPENINGI know. Always sucks. You're pretty happy with your daily life, have everything you need on a daily basis around you without having to bother with maintaining a car, paying taxes and insurance, refilling wiper fluid, changing oil, rotating tires, or paying through your nose just for a new battery... and then you want to go on a weekend camping trip, and it's just completely impossible because there's no way of getting to that particular place without a car!"
"I've used Zipcar in the past, and those are pretty great where they exist. If they existed in more places, were always available and only required a 5 minute walk to pick them up, I think I'd live happily without ever owning a car.There isn't a speed limit per se, but there definitely is a suggested speed you can go."
"I *think* if you go faster than that and something bad happens it's considered entirely (edit: partially) your fault. "
"Plus, it's a highway. A busy place, depending. "
"You're not necessarily going to be able to bring out your sports car and let it gallop.Actually, you can exactly do that. Sure, a lot of sections of the Autobahn do have a speed limit, but it's not unusual at all for people to go 200+ km/h on the unrestricted portions.Last time I visited Germany I had no troubles going as fast as my rental could (~125mph) and being overtake by much faster traveling Audi/BMW/Mercedes. German here. There are speed limits on about 50% of the Autobahn, ranging from ~~80~~ 60 km/h in construction sites to 130 km/h. When there is no limit, the *recommended* speed is 130 km/h. "
"Some political parties want a general speed limit of 130 but the more traditional, conservative parties don't want that. "
"EDIT: Some construction sites require you to slow down to 60 km/h. Might want to read up on a few things. Like GEMA blocking almost half of YouTube it feels and overall censorship of games and stuff. And shameless redditors with their lame Nazi jokes in this day and age.So you guys were nazis right? Is not a very good small talk topic.so you guys were slave owners?Were? I'm a parent.Yes! You weren't? I had all the action figures as a kid, Goebbels, Goring, Mengele with a detachable syringe ...Man, I hate what the cartoon did to Rommel. Just because they *called* him The Desert Fox, didn't mean he had to be demoted to cute animal sidekick.I liked Rommel because he came with a tank and cyanide capsules.Yup. Apple is slowly losing multiple of their patents - the rounded corners one only happened a few days ago."
"In this one, it's interesting because under German law patents are not valid if they do not solve an existing problem in a new, innovative way. And this did not even solve a problem, really - it was not a creative solution, it was essentially do what a door bolt does on a computer. No creativity, so invalid. Additionally, they found prior art - from a 2004 Windows Mobile device.> Yup. Apple is slowly losing multiple of their patents - the rounded corners one only happened a few days ago."
"I thought rounded corners was a [design patent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_patent), not a *[utility patent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent)*."
"Design patents (as they are called in the USA) are more like a cross between a trademark and a copyright than a utility patent with the caveat that design patents last far less time than present day copyrights (and trademarks)."
"I'm sorry but it so easy to sit in your armchair and tip the fedora here. Please tell me how sliding your finger accross the screen is not innovative in order to unlock a digital device? Most would have used a PIN. The reality is, for a capacitive screen, a spring loaded swipe switch that doesn't unlock until you reach the end is brilliant. All of these 15 year old engineers and patent gurus on here are driving me nuts. I hope you come up with a great idea one day and someone steals it from you. If Apples idea was so craptacular, why not just make a better one?Apples idea was not crap, but the issue is that it's not patentable if very similar ideas exist before."
"Other companies had swipe to unlock, Apple was only the first to say you can only unlock by swiping in one specific direction."
"That's not creative enough for a patent.>2004 Windows Mobile device?"
"People ask me why I beat up on karma whores and serial reposters, but when the OP actually CARES about the information they are sharing, and can answer questions/have a dialog about the topic, reddit is SO much better off. "
"I think we need to recognize this more so that people realize why karma whores are completely unnecessary and a welt on the ass of reddit.That's why I only post about topics where I know what it's about and am interested in it, too."
"In this case, the success came quite surprising. (As you can see, although my account is over a year old, almost all my karma is from this post xD)"
"But you're right, it's better to be able to have an OP who understands the topic and can discuss it (because that means the title is also less misleading) than to have someone that just reposts like a robot.Yep.

"What device was that?Wait, they're still on the rounded corner thing? I thought that was a while ago lmao. I was wondering why my Sony Smart Watch got an update a few days ago which changed the view to have rounded corners, whereas the screen is square.[deleted]> No creativity, so invalid."
"No much wow.As a designer, just because it seems obvious after you've seen it does not mean it's not creative. Often, quite the opposite.How is it not creative  if the entire handheld market followed suit?Because swipe to unlock existed before. Where you would swipe a displayed box into any direction and it would unlock."
"Slide to Unlock only limits this to one direction."
"Saying the same as XYZ, but one dimensional is not very creative or patentable.In defense of the rounded corners patent, it's a design patent in the US which is, by definition, closer to a trademark than an invention/innovation patent. Design patents are, again by definition, nonfunctional, ornamental design choices on a functional thing. Similar, and also protected, design patents include the coke bottle shape. Design patents are much more limited than trademarks, in their need to be very specific (such as radius compared to height and width) and they have expiry dates. Also, as stated, they need to be on a functional item, like a phone."
"It's still arguable whether it's patentable as a design patent, but the whole thing is immensely less ridiculous than what most people think of at the word patent as a new innovation or invention. Rounded corners were by no means completely novel. but before the iPhone or iPod (4th quarter 2001) there weren't corners that rounded that I personally remember.> they need to be on a functional item, like a phone"
"That's a curious thing. I was in an art store and saw a glass statue that was claimed to be patented. I looked up the patent, and it was a design patent on using a laser to crack glass in the particular way this statue was cracked. I don't remember if it was a patent on the laser, or on the artwork, or on the technique, but unless a glass bust is a functional item I'm not sure this assertion is 100% true.A paper weight is technically functional. You can get a design patent on a carpet pattern, possibly wall carpets (read: wall art) as well. I'm not patent lawyer so I can't get into the nitty gritty of the case law, but overall design patents are ornamental parts of things and regular patents are functional. Cracking the glass in a specific way is an ornamental part of a thing of arguable function.OK, cool. I just wasn't sure what functional meant, in contrast to perhaps merely decorative. :-)Functional basically means that the item has some purpose which it could still fulfill just the same if it were designed differently."
"A paperweight could be any shape and still hold down paper. So a particular shape can be a purely artistic choice.The rounded corners patent was originally for the [first generation iPad](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/IPad_1_PSD_Mockup.png/150px-IPad_1_PSD_Mockup.png), which came out in 2010. Here's a [Samsung digital picture frame](http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2006/03/samsungpictureframe.jpg) from 2006."
"There was genuinely nothing original about rounded corners in that form factor at all. Remember a design patent has nothing to do with the purpose, only the visual/mechanical design so it doesn't matter that they had different uses.But Apples design was much more advanced, it describes how the speaker is placed where it always was on phones, and how you can add a button and otherwise nothing else. I particularly like that the patent stresses the nothing else part, and still manages to win in a US court despite no less than 2 logos and 3 buttons added after the do nothing else part. I guess the meaning of nothing isn't quite clear.The coffee table we had when I was a kid had rounded corners, puhh-leez.The rounded corners thing is an oversimplification. But as that shows there are items that still carry many of the same characteristics that make an iPad look like an iPad."
"But despite this, Samsung clearly was not just victims of accidental similarity.  They even made the box look nearly identical."
"http://appleinsider.com/articles/11/08/15/apple_accused_of_faking_evidence_in_eu_ipad_case_against_samsung"
"(see section on the boxes 2/3rds the way down the page)"
"The defense against Apple's claims is that Apple's designs are so generic that you don't have to copy them to have your devices look the same. But there's no way this is the case with the box, Samsung set out to copy the iPad and did.The logic of this one defeats me. They were using the design elements from their own earlier digital picture frame as shown above. You can't say it's a copy of Apple when the design elements in question were stolen from them by Apple. Even if it was quite deliberate of Samsung to emulate the iPad they'd *still* be in the right because they originated those design elements.> They were using the design elements from their own earlier digital picture frame as shown above."
"So that's why the box is so similar in design? Your logic defies me. You just ignore the stuff that doesn't fit your notion?The box is another topic entirely, with different design elements. We were talking about the rounded corners design patent. The design of a cardboard box doesn't relate to this design patent.> But there's no way this is the case with the box, Samsung set out to copy the iPad and did."
"What?? It's a fucking white box. "
"Not to mention the designs and use of the space on the box are fairly different, but that shouldn't matter at all. Cos if you can't sell your product in a white box because someone already sells their product in a white box, then this world is shit.> Not to mention the designs and use of the space on the box are fairly different"
"You have a different definition of fairly different than I do. The other guy linking to the Sony one, I'd say that's fairly different. It has a Sony shape in the corner, different colored sides.* Different projections of product"
"* iPad is extremely minimalist with only a picture of the product and the name on the side; Galaxy contains numerous symbols, with the name of the product on the top and side and a (presumably) specifications sticker on the side, and a green thingamajig on the corner"
"Really not sure what else they could do differently, except use different colours.I'm not saying that they copied the box or not, but it is just a white box with a picture of the tablet on it. I'm quite sure that the iPad is not the first product with such a box. Maybe (probably) Samsung chose it to look more similar to the iPad, but it is still a really generic box.No man, you don't understand.  This is _Apple's_ box.  It is original and unique by default just because of that.  /sThat's kind of a stretch to say they copied the box design.  Lots of boxes have a similar design and Samsung's box definitely has a lot more going on in its design.  If Samsung copied the box design, then I guess Sony did too - http://www.hardwareheaven.com/reviewimages/sony-tablet-s/sony-tablet-s_box1.jpg.  Pretty much every tablet and smartphone are packaged similarly too.  I know my Nexus 7 and every phone I've owned have come packed like that.  Here's the Nexus 7 http://fiddlesaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Nexus7.jpg"
"With a black box in the corner and black sides? I don't see why you think that's nearly the same."
"And the Sony opens conventionally with you opening the side upwards and then flipping the top back instead of the top lifting off as a section like on the Samsung and Apple boxes. Also, it doesn't look identical to the Apple and Samsung inside. It doesn't present the unit the at the top in a borderless presentation, instead it has a sheet of instructions over the pad inside."
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEimjd3nncAThere's nothing original about a box top that slides off.  Lots of products have that sort of packaging (Nexus 6 for example).  The face of the Galaxy box has a logo, floating icons, some green box in the top right corner, a different orientation and size of the product and there is also a ton of writing and labels on the sides that doesn't exist on Apple's box.  They are quite different.  Sony's later tablet boxes have white sides too http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y2NppIyoqnc/maxresdefault.jpg."
"> There's nothing original about a box top that slides off. Lots of products have that sort of packaging."
"Actually, there is. Sure, they existed before Apple, but no, lots of companies didn't use it for electronics until Apple used it first."
"Look at the unboxings I posted here:"
"https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/3ierdy/apple_loses_slide_to_unlock_patent_in_a_lawcase/cug1rb4"
"There is not a lot of floating icons and logos and green boxes on the Samsung box. No a lot of writing and labels on the side that don't exist on Apple's box.So Apple is original because they used an existing packaging type for an electronic device?  Come on man.  I'm sure there are electronics that were packaged like that before Apple's stuff, but I'm not going to waste my time looking for them because you'll just find something else to nitpick or stretch.  "
"And that's a totally different box than what was shown in that first link you posted.  There's a big bright shiny Galaxy Tab logo right on the front of the box.  If you get those two boxes confused, you're blind.  The HTC HD2 box face design is similar to that too."
"Edit:  Still laughing to myself for the it's original because Apple did it reasoning.  Good one lol.I don't see any sane reason why we should act to protect box shape.Thank you.

"I see you're drowning in KoolAid.iOS was an innovation. It was powerful yet easy to use for non-techies and was miles ahead of its contemporaries.But couldn't send text messages or so copy and paste.... I think people are forgetting just how horrible the first iPhones really were. I didn't use a first gen iPhone, so I can't say how lacking it was or wasn't."
"However, I remember how awful phones were at that time and I appreciate that the iPhone helped push that market forward and break the lock that the carriers had on available phones and features.MMS messages not text messages. But iOS was mere conglomerate of ideas an design approaches invented long before. Novelty thing was composition of all of this in a consistent way - and that's exactly what is claimed above. Except Apple had been developing mobile stuff for decades, even long before the Newton stuff. "
"I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the similar ideas were spawned from Apple's R&D during that time. So just making it up as you go along? >was mere conglomerate of ideas an design approaches invented long before"
"I suppose you don't read novels because they're just a conglomerate of letters invented long before.And you can't copyright claim trope. You can pursuit someone for using your specific implementation, eg. novel word by word, but not the general idea.It was the first polished, consumer friendly version of technology that until then had been very poorly implemented. So they didn't invent many things, but they were the first to do most of those things well. Why exclude implementation from invention? I mean the Wright brothers only really made the plane work whereas people before them did drew up all sorts of barely functional flying machines."
"I feel like the original iPhone's popularity really shaped the industry for all phones that followed. I for one got an iPhone back in the day because my friend let me have a play with his and it was far more responsive than I ever imagined."
"I guess the same thing can be seen again in the recent TouchID implementation. Sure finger-print scanning is old technology, but there has to be some innovation involved in making it as easy and responsive as it is, especially when it's miles ahead of those found in laptops and other competing devices.While you're certainly right, it's also hard to find any idea that isn't in some way a conglomerate of or inspired by ideas invented long before--as is the nature of time.Are you talking about the same iOS that powered the first iPhone devices? The one that did not have a copy-paste in it, and no integration between programs? The one where if you received an email with a phone number and wanted to call it, your best bet was to write it down on a piece of paper and dial manually?"
"Surely they made it great eventually. But when it came out - it was pure garbage. And just to put that in the perspective, contemporaries were J2ME-powered devices, with online stores with games, ebooks, dictionaries and navigation aides."
"The only innovative thing Apple did in iOS was bundling app-store with the OS, so that average Joe can install whatever. Contemporaries required user to actually find a link or a short code to install an app, or usage of an ugly USB cable. >The only innovative thing Apple did in iOS was bundling app-store with the OS, so that average Joe can install whatever.

"That too falls under they made it great later. The app store launched a year after the iPhone. I fully agree that iPhones are excellent devices *now*, but in 2007 they really weren't that great.> It was powerful"
"No, original iOS was a piece of shit. It was completely inferior to Symbian at the time in every functional sense, it just looked pretty.So the web browser was better.

"It isn't any mystery why LG never went through with their lawsuit.To anyone who doesn't want to circlejerk about how Apple has invented basic shapes:"
"First off, the infamous 'rounded corners' patent wasn't for the first generation iPad. Since design patents are just literally designs and they don't usually contain a description, the first time an Apple patent was described as having rounded corners was when Apple filed a motion for a [preliminary injunction in 2011](http://www.scribd.com/doc/59149837/11-07-01-Apple-Motion-for-PI-Against-Samsung) against Samsung products. "
"In this motion, Apple lawyers describe several designs as having rounded corners. Here is an example of a description of one design;"
">* a flat, clear, black-colored, rectangular front surface with four evenly rounded corners;"
"* an inset rectangular display screen centered on the front surface that leaves very narrow borders on either side of the display screen and substantial borders above and below the display screen; and"
"* a rounded, horizontal speaker slot centered on the front surface above the display screen,"
"* where the rectangular front surface is otherwise substantially free of ornamentation outside of an optional button area centrally located below the display."
"As is immediately obvious to anyone; Apple doesn't claim rounded corners. They claim a design which has rounded corners. The design also has a 'rectangular display screen', or a 'horizontal speaker slot', neither of which Apple claims to own. It would be just as accurate to say that Apple thinks it invented rectangular screens. (as in, not accurate at all)"
"Note that the first time the 'rounded corners' come up is to describe D677, which refers to design patent [US D618677](http://www.google.com/patents/USD618677). Note how this patent itself has no reference at all to rounded corners hence that phrase is solely a lawyers words describing the patent. Note how this patent was filed Nov 18, 2008. There are multiple other design patents all of which are also described as having rounded corners, some filed even earlier. (some as early as 2004, but lets not discuss that one because Samsung was ruled to not have infringed that specific one, but Samsung was ruled to have infringed on designs described as having rounded corners filed in 2007 too)"
"If I compare two cars and say *'your car looks like mine, it is blue, has four wheels, and they are both 2010 fords'*, I wouldn't be saying that all cars that are blue and have four wheels look like my car. Similarly, this one lawyer is saying *'both these phones have rounded corners, square screens, and a bunch of other physical features'*, and everybody is going home with 'the lawyer said that all phones which have rounded corners are iPhones'. "
"The thing is, regardless of the way you describe the designs, it isn't about the description. It is about the actual designs and the way they look. You can describe them however you want and it doesn't affect the actual patent. I could easily describe [this design](http://www.google.com/patents/USD618677) as 'phone with a flat front surface'. This doesn't affect what the patent is and isn't."
"So why does the whole 'Apple patented rounded corners' myth persist? Why isn't it the 'Apple patented rectangular screens' myth or the 'Apple patented speaker slots' myth? When you look at the legal document all of those are basically the same misconception. The thing is, Google/Samsung didn't say 'Apple patented rectangular screens'. [They did say 'Apple patented rounded corners' in PR statements.](http://allthingsd.com/20120824/apple-says-verdict-is-a-win-for-values-samsung-says-its-a-loss-for-consumers/)"
"Here is more information on the [rounded corners myth](http://www.fosspatents.com/2012/09/claim-check-if-apple-patented-rounded.html). To anyone still not convinced, ask yourself this;"
"1. Apple sued Samsung for having rounded corners"
"2. Apple won and Samsung lost"
"3. Samsung still makes phones/tablets with rounded corners today"
"How does that work? Or how about this."
"1. Apple sued Samsung for having rounded corners"
"2. Apple won and Samsung lost"
"3. Everybody else also makes devices with rounded cornersThis is an interesting post... nevertheless, to my knowledge in Europe design patents are granted to unique designs and they have to be shown as unique (which those product designs were hardly). I can't believe there are people alive who actually think Apple invented rounded corners on mobile electronic devices.I don't think there are people who are. I just think there are people who think that calling a specific patent a patent for rounded corners is a vast oversimplification of that patent. If you care, here is [the actual patent](http://www.google.com/patents/USD593087) which is among those which is called the rounded corners patent.> I just think there are people who think that calling a specific patent a patent for rounded corners is a vast oversimplification of that patent."
"That's because people think that having a bezel, putting the button below the screen and the speaker where the ear is is even less worthy of a design patent than the rounded corners.As confusing as this is about to sound, I don't believe anyone actually thinks Apple invented rounded corners. But there are plenty of people who think others think that Apple invented rounded corners. "
"If I recall correctly, the case was more about Samsung deliberately designing their devices to mislead consumers and capitalize on Apple's existing brand recognition. It wasn't We invented this design, you can't use it, it was more, you're intentionally trying to trick people into thinking that's an iPhone.Something to hold in your hand probably should have round corners... like a pebble from the river, goddammit. For those curious, there was actually a pebble phone: [PEBL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Pebl) by motorola."
"Speaking out of experience doing J2ME games until 2006 or so: Motorola is generally quite good at phones, it's always been my second favourite after Nokia. Siemens went under very deservedly, Samsung seems to have gotten its shit together in android times."
"Back in those days... you know, having different chargers for different companies was the norm. Samsung had different chargers for each bloody model. Often they would even fit, but not charge. Pure madness."
"That job experience also made me capable of replacing SIM cards while blindfolded. Which can be rather impressing I'm told, doing it to phones that are ringing in a meeting while simultaneously staring people down. Like a marine disassembling a gun.I had one. It was a damn good phone. The rubberized shell, durability... and the slide to open... It was pretty rare to see others have one though.Is there any info about how TTIP will affect german patent rights?Well the problem I think they were trying to solve, which Jobs said in the keynote announcing the original iPhone, was to prevent it from unlocking in your pocket by accident. It wasn't something that was easy to do accidentally but easy enough to do intentionally. > Jobs said in the keynote announcing the original iPhone, was to prevent it from unlocking in your pocket by accident. It wasn't something that was easy to do accidentally but easy enough to do intentionally."
"Really about as obvious as a door knob that 'doesn't open accidentally but is easy enough to open intentionally'.You clearly know absolutely nothing about design. Things that are simple to understand are not necessarily simple to design. It's pretty fucking hard to make shit up. Impermissible hindsight bias.So much that it spawned a time machine and made Neonode build it years before Apple It was not obvious enough to put on any pocketpc, symbian, or android device that was available prior to the iPhone. I really wish I had that on my pocketpc. "
"Clearly it is obvious now. Aren't some of the best designs the ones that are obvious after they are implemented? Line the Neonode from years before Apple that did it? So very much not already obvious To be fair, the door knob was a brilliant invention back in its day.Before door knobs there was no way to stop doors from accidentally opening in your pocket/r/fifthworldproblemsI carry a knob in my pocket at all timesYour point regarding German patent law is true of, at least, the UK (inventive step) and US (non obvious) as well. "
"A key point is that the 'rounded corners' you discuss was a __design__ patent rather than a utility patent. Design patents (or just 'designs' in Europe) only protect the way a product looks, whereas a utility patent protects the way something works. How the hell do you patent a design? That should be copyright, trademark, etc."
"A patent is fundamentally supposed to be about an innovative way to solve a problem. Not just a new drawing.It's less of a general design patent and more a do not copy law. Eg. Shoes that are made to look like a certain shoe so a consumer doesn't buy a ripoff  shoe while thinking it is the original.Clothing is actually one thing that cannot be patented, the only thing designers can do is put a logo on it which is trademarked.You don't patent a design, you patent an invention :)"
"That being said, IP law grants protection to designers who, provided that the depose their designs at the local IP office, have some additional protections on top of copyright law - if the latter applies."
"Which is why you can't design your phone to look exactly like the last IPhone.> How the hell do you patent a design?"
"You don't. It's called an industrial design right in Europe and is more akin to a trademark than a patent (but it's not a trademark). As far as I know, only USA calls them design patents which confuses a lot of people.In Germany, they are even called taste templates, or, to use a less direct translation, design trademarks.And the movie 'Predator' incidentally.Slide to detonate.[For those curious, here's the first clip that came up searching for it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRAKBBGbf4A)  Dude is totally right.even as the click sound lolYou did watch it didn't you? "
"You realise in the movie siri doesn't actually tell him how much wood a wood chuck would chuck if a wood chuck could chuck wood? "
"(the click was just another sound effect added to be like an iphone)i was not expecting this gold.When they make movies they always have interviews with actors, the director, maybe the writers, sometimes the special effects people. I want to know who came up with this. How did they decide each of those movements would be needed to start a timer for the bomb?God I forgot about that laughHe's not unlocking it he's just using Predator Tinder. You know, like Jared uses. So you're telling me my man, Steve Jobs, wasn't a genius? What's next? Global warming? Puh-leez...He was a genius in making people believe he was a genius."
"Geniusception!Marketing is a real skill. He was best at that. Love him or hate him (which Reddit does), you cannot deny that he did a HELL of a lot more than marketing. It was his vision that defined him, not his marketing team. He was best at being the leader of Apple.Not sure why you are getting downvotes. Marketing wasn't his biggest skill - TBWA\Chiat\Day came up with the greatest of the Apple commercials and marketing campaigns (1984, Think Different, Get a Mac) - Jobs was just the one who gave it the OK."
"Jobs was an incredible leader. His real skill was pushing skilled people in the right direction to create great products. He knew what he wanted, and he found people who could make it possible, then sweet talk or harass them into getting there."
"What has always made Apple stand out is the little bit extra that they put into their products to make it great, often taking risks and making compromises to meet the vision of the product. For example look at the MacBook Air - it was an amazing idea which fell short in performance, but was still a great product.> pushing skilled people in the right direction"
"As in away from him because he smelled?"
"Just a joke, I couldn't resist from making it. What you said is indeed right.Ok you can take his dick out of your ass now. He'd dead Jim.We'll never know, but how much of that was Jony Ive's insistence on product design and Steve Jobs basically trusted him?>- Jobs was just the one who gave it the OK."
">Jobs was an incredible leader. His real skill was pushing skilled people in the right direction to create great products. He knew what he wanted, and he found people who could make it possible, then sweet talk or harass them into getting there."
"THIS is exactly right. People keep saying he was a great marketer AND designer. He didn't design shit, he got people to design.Taking risks, until 2008. Then everything they released was the same shit, with minor tweaks, until the Apple Watch, which was just androids idea, tweaked a little, and released at a higher price. Really, the single biggest thing Apple really excels at is the drive for perfection - something that Jobs really brought to the corporate culture.  There are plenty of stories about Apple's push for perfection that comes to mind, but the one that stands out is the manufacturing process for one of their earlier MacBook Pro models.  Jobs was handed a CNC prototyped device and gave it a thumbs up, but after the first devices came off the manufacturing line, Jobs hated it.  The grain on the aluminum wasn't uniform, and it just didn't have the same *perfect finish* as the prototyped model he was given."
"The problem was that traditional manufacturing methods - die-casting and stamping - couldn't give you a 100% consistent look-and-feel.  Here is where most manufacturers will have a fuck it moment and just push ahead.  But not Apple, they went out and spent something like a quarter billion dollars on thousands of CNC prototyping machines, using them to custom-bore every single MacBook Pro body from a solid block of aluminum."
"Little aesthetic details like this is what really sets Apple apart from their competition.  When most companies will see something as a small-but-acceptable flaw or imperfection caused by the manufacturing process, Apple sees a road block.  Like the time when the designers at Apple wanted to incorporate a sleep light in the case without actually showing a hole through the aluminum to see it, so they went out and bought a company that could drill 20 um holes in the case - big enough to let light through unhindered, but small enough to not be visible by the naked eye.  Or the time when no manufacturer would create a thinner, oddly shaped battery cell that would fit their machine's design, so they started manufacturing them on their own."
"Many people who exclusively buy Apple devices do so because of that attention to detail.  While competitors are fine with just function and price - as are many customers, Apple focuses not only on the function, but also the look and feel.I'm getting downvotes because the Anti-Apple/Jobs cabal here can't see beyond their blind hatred for the man. It's like they literally can't give any credit to him, as if Apple could have been an iota of what it is today, and have a subsequent impact on today's world without him. Was he generally an unpleasant person? Sure. Misguided in some aspects? Who isn't? A tyrant? Yes. But to deny that he was a leader and visionary that had HUGE impact on his company and the world is completely ignorant.Read what the creative director of TBWA said about the campaigns jobs oversaw and you'll get some idea of what he did.Obligatory: [Has Apple Really Ever Invented Anything?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFeC25BM9E0)As an answer to the question without watching the video yet... "
"No. And thats not a bad thing, but its still annoying. "
"Apple and Steve Jobs' strength wasnt necessarily inventing an idea. It was marketing it at the right time with the right 'sell'. Steve Jobs was one of the best marketers of all time. "
"Where it became annoying as shit was when that marketing turned into 'we invented this' just because they were the first ones to take already developed ideas and make them popular. best marketer of all time, kind of like being the prettiest piece of shit. If a product is good, it does a hundred times as much good in the hands of a hundred million people, than in the hands of only one million. The difference is marketing."
"I'm saying that as a person who's poor at it. I respect the contributions of those who do it well.> best marketer of all time, kind of like being the prettiest piece of shit. "
"Second best, greatest trick ever pulled was with diamonds by De BeersI remember when I was doing sales our team watched an apple presentation and our manager was solely harping on how they specifically try to make their customers *feel* special and better for buying their products. He kept telling us to emulate the genius of don't sell the product, sell the idea to people. Make them want to be a superior person for having bought it.  their last press conference was funny. "
"we have made the smaller logic board EVER! <pause> <applause> ^^^^ ^^^^In ^^^^a ^^^^macbook ^^^^Apple are good at marketing. But what they did better than anybody else (at least historically) was pay attention to the user experience."
"There were smart phones prior to the iPhone. There were mp3 players before the iPod. But Apple did them right."
"Because it's ultimately not about technical specifications. It's about how the user *feels* when using the device, and Apple were the first to really make the engineering department take the back seat and let the emotional state of the user be the driver.Exactly! There were touchscreen phones before the iPhone, but they were not nearly as nice to use. Apple went and did their darndest to make a good phone with a touchscreen, then Android phones responded, then Apple did some more stuff, Android did some other stuff and some years later here we are with a shitload of good (but also  expensive) smartphones. Apple didn't invent the smartphone or the touchscreen but they did have a huge input on the direction smartphones would take in the future.Steve Jobs in Civilization V is a Great Merchant. They did a lot of cool things with the Great People."
"My favorite: Rosalind Franklin is a Great Scientist."
"Watson and Crick aren't!I'm going to keep making this comment until people listen to me and either agree or dispute it: "
"What people attribute to Apple's marketing isn't just marketing. Marketing (in this context) isn't valuable to the consumer, it's a sort of trickery. But design is. Apple is primarily a design company, not a marketing company, not a company that invents things. The reason people buy Apple computers isn't just because they're marketed better, it's because they're designed better for those people."
"You don't look at a beautiful painting and say Oh, well, you know, that painter didn't invent paint or canvas. Therefore the reason anyone buys this painting over another painting is just because the painter employed more marketing rhetoric."
"You could design a webpage for your business or you could pay a talented professional to do it. They may have the same features. Buttons, information about your company, etc. But one will be shit, and the other people will like. This may be obvious with a webpage, but it's also true of objects, computers included. It's more enjoyable to use a well designed product. Aesthetically, tactically and functionally."
"Apple makes products that work fairly seamlessly together and independently. They're easy to use and they feel and look nice. That makes people like them. That's why people buy them. That's why people pay more for them. It's not just because their ads are that much better than every other company's. If you took an ad for a Macbook and swapped in the [Razer Blade 2015](http://koolwallpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Razer-blade.jpg), college girls everywhere wouldn't be using Razer Blade 2015s, they'd still want Macbooks. Macbooks are pretty, they don't look like a 14 year old boy made one, or like they were cobbled together by engineers who wanted to meet a spec sheet for the lowest price."
"Steve Jobs seems to have known something that people here talking shit about him (with regard to his value to the business. He still deserves lots of shit talked about him) still don't even understand in retrospect: The value of good design."
"I hate being in this position too, because I want to shit all over Apple for all the things they *do* deserve to be shit on for. Like making products that obfuscate their function such that people never learn how anything works when they use them, or for the walled garden ecosystem and attitude that degrades the experience when using non-Apple products with Apple products. But it's so annoying to keep hearing Oh, it's just all marketing.You make fair points. I would argue that you are confusing marketing with advertising, in which case you are perfectly correct. "
"One of the most important pillars of marketing is the product itself, and designing products that provide value is one of the core principles of marketing. "
"I completely agree with you in the sense that not all the ads in the world can sell a product that isnt properly designed, but I also definately think that having valuable products is firmly under the realm of marketing. I think you said something that encompasses the reason why Apple succeeded at selling to so many the people. Their greatest marketing achievement was convincing people that what they are selling is art when in reality it's simply esthetically appealing design and user functionality. This mirrors the competitors rather nicely by giving the user a wider cushion from the technical underpinnings of their pc and an understanding of what makes their device tick, all while giving them something pretty to look at."
"All I'm saying here is that Apple used what I consider brilliant design to target (through clever marketing) a group of people who aren't drawn to a more technical device; i.e. the artists and college girls of the world. "
"Well saidGood point. Agree with what you said. But here's the thing... They keep saying they invented' all that shit and that the technology is  revolutionary  or the cringeworthy insanely great if you will...Well, you got me. I agree with you.You are correct, but what you describe is, for good reason, not supposed to be patentable. It's not invention.I would say that a lot of famous artists are famous because they did something new.  They didn't invent paint or canvas,  but they created new styles, breaking from previous conventions. This is especially true in the late 1800s to present day in the US and Europe. In their time,  the artists might not have even been famous.  If comparing Apple products to art, you'd have to go with a modern,  currently producing artist because Apple is currently producing their products.  Comparing people purchasing Apple to buying  Van Gough doesn't work.  (sorry for any misspellings, im on my phone) people underestimate design."
"and often confuse it with marketing too.That's because design and marketing overlap a lot. "
"Great post, unfortunately, the position is your alone and not the one that Apple shares or has been promoting."
"Apple has good aesthetics (design is too technical in this case) and great marketing. That is about it.And honestly, only 13% of Americans own a mac computer.   They are not that popular in the US.The Macbook was cobbled together by designers to look pretty, not by engineers who understand cooling.Most early marketing classes talk about the [4 Ps:](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_mix)"
"* Product: what is it and does it fit the target market"
"* Promotion: where do people in your market hear about it and what do you say"
"* Placement: where do people in your market buy it"
"* Price: is it the right cost for the market"
"You're picking one part of marketing from the whole. "
"Apple is a great marketing company because they so consistently nail all 4 Ps. "
"Deter Rams comes to mind when you consider design. I remember in my college art class having that discussion. The side by side comparison pictures were better, but I couldn't figure out where my teacher got them. Maybe she made them."
"http://www.cultofmac.com/188753/the-braun-products-that-inspired-apples-iconic-designs-gallery/Andy Warhol absolutely sold his paintings and got famous because of his weird persona and marketing rhetoric.  It certainly wasn't because of the quality of his paintings."
"But your point stands.  I agree.> I hate being in this position too, because I want to shit all over Apple for all the things they do deserve to be shit on for. Like making products that obfuscate their function such that people never learn how anything works when they use them, or for the walled garden ecosystem and attitude that degrades the experience when using non-Apple products with Apple products. But it's so annoying to keep hearing Oh, it's just all marketing."
"Aye! Exactly! Very well said."
"I dislike Apple for the same reasons. But it is not trivial how they brought technology to people when no one else did.Not exactly true. Back in the beginning the *only* thing Apple did that no other computer did was line up a nationwide school distribution contract. In the 80's it was Commodore and Tandy that brought the computer to the home, not Apple. For Apples part, they create the Mac in the late 80's, a move that jump starts the use of graphical interfaces on computers. Absolutely, 100% correct and I agree with every word. Jobs annoyed the fucking shit out of me but he was good at what he did."
"Hope you don't get downvoted to shit by people who don't understand.I still hate the sterile, identity-lacking look of everything they produce.TL:DR: Jobs had a natural understanding of what the average consumer wants and the proper personality to go against the current standards > I hate being in this position too, because I want to shit all over Apple for all the things they do deserve to be shit on for. Like making products that obfuscate their function such that people never learn how anything works when they use them, or for the walled garden ecosystem and attitude that degrades the experience when using non-Apple products with Apple products. But it's so annoying to keep hearing Oh, it's just all marketing."
"While I 100% agree with the rest of your comment, this part in particular struck me as odd."
"Something I've always felt, and still defend to this day, is that Apple makes OSX in a way that you can go as deep as you want but you're never forced to."
"My example is myself. I tend to almost never use the mouse and I spend over half of my time in the terminal. "
"Every time I've needed to learn something new it hasn't been far away or harder than in, say, Linux or BSD (the other ones I use). If anything, Windows has constantly seemed to me like a black box of weakly-held bits of string and sticks where the best solution tends to be just reinstall (and it's the official solution in the F500 company I work for if any issue takes longer than 30 minutes to fix)."
"Even when Apple drops advanced support of some way (for example, dropping Samba in Lion for their own SMB2 solution) it's not complex to add it yourself, if you know you need it (in this case, I made a tool for it, but someone else would've if not)."
"If you're referring to iOS then I wouldn't be so adamant but at least regarding OSX I wholly disagree.I consider OSX and the mac in a completely different light from the phones. The machines themselves are excellent, and the os is precisely as you described. But iOS (and the devices) are the opposite. They're downright user hostile if you try to do anything outside prescribed, simplest use.I think a lot of what you say is true. But I also think there is definitely a strong marketing value to Apple too. Part of the value is better (or at least better for that user) design. But part is definitely that it was the must have device, it was cooler, part of it was brand loyalty, partially inspired by design but also partially inspired by the coolness cult that Apple inspired. I think a lot of that has died down in the last couple of years. But the other marketing driver, market saturation still exists building on it. Try finding a decent stereo dock for a samsung off the shelf.  And a lot of that is a mix of that design you mention but also the marketing that used its market position to build it up even further."
"Tl;dr I agree they did some good design stuff, but then they also took that and marketed the shit out of it to the extent that the brand became a significant part of the product. They are not alone in doing this but they did it to an extent not often seen.When the average person refers to any tablet as an iPad, they're doing something right. I would say that that is not only marketing strength but also a mastery of analyzing what the current market wants and pouncing on products at the right time. As the other reply to your comment said, many people consider iPad and tablet to be synonymous. But I would attribute this more to Apple introducing the first well-made consumer tablet to the world. At the time it seemed like a strange move (why do I need a big iPhone? I already have one.) but in retrospect they not only struck at the exact time that the world was moving towards a mobile life, but also kickstarted an entire market for tablets that didn't exist before (remember Android Honeycomb?). When you can single-handedly generate a new market like that, you've struck at the right time. I like this argument. "
"Although, I still feel like a lot of their products have a bad case of function following form: itunes, OSX dock and window management, and pretty much every mouse Apple has ever made. I think form over function applies to all their products. I still can't work out how to turn my thunderbolt display off without unplugging it. The funny thing with Apple is that their hardware development teams are the gold-standard of the industry, but once it's passed to their software teams, there's problems.   "
"iTunes has taken a lot of warranted criticism for making it just too cumbersome to manage what should be a simple library of music files, to give an example.   iPods are great but I hate iTunes with a passion.You're just going the other extreme."
"Yes, Apple isn't just a marketing company, but they also aren't just a design company."
"If you put a macbook under the name Acer and gave it the same marketing Acer gives its products, it would not sell anywhere close to the number of the exact same product Apple sells."
"The other factor that also comes in to play is brand value.  "
"It has become cool to own an Apple, cooler than owning the exact same thing under a different name.that brand value is the dividend of consistent good design starting with the iMac in the late 90's, then the iBook, iPod, etc."
"People who use Apple products will have good experiences with their products, and keep buying more Apple products, even if there other companies out there that might have better products, but also a lot of inferior ones.> The reason people buy Apple computers isn't just because they're marketed better, it's because they're designed better for those people."
"This right here is something that a lot of people seem to miss when figuring out why some companies enjoy moderate success, while others become ingrained into our culture and way of life. I don't know if you came to this conclusion on your own, /u/OneBigBug or if you saw the same TED talk I did, but if you haven't I can't recommend [The Golden Circle] (http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en) by Simon Sinek enough! Some pretty interesting stuff that he talks about.Good point. Agree with what you said. But here's the thing... They keep saying they invented' all that shit and that the technology is  revolutionary  or the cringeworthy insanely great if you will..."
"Edit: Also, Jobs put multiple patents on the way the iPod Nano is placed in its box. That's just petty coming from a company that prides itself on innovation"
"He put a patent on the way you place something in a box? That is possible? Holy shit.What made me cringe was the Retina label, for simply a high-DPI screen.   Yeah, it's like taking an 8-cylinder engine and market it as a Super Engine then sue if anyone else calls their engine that, even if it's also an 8-cylinder engine.   "
"I talked to an Apple fanatic once about Retina back when the Nexus 10 came out.   Higher DPI display than the iPad had at the time but he couldn't believe it was any good since it wasn't a Retina display.Good thing slide to unlock has been replaced with thumbprintYe but now that Apple has all your thumbprints in their DB... But to be fair Apple seem o be doing their part speaking up for encryption against the NSA"
"EDIT: Good morning reddit! I seem to have missed the point that your thumbprint doesn't leave you Apple device. Sorry I don't tend to use Apple so don't keep up too much on their news."
"EDIT2: You guys are angry in the morning -13 (and sliding) in about 10 mins."
"EDIT3: This is turning into a joke now... Your downvotes cant hurt me!The thumbprint is stored locally on a secure chip inside the device. Your print is nowhere except physically inside the device in your hand.That's not how it works. If I recall, the fingerprint is stored in the secure element of the SoC. It is not stored in the OS files or backed up to Apple servers. Reddit is shit hot this morning. 5 replies in 2-3 minutes. Ye I don't read much of apple news. Just thought the idea of having your fingerprint on a device is a bad idea. ANy idea if this has been independently verified though? Would be interested to see if the guys at Defcon can get this info.Nope. Apple has no fingerprint database. All fingerprint storage and checking happens on the physical device, with no communication of it elsewhere.How would you know this? Its proprietary software, you must assume they keep all your shit with proprietary software."
"Edit: Praise be FOSSThe fact that it's been around for nearly 2 years and the jailbreaking community has yet to touch the Secure Enclave should be a pretty good indication."
"You can only get a yes/no response from the enclave. What DB?  All fingerprints are stored mathematically on chip and on device.  There is no way for Apple to decrypt your data if the phone is locked.Fair enough have edited my post...I mean I don't have even the faintest glimmer of being able to validate this with my own work, but apparently the prints stay on your device in an encrypted chip. It's not even the print, either. It's essentially a hash of the data about the print, something that can be verified when the finger is scanned agin in the future, but not enough data to reconstruct the actual print on its own. Bruh you really don't think they could get your fingerprint from your phone if they wanted to?I get what you're saying but without any evidence I have to disregard this type of thinking.I guess I'm just cynical. I assume that if they wanted to the government could access anything made by an American company, and probably a lot of international ones too.One-way algorithms are not a thing of policies and politics though.  They simply exist.Perhaps on a long enough timeline but if something is made to not store data in a harmful way, it won't magically start because big brother wills it.How do you know how the data is stored though? It's proprietary.All available sources claim that the data is just hash data of parts of a print, not the entire thing. I have no solid proof of that I suppose but there's nothing but conjecture and conspiracy saying otherwise. Neither stance is provable by you or I. To quote someone awesome I get what you're saying but without any evidence I have to disregard this type of thinking.Noobie here, are all finger print hashes made using the same formula? Because if they are can't you just reverse the formula to turn a hash back into the raw thumbprint data? Unless of course the data is even more vague than that.The point of hashes is the data can't be mutated back. The way you check passwords/thumbprints is you hash it again and check if it matches the existing hash. You would need to run every possible fingerprint through the hashing process and check it against the hash to know the original hash.The algorithms for hashes are one-way, meaning you can easily go from source to hash, but going from hash to source is very hard (due to loss of information, mainly)."
"For example, let's say you have the string:"
"I am a walrus"
"And our hash algorithm is The number of letters in each word."
"The hash for our string would be: 1 2 1 6. From a hash of 1216 you cannot easily go back to I am a walrus."
"Now, this is a very crude example - our hash algorithm is extremely insecure, because if we have the hash of 1216 we can arbitrarily generate strings that are different than the source string, but would still yield the same hash.  This is known as 'collision'. Actual hashing algorithms such as [SHA-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) are more resilient to collisions."
"Apple is hashing your fingerprint, so they have a hashing algorithm and they store the hash of your fingerprint. When you scan it, they just take the scan, hash it, and verify it against their stored hash."
"Their operation is probably more complex than that - because their algorithm should be flexible enough to detect the same fingerprint in various differing positions.Thanks for that amazing explanation. I was also wondering how they can scan every finger perfectly as to create the same hash. Maybe they can detect the orientation of the finger or they can find the center of your print. Maybe it looks at distance between finger print rings?I really like your explanation. But couldn't as with your hash several different fingerprints result in the same hash and therefore reduce security (ie in your example different sentences could lead to the same hash value) ? I don't know anything about such stuff so my question may be dumb. That's a very good question. Yes, the simple hash function I've described is very insecure, because it's vulnerable to hash collision: Two different sentences could lead to the same hash. Real-life hash functions are much more complex, and are designed to avoid these collisions, partly by having longer hashes."
"Furthermore, real-life hash functions are designed in a way that two slightly differing inputs generate wildly different hashes."
"Let's show this using the SHA1 algorithm. For the input Hello world we get this hash:   "
"33ab5639bfd8e7b95eb1d8d0b87781d4ffea4d5d"
"If we modify our sentence very very slightly, by changing the initial H to I (a change of just one letter, changing it to the very next letter), we get Iello world which has this hash:"
"c846d1588da92463ef51af57d40f64df20a31531"
"As you can see, the two hashes are very different although the source input is very similar. Hmm that statement is a little misleading, it's not really possible to use a cryptographic hash on biometrics because biometric scanners don't produce the same exact result every time. For example for a finger print orientation of finger, pressure applied, sweat level etc all change every time a user scans their finger."
"For a standard cryptographic hash, any tiny change should have a  a dramatic change on the has function. This is obviously makes it unusable for biometrics, and it's something that is actually being actively researched at my university."
"There are a few alternatives, but as far as I'm away (it's not my area of expertise, but I have discussed this not that long ago with researchers in this area) they aren't perfect yet, still kind of in their early stages for being reliable enough to deploy."
"I've had a quick look and apart from source less news articles I can't actually find any evidence of apple actually applying a proper one way hash on their biometric data. If you have some info about this I'd love to have a read to figure out what approach they took, and how much they had to compromise."
"That all said, regardless of what they're doing to store your biometrics it really doesn't matter, I could strip your finger print off a phone in a few minutes if I really wanted too, and if they were sharing governments only needs the hash, not the original data to match. Fingerprints really shouldn't be considered private considering you leave them everywhere.Unchangeable passwords are as useful as zombie kittens.Welcome to the TINY world of apple incorporating Jailbroken creations!"
"Once you jailbreak, you always jailbreak.Not always true. As much as I love jailbreak, and have always jailbroken every iPhone I've ever had, I decided not to crack my iPhone 6. Purely because there isn't too much that Apple hasn't introduced in their new iOS that I feel I really need from jailbreaking. The only exception being flux. And also, because for me, I always found it got to the point where I had too many useless tweaks installed and forgot to update or modify everything to keep it running smoothly. It was always crashing and respringing so yeah, not necessarily the fault of jailbreak, but just my reasoning for not jailbreaking this time. It was just too much hassle. I just want a simple, slick, phone that does everything I need. Jailbreaking can get out of hand, but once you're out of the honeymoon phase (it took me like a year to realize I don't need 150+ tweaks with most of them being fun/aesthetics), it's the best thing that's happened to an iPhone.  Some really simple overlooked crap can be improved.  "
"Play YouTube in the background while using other apps, VideoPane to have a draggable video while using other apps, cutting off animations completely (this freaked out my friends and family when they used my iPhone.  They were surprised at how snappy it was.  You don't really realize how sluggish stock iPhones can be just because of a simple thing like open/close animations), timed texts, recording your screen without the use of a computer, recording with the toggle flashlight, god damn widgets (I mean come on, how has Apple not implemented these?), **Nightmode**, and a few other tweaks I have installed.  I went from 150+ to just over 15.  I'm glad Apple finally took custom keyboards into the app store, though.  Been using swype since it was released.Only thing I really want to be able to have is unlocked bluetooth. But I turned to Android instead, because I got fed up by Apple's bullshit. Also being able to use my phone as a USB memory without having to install third-party programs on every single god damn computer."
"I do prefer iOS over Android though.Honestly when I jailbreak I find I spend more time tweaking my phone than actually using it. But oh my god f.lux is amazing. Worth jailbreaking just for that.  Hang on, how did Apple take thumbprint recognition from the jailbreak community? The hardware wasn't there. Oh! I thought you meant the text was replaced by the thumbprint glyph! Sorry, my bad. You misinterpreted. The thumbprint isn't the recognition, it's the little Apple pay symbol over where the slide to unlock sign would be if you install the tweak LockGlyphYou mean this [thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMWrtpZlDew)? Frankly, it looks useless to me. It seems to be slower than the standard Touch ID log in. At best it adds a nice visual cue when your thumbprint is recognized, at worst, it misleads me into thinking that my thumbprint is being read when in fact it doesn't recognize my finger at all.  I prefer the standard shake when it doesn't recognize my thumbprint, the feedback is more immediate.The Bundesgerichtshof is not our surpreme court, that would be the Bundesverfassungsgericht. It is however the highest court for all matters that aren't related to the constitution (Grundgesetz).the BGH is the highest national civil court.Now you summoned r/hearthstoneI've got the beast in my sights!> Bundesverfassungsgericht"
"How do you people get anything done with a language like that? I'd be up til 2am typing my morning hellos to everyone.Eh, it's really not that different from the way it's named in the US."
"You have the United States (i.e. federal) Supreme Court, they have the Bundes (=federal) verfassungs (=constitutional) gericht (=court). Both consist of three words."
"We German speakers simply leave out the superfluous spaces between those words, so instead of federal constitutional court, it's rendered as federalconstitutionalcourt.Learn Icelandic."
"glofagjordarmadur is glove maker.It's not like every word of everyday language is ages long."
"Aside from that, the word exactly discribes what the court is about. It really is just 3 words tucked together.My understanding of the German language is that nouns can be combined into a single word. For example, the equivalent court in the US would be called the Unitedstatessupremecourt. "
"Doesn't look so bad when you can break down that uber long word into its constituents. This dude got it."
"If you would translate it literally and stick it together it would be Federalconstitutionalcourt."
"Bundes|Verfassung|Gericht"
"Federal|Constitution|CourtYeah, some people are always commenting about how long German words can be, but usually they're shorter than their (complete) translation because there's no spaces. "
"Bundesverfassungsgericht (24 characters) compared to Federal Constitutional Court (28 characters)Exactly that. And I don't get how its only German that is made fun of for this, many germanic languages do it, I mean look at Finnish and all its endless words full of aaaaaaa... *epajarjestelmallistyttamattomyydellansakaankohan*Except that word doesn't really mean anything and can't be used in any context except in a one that highlights the absurdities of the Finnish language. The syntax is correct but semantics not so much. But it's a fucked up language for sure."
"Source: torilla tavataanepajarjestelmallistyttamattomyydellaansakaankohan*I knew my childhood passion for those spot the difference newspaper cartoons would someday come in handy. Im nitpicking here, but Finnish isn't Germanic, its Uralic. YOU'RE alic.Technically the Bundesverfassungsgericht isn't a supreme court but a constitutional courtThat's right, the Bundesverfassungsgericht is not our supreme court either, that would be the Bundesverfassachtungstuckkuchengericht.But what about the Uberbundesverfassachtungstuckkuchengericht?At this point I can't even tell if you're joking or not.Wow... he is right..."
"[https://de.wikipedia.org/w/Bundesverfassachtungstuckkuchengericht](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb_hqexKkw8)I was skeptical when you posted a wikipedia link as a video at first, but now I'm just amazed by the names of the German court systemTechnically you could replace half the letters in both of those words with random ones and nobody would know the difference.Well if you want to get super technical:"
"The BHG is the supreme court of civil and criminal law (ordinary jurisdiction)."
"The BVerfG is the supreme constitutional court (public law)."
"And there are four supreme courts for special jurisdiction: federal supreme court of: finance, labour, social and administration."
"Relative to each other the BVerfG can overrule any of the other five if the matter touches constitutional rights. Each of the other five only judge cases within their area of the law."
"Still horrendous. The money spent on these arguments could be spent elsewhere. Everyone's being polite but there are some people supporting such petty patent crap who could use a real beating for their self-interested lobbying. But they're not just 'arguments', and while, yes, slide-to-unlock seems petty and small, it extends to a whole plethora of technologies that allow it to function the way it does. Apple is the value of an oil giant after only 8 years of the iPhone existing, and Samsung is basically the back-bone to South Korea's economy. Also the entire population of this planet wants a new smartphone. The question of who can patent what, and how long these patents can be upheld, influences how billions if not trillions of dollars will flow decades into the future.The whole world wants water to drink. A very big chunk of the world population still thinks that apple is only a fruit."

"wait until he discovers that most homeless people have a smartphone too"
"Any first world argument about anything there's always someone talking about less fortunate countries. I don't think those countries are even thinking about patents so it doesn't relate to this. "
"I know the money could be spent helping but the thing is it's their money, they earned it, and they can spend it how they like it.I'm in myanmar atm and today I saw a man living in a tarp on the street watching some birmese show with his kid next to him on a smartphone  with a larger screen than mine. You underestimate how prevalent this technology has gotten,  *everywhere*.Sounds like it would be pretty helpful to be able to google the locations of clean water and food. > Sounds like it would be pretty helpful to be able to google the locations of clean water and food."
"Yes...because poverty has nothing to do with their problem. They have plenty of resources to trade for clean water and food, if only they knew where their local Walmart was /s.Not really. Smartphones are becoming a thing for even impoverished nations. Why put up tons of telephone poles and run cables everywhere when one tower can service 100sq miles? Smartphone popularity is exploding in places like China, India, and many African countries because a basic smartphone can do tons of things while still being pretty damn cheap.There's an article on the NY Times right now, how food, shelter and a smartphone are the new basic necessities for migrant refugees.

"-__->  second world"
"The Second World refers to the former socialist industrial states (formally the Eastern Bloc), mostly the territory and area under the influence of the Soviet Union."
"I don't think that means what you think it means. Additionally, you're using the fallacy of relative privation which doesn't solve anything. what's it called when you learn something new, and see it everywhere now. Because that fallacy thing that was on the front page the other day. EVERYWHERE!!!!https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baader-Meinhof_phenomenonSome of those patents are like patent for having windows in home.Also, even to the pettiest things, Apple need to be seen as prepared to fight for what they think is theirs. Else other companies will stop taking an inch and start taking a mile. Not saying it's right, it's simply the symptom of a broken patent system in dire need of reform.But what I'm trying to say, is that they're not petty at all. To, you maybe some tiny part in your phone is petty, but it's existence in there alone is evidence of an infintely complicated system of factories out there making these 'petty' part. And since you and *billions* of others are willing to pay top-dollar for the newest phone, there is a lot of mouths fed out there by that system. The question of who gets how big pieces of the pie within that system is an infinitely complex one. And that's what the legal system is there for. And it's not broken, it is what it is. The law is like a programming language, so sometimes when these cases pop up it's easy to for non lawyers such as ourselves to misinterpret or deny credibility to the system, but the lawyers know what they're doing, and they are under close observation of other lawyers and law-makers so it's not like there are any shenanigans really going on.  1000 times this. The decisions made in Intellectual Property cases around the world aren't just about the seemingly silly arguments being settled at the time. It's the precedents being set that make huuuge waves in the entire industry. This particular case is idiotic and highlights much that is wrong with the patent system though.  All they did was digitize a locking system that's been around for a really long damn time.  It's like someone trying to patent shirts or orgasms.>patent orgasms"
"There's money to be made there, I'm just not quite sure how.The female orgasm can be tricky...Do Apple and Samsung really owe their success to these silly patents?"
"Amazon famously and ludicrously owned the patent to one-click purchasing - finding an explanation for how this is non-obvious stymies the most imaginative of minds. After all, before the Internet, purchasing took *no clicks*; one click does seem like the obvious goal, should purchasing require a non-zero amount of clicks."
"But I don't buy from Amazon because it takes me a few milliseconds less effort. I buy from them because of their selection, prices, delivery speed, etc. A few extra clicks never changed my decision about anything."
"The same is true of slide-to-unlock. It's incredibly obvious. Mechanical sliding locks existed literally hundreds of years ago. Animating it on a screen is not non-obvious. Apple and Samsung make great products and employ legions of brilliant people; their success is not predicated on ridiculous patents."
"I don't blame them for taking full advantage of the system as it exists; if they hadn't their competitors would have and no one would remember Apple or Samsung or Amazon. "
"But that doesn't mean the system is good.Question for you that I don't think either of us can answer fully:"
"How many competitors** did Amazon hinder by slapping them with a cease and desist letter due to their shit-patent(s)?"
"**competitors in this case does not mean direct competitor as in Walmart or Chapters but instead means anyone with an online shop that might have taken a handful of sales away from Amazon."
"Even if the answer is zero, an argument could still be made that these shit-patents discourage competition.  This is not a measurable ROI but can influence decisions up the management hierarchy."
"Thus the shit-patents need to die a horrible death so that people make better decisions based on real evidence rather than pursuing competition deterrents via legal channels.>lawcase"
"Found the GermanDoes this mean that now the European Patent Office automatically revokes it in all 38 member states?No, patents are unique to jurisdictions.I don't think so. But it should be easy for Samsung (or anyone) to introduce this ruling in any applicable patent case in the EU.No, I think it only applies for German law. This wasn't an European court.Holy shit this is turning into a comment graveyard. And here I came in expecting a reasonable discussion. "
"DAE hate Apple rounded corners lolWhat a silly world we live in where this even happens.  It gets sillier when you realise Apple tried to even own the tap to open because that should be considered  a zero length swipewtf, really?That's how my phone operates now, everytime I tap to open something it flicks to another desktop page.Apple's lawyers argued that in court, they wanted the judge to rule on that as the correct interpretation of the patent.The patent already served its purpose for Apple. Samsung never used it (as far as I know) and now it's hardly used. Today, people use their fingerprint to unlock. The fingerprint thing doesn't work well enough to use it all the time. I wish it did, but I've resorted to sliding and entering my code and so have most people I know. The smallest amount of moisture on either your finger or the scanner itself will prevent it from working.Works 99% of the time for me -\_(tsu)_/-"
"My job requires a long, complex password (no PIN) on our device so Touch ID has been a godsend. I think the slide to unlock was relevant back with the Galaxy S2. Could be wrong tho... But I remember Sony Ericsson Arc and other models had slide to unlock but as far as I know Apple never went after them. WierdI use NFC ring to unlockNFC ring?Http://nfcring.comAm I missing something? This is one of the weakest forms of security. If you lose your phone and ring, you're pretty much fucked if someone picks them up. You can set a secondary unlock mechanism too...  So yeah that plays a big part I guess!But then what's the point? Now that just makes it inconvenient."
"NFC has a lot of great uses. This is not one of them. You obviously have no idea.Finger print unlock was something utilized in Lenovo ThinkPad before being put on a phone.But it was super inaccurate and required you rolling your finger over the scanner sometimes multiple times before it registered. In the amount of time you could do that, you might as well have just typed in your password."
"Say what you want about Apple, but they actually did it right. The fingerprint scanner on the iPhone is super fast.Yeah I remember those. The implementation sucked on the ThinkPad. Apple and Samsung's tech is much faster, more secure and reliable. There's no comparison. and there was a phone before iphone that had a fingerprint scanner.Motorola was headed in the right direction with the Atrix, but the hardware was just not there yet. Also that webtop was a brilliant idea I really thought that was gonna take off and everyone would use similar products by now. I was wrong. And you could convert the laptop dock into a portable monitor and keyboard + trackpad for a PC, games console and even Raspberry Pi.I only ever slide anymore when my fingers are dirty or the TouchID sensor is smudged. Why does everybody keep mentioning fingerprints?"
"I've never used my fingerprint to unlock a phone and never saw anybody else do it either."
"It was always a slide to unlock.I use a PIN."
"Am I so out of touch? No. It's the children who are wrong.For what it's worth, I use a PIN too. The 5th ammendment protects us from turning over knowledge that may be self-incriminating, but doesn't protect biometric data. Basically, during a traffic stop a cop can legally ask you to finger print unlock you phone so they can look in itI slide to unlock to my pin. That is literally how I unlock my 6 99% of the time. the 1% is after a reboot where you have to put your passcode in. You're in the vast minority. wat[deleted]That doesn't mean they are in the majority. Galaxy S6 user here. I don't see others using the fingerprint option nearly as often :("
"I use it every time, though.~~It's because the ones that use it already have their phone unlocked by the time they've settled their eyes on the screen.~~"
"Maybe I misread your comment. While I think my strikethroughed  sentence is correct, it's irrelevant to what you were talking about. "
"There truly a lot of people who don't use the fingerprint scanner on either side of the OS fence just based on ignorance. Fuck, a friend of mine said that they wouldn't ever use a fingerprint scanner because of it being less secure than a regular passcode, which is a load of shit. But all I have are guesses. S/he's in the overwhelming majority. Here in London I have never seen anyone use their thumb print to unlock an iPhone once. And yet I see several hundreds of people unlock their iPhone every day. As I've said to all the others, that doesn't make them the majority. A majority of those you see maybe, but not an overall majority. I think the totality of the population that I've encountered on public transport during my daily commute over an arc of 3 years (?) since fingerprint locking was a thing, plus any number of people I see or meet in public places, in one of the largest cities in the world *and* one of the top cities for iPhone owners, both as raw number and percentage of population, is a statistically significant sample."
"There is potential for it to be confirmation bias, but at this point it would be pretty damned coincidental.How would you see them? They press the button, as they press it the phone unlocks. Any phone that didn't have a passcode would look the same while in use.You can distinctly see people in that moment where they take their phone out of their pocket/bag, whether they hover their finger on the base of the phone or swipe it across the screen. If they do neither, it's because they were using the fingerprint while taking it out.On my 5S the phone is unlocked as I take my finger off the button. There is no delay. I'm not sure how you can be so confident.  Because a screen-wide swiping motion stands out. Both when performed with the hand holding the phone and with the other.The question is why wouldn't you? Instead of entering a PIN I just use my fingerprint...so much easier. New England, only ever see slide and pins here.Not exactly, allot of people I know own iPhones and also use thumbprint. It's pretty cool honestly.Be that as it may, it doesn't mean those that do are in the majority. For some reason it doesn't work well enough for me and many of my coworkers, and my fiance. I'd love to use it 99% of the time, but it's more like half because it generally always fails. Even the slightest bit of moisture will prevent it from working.Or when your finger is even the slightest bit damp, or if the phone has condensation on it..For me it's 80/20, because I'm sweaty. Same here. It really is something that I wouldn't imagine myself using so much before actually using it. The 5s and up have people use it constantly. Fingerprint unlocking is pretty fast with an iPhone.What's also great is that this taught people to lock their phones. I had my previous phones without any password until I got the 5S with the fingerprint sensor.I slide to unlock my AndroidSame. Anyone who uses fingerprint is a fucking moron.I understand the potential security/privacy concerns but honestly life's just too short to sweat the small stuff. Maybe if I was a public figure I'd reevaluate my stance. Just because he thinks that people do x are fucking morons doesn't mean he 'sweats it'."
"For example, right now I'm going to think of an activity to which I would attribute fucking morons to, the catch being that I've never once in my life thought of the activity before or ever 'sweat it' nor do I ever plan to 'sweat it'. "
"OK the activity is: Hammering chunks of drywall into your mouth until you die. "
"Anyone who hammers chunks of drywall into their mouths until they die is a fucking moron. This isn't a longstanding opinion of mine, but I was able to, on the fly, evaluate the activity and deem it for fucking morons. "
"Maybe that's what that guy did.Can you explain why you think that please?he's being a cock but he is right. A finger print is very easily spoofed and offers very poor security. Finger print scanners are just not that good and despite what you see in movies are very rarely the only thing securing an area or device."
"Typically a finger print makes a good username, but a bad password.Spoofing a fingerprint still requires special equipment, sneaking around, and hours of work. Looking over someone's shoulder takes five seconds of pointing your eyes.It really isn't that hard. It'll deter friends and familly from snooping, but if someone wants to get into your phone (say to get at your personal information) a fingerprint is less of an obstacle than a decent PIN.Since when are laser printers special? 1h is more than you need "
"http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/12/politicians-fingerprint-reproduced-using-photos-of-her-hands/So you're saying that if my iPhone was stolen someone with the right knowledge could unlock it somehow?All security is a deterrent. If someone wants into your phone, they will find a way. Same with your house and everything you own. the trick is a level of security that is high enough to deter anyone who is interested in having a crack at whatever you want to protect, while not being so high as to cause unneeded fuss. A fingerprint is fine for keeping out a casual snooper, but if you've got anything that's actually sensitive, I'd be opting for a PIN or password."
"Trivially. "
"http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/12/politicians-fingerprint-reproduced-using-photos-of-her-hands/ "
"Yeah but we *are* talking about phones here, so either way, it's a finger print or a 4 digit passcode. Yeah sure you could use something longer, but no one really wants to pull up a full keyboard and put in a full password every time they unlock their phone. Locking your phone at this point isn't really to secure it against anyone who really wants to get in, it's just to stop your friend from texting your mom or something.Absolutely, it's all relative. I have complex password on my work phone because well... work phone. That said on my personal phone I also have mobile banking apps, and logins to my various accounts. If that got stolen or lost, at the very least I'd be worried about identity theft."
"At the end of the day I can't blame people who want to use a fingerprint, and it's absolutely better than nothing. Just so long as people are aware that it's far less secure than a password, or even a decent pattern lock.Yep. Because what's on my phone is important enough that someone is gonna lift my fingerprints to get into it. "
"Oh wait. That's not the case. And using a fingerprint is super convenient compared to a passcode or password. http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/12/politicians-fingerprint-reproduced-using-photos-of-her-hands/ "
"It is pretty easy to do. "
"Also; http://gizmodo.com/cops-can-make-you-fingerprint-unlock-your-phone-and-th-1653984192Actually its awesome.Yes, because slide to unlock is way more secure."
"Anyone who uses a fingerprint in preference to slide to unlock has a clue.Can't speak towards other devices, but it's handled well on iPhone."
"Your print itself is never stored, only a hash of the print is, and that data never leaves the device."
"It's stored in a separate secure hardware enclave on the device, and to date, no one has been able to hack and retrieve data from that enclave."
"Interesting white paper on iOS security that covers Touch ID, and the 256bit hardware crypto engine iOS devices use if you're actually interested in what's happening when TouchID is used:"
"https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf"
"In any case, it's leagues safer and easier to use than say, a 4 digit pin which most people use if they bother at all."
"Meh, fuck it, long paste incoming:"
"**Secure Enclave**"
"The Secure Enclave is a coprocessor fabricated in the Apple A7 or later A-series processor. It utilizes its own secure boot and personalized software update separate from the application processor. It provides all cryptographic operations for Data Protection key management and maintains the integrity of Data Protection even if the kernel has   been compromised."
"The Secure Enclave uses encrypted memory and includes a hardware random number generator. Its microkernel is based on the L4 family, with modifications by Apple. Communication between the Secure Enclave and the application processor is isolated   to an interrupt-driven mailbox and shared memory data buffers."
"Each Secure Enclave is provisioned during fabrication with its own UID (Unique ID)   that is not accessible to other parts of the system and is not known to Apple. When   the device starts up, an ephemeral key is created, entangled with its UID, and used to encrypt the Secure Enclave's portion of the device's memory space."
"Additionally, data that is saved to the file system by the Secure Enclave is encrypted   with a key entangled with the UID and an anti-replay counter."
"The Secure Enclave is responsible for processing fingerprint data from the Touch ID sensor, determining if there is a match against registered fingerprints, and then enabling access or purchases on behalf of the user. Communication between the processor and the Touch ID sensor takes place over a serial peripheral interface  bus. The processor forwards the data to the Secure Enclave but cannot read it. It's encrypted and authenticated with a session key that is negotiated using the device's shared key that is provisioned for the Touch ID sensor and the Secure Enclave. The session key exchange uses AES key wrapping with both sides providing a random   key that establishes the session key and uses AES-CCM transport encryption."
"**Touch ID**"
"Touch ID is the fingerprint sensing system that makes secure access to the device faster and easier. This technology reads fingerprint data from any angle and learns more about a user's fingerprint over time, with the sensor continuing to expand the fingerprint map as additional overlapping nodes are identified with each use."
"Touch ID makes using a longer, more complex passcode far more practical because users won't have to enter it as frequently. Touch ID also overcomes the inconvenience of a passcode-based lock, not by replacing it but by securely providing access to the device within thoughtful boundaries and time constraints."
"**Touch ID and passcodes**"
"To use Touch ID, users must set up their device so that a passcode is required to unlock it. When Touch ID scans and recognizes an enrolled fingerprint, the device unlocks without asking for the device passcode. The passcode can always be used instead of Touch ID, and it's still required under the following circumstances:"
"* The device has just been turned on or restarted"
"* The device has not been unlocked for more than 48 hours"
"* The device has received a remote lock command"
"* After five unsuccessful attempts to match a fingerprint"
"* When setting up or enrolling new fingers with Touch ID"
"When Touch ID is enabled, the device immediately locks when the Sleep/Wake button is pressed. With passcode-only security, many users set an unlocking grace period to avoid having to enter a passcode each time the device is used. With Touch ID, the device locks every time it goes to sleep, and requires a fingerprint--or optionally the passcode--at every wake."
"Touch ID can be trained to recognize up to five different fingers. With one finger enrolled, the chance of a random match with someone else is 1 in 50,000. However, Touch ID allows only five unsuccessful fingerprint match attempts before the user is required to enter a passcode to obtain access."
"**Touch ID security**"
"The fingerprint sensor is active only when the capacitive steel ring that surrounds the Home button detects the touch of a finger, which triggers the advanced imaging array to scan the finger and send the scan to the Secure Enclave."
"The 88-by-88-pixel, 500-ppi raster scan is temporarily stored in encrypted memory within the Secure Enclave while being vectorized for analysis, and then it's discarded. The analysis utilizes subdermal ridge flow angle mapping, which is a lossy process  that discards minutia data that would be required to reconstruct the user's actual fingerprint. **The resulting map of nodes is stored without any identity information in   an encrypted format that can only be read by the Secure Enclave, and is never sent   to Apple or backed up to iCloud or iTunes.**"
"**How Touch ID unlocks an iOS device**"
"If Touch ID is turned off, when a device locks, the keys for Data Protection class Complete, which are held in the Secure Enclave, are discarded. The files and keychain items in that class are inaccessible until the user unlocks the device by entering his or her passcode."
"With Touch ID turned on, the keys are not discarded when the device locks; instead, they're wrapped with a key that is given to the Touch ID subsystem inside the Secure Enclave. When a user attempts to unlock the device, if Touch ID recognizes the user's fingerprint, it provides the key for unwrapping the Data Protection keys, and the   device is unlocked. This process provides additional protection by requiring the Data Protection and Touch ID subsystems to cooperate in order to unlock the device."
"The keys needed for Touch ID to unlock the device are lost if the device reboots   and are discarded by the Secure Enclave after 48 hours or five failed Touch ID recognition attempts. "
"**Encryption and Data Protection**"
"The secure boot chain, code signing, and runtime process security all help to ensure that only trusted code and apps can run on a device. iOS has additional encryption and data protection features to safeguard user data, even in cases where other parts of the security infrastructure have been compromised (for example, on a device with unauthorized modifications). This provides important benefits for both users and IT administrators, protecting personal and corporate information at all times and providing methods for instant and complete remote wipe in the case of device theft or loss."
"**Hardware security features**"
"On mobile devices, speed and power efficiency are critical. Cryptographic operations   are complex and can introduce performance or battery life problems if not designed and implemented with these priorities in mind."
"Every iOS device has a dedicated AES 256 crypto engine built into the DMA path between the flash storage and main system memory, making file encryption   highly efficient."
"The device's unique ID (UID) and a device group ID (GID) are AES 256-bit keys fused (UID) or compiled (GID) into the application processor and Secure Enclave during manufacturing. No software or firmware can read them directly; they can see only the results of encryption or decryption operations performed by dedicated AES engines implemented in silicon using the UID or GID as a key. Additionally, the Secure Enclave's UID and GID can only be used by the AES engine dedicated to the Secure Enclave. The UIDs are unique to each device and are not recorded by Apple or any of its suppliers. The GIDs are common to all processors in a class of devices (for example, all devices using the Apple A8 processor), and are used for non security-critical tasks such as when delivering system software during installation and restore. Integrating these keys into the silicon helps prevent them from being tampered with or bypassed, or accessed outside the AES engine. The UIDs and GIDs are also not available via JTAG or other debugging interfaces."
"The UID allows data to be cryptographically tied to a particular device. For example, the key hierarchy protecting the file system includes the UID, so if the memory chips are physically moved from one device to another, the files are inaccessible. The UID is not related to any other identifier on the device."
"Apart from the UID and GID, all other cryptographic keys are created by the system's random number generator (RNG) using an algorithm based on CTR_DRBG. System entropy is generated from timing variations during boot, and additionally from interrupt timing once the device has booted. Keys generated inside the Secure Enclave use its true hardware random number generator based on multiple ring oscillators post processed with CTR_DRBG."
"Securely erasing saved keys is just as important as generating them. It's especially challenging to do so on flash storage, where wear-leveling might mean multiple copies of data need to be erased. To address this issue, iOS devices include a feature dedicated to secure data erasure called Effaceable Storage. This feature accesses the underlying storage technology (for example, NAND) to directly address and erase a small number   of blocks at a very low level.Ooh you are so edgy! Yeah, if you're a president or CEO. Otherwise, nobody, and I mean fucking nobody, is going around scanning your coffee cups for fingerprints and replicating them in silicon. You aren't Ethan Hunt. Nobody cares."
"Either way it's far easier to simply look over your shoulder when you type in your password.maybe not insulting everyone will get you a more positive result. "
"while I agree with you that using any kind of fingerprint technology at this stage of the game sounds *really bad* (at least to me it does)"
"I don't think people are going to respond positively by being insulted."
"just a thought.The only reason I don't is because my phone can't. It's a great idea, it's just not worth upgrading over.I use the knock code thing on LG phones, I find it easier than a pass code. Slide to unlock on android is different and in my opinion better. In iOS you have to always slide from the ~~bottom~~ left straight across to the ~~bottom~~ right; in Android you can touch anywhere and slide out in any direction to unlock."
"I'm not a lawyer or anything but I assume Apple just owns their specific implementation."
"Edit: forgot that Apple changed it so you can swipe anywhere LTR. I still like Android implimentation better but it is a step up from the old days especially on a bigger phone like the 6+.Not recently. You've been able to slide left to right anywhere on the screen since iOS 7. "
"Edit: It's not as good as sliding in any direction, but it's definitely better than it used to be. iOS you slide the whole screen anywhere you want.  It hasn't been at the bottom for ages.  Still to the right, but still. I feel that the more accurate term is swipe but that's probably patented. To me, Apple should just get rid of that text on the bottom; really contributes to the minimalistic theme. You can slide left to right anywhere on the iPhone lock screenOh yeah I forgot they changed it. It used to be the lower corner but now it's anywhere. When did that change again? I think it was iOS7..."
"I still like how Android does it because it goes in any direction.I'm not sure how android is but iOS has different actions depending on which direction you swipe, as I detailed in my response to the other guy   [deleted]When did I say you could? Every other direction has a different action though. Wait is that new? Because I have an 5th gen on iOS 8 and it can only swipe LTR. You can pull down the notification bar or pull up the control bar but that's not really part of the lock screen.Camera should work for you. "
"Frequent app will only work in certain locations (Walgreens app at Walgreens, school app while on campus, etc) and you'll see the icon for the app in the bottom left of your screen. >in any direction He said bottom left to bottom right. I clarified that it can be anywhere, as long as it's left to right."
"Swiping up opens control panel. "
"Swiping up from bottom right opens camera. "
"Swiping up from bottom left opens commonly used app for current location"
"Swiping down from top opens notifications and widgets.  I can slide in a number of ways to open up apps instead of just unlocking. Which is more useful to me than when I had an iPhone"
"Yeah, in Lollipop it's swipe up."
"And left-to-right opens the dialer. Right-to-left opens the camera.And it is awesome!! Me too. I've slid to unlock on my Android for 2 years, and half a foreknightSince no one else corrected you... the word you're looking for is fortnight.  (One fortnight is equivalent to 14 days)Foreknight? ForkKnight, deadly enemy to Baron von Knife, wedded to Lady Spoon, father of Sir Spork.It's an uncircumcised knight.Well only half way thoughIf I'm not mistaken the patent was for a symbol being swiped along a pre-defined path, which Apple doesn't even use anymore. Android phones started using a swipe anywhere idea that is really more functional in the end. The competition in the cellphone market pushed that field of technology ages beyond it's time. Compare how big of a breakthrough we considered cordless phones, or the massive zip-up bag for the carphone. These days we carry a computer more powerful than some laptops in our pocket."
"I really feel like pettiness over simple patents like this drastically slowed the growth and innovation of the field, and I'm glad to see there's light at the end of the tunnel.it's effin stupid in the first place.Another win for Germany!Its not the supreme court. Its just the highest civil court.What's a lawcase?A case that makes you Lawl?It's a term of art in Germany.The contested patent thus isn't based on an invention. - *ouch!*Patents are becoming rather unusual and ubiquitous nowadays. What was once meant for the protection of *genuine* **innovations** are now becoming tools to stop simple design ideas from being used by others. "
"You'd think the *slide to unlock* function is a virtual backbone to any touch-screen device.Good. That's a stupid thing to have a patent on.There was a patent on that? That seems really silly. fucking stupid patents for stupid shit... fuck. /rant"
"*edit patents for truly original ideas / designs are good thingsThere's a special place in hell for the technology patent trolls and the companies behind them.Good to see there is still some sense in the world.

It still boggles my mind how you can have patents on basic shapes that Apple clearly did not invent a rectangle with rounded corners.What about rounded corners icons? I hope apple will lose that battle too. It seems there are some Apple shareholders in this thread who are keen on quieting the voice of reason.If you ask me, anything that has a physical world counterpart shouldn't be patentable as a software device.Does that mean android can finally have just 3 dots on the pattern unlock screen?> Judges on Tuesday said that the iPhone maker's method didn't reach a level of sophistication needed to award patent protection."
"Trust me when I say nothing on that phone does."
"Seems like only Americans think that Apple invented everything.No, only Apple Fanbois.Oh good now we won't have to tear down all these medieval castles for infringing on apple's innovation."

I fail to see how slide to unlock it a valid patent.Apple has terrible business practices, and I'm glad to see that they're finally being reigned in. Another win for the consumer, fantastic. Just think they could have sued everyone who every made a dead bolt lock over the last hundred some odd years.Patent trolls should not just lose (obviously!) but also pay all court and defence expenses. Actually they should be indicted for even trying their douchebags moves. They're doing serious harm to our societies in the name of personal greed and the pursuit of personal profit!If I understand correctly, in Germany the losing party has to pay both court costs and the costs of the other side's lawyers, except for some specific instances/courts, like labor court's first instance."
"Apple on got traction in ANY country because they have the backing of the US government. With all the trade deals they can force their US based patents down any country's throat. "
"NOT because their patents(brain farts) are even worth the paper it was printed on. "
"The White house in ALL instances supports Apple's claims and screws foreign companies like Samsung with bans, etc."
"So much so that the US trade minister pleaded that they should keep their businesses in the US, regardless. Patents are such bullshit. How can anyone innovate when they have to worry about every little detail possibly being similar to something someone else, somewhere else, may have possibly created.It annoys me how a company like Apple that doesn't really invent anything sues companies that do over simple designs"
"Edit: I'm getting downvoted which means people think Apple invents things. For those people can you tell me what Apple has invented? That's not including Woz or software I'll admit those are times when Apple invents."
"Edit2: Yes I know that Apple can take existing technologies and combine them in ways that make them accessable to everyone. I don't doubt that Apple is an innovative company but considering that Apple is more of a refining than inventing company they shouldn't be able to sue other companies for huge sums of money.Troll detected.What has Apple invented after Woz then? Not including software I'll admit they have invented software stuff.[deleted]Normally I would agree I couldn't care less that Apple doesn't invent anything. But when they start suing people it annoys me because they haven't invented anything remotely worth suing for a billion dollars. Also you are right I shouldn't have assumed I was being downvoted because people thought Apple invented things although I'm pretty sure that's the case You must get really butt hurt over this then:"

"Like, there were touchscreen phones and touchscreen tablets before the iPhone and iPad, but they kinda sucked."
"I believe that the smartphone and tablet markets today are much bigger now than they were before the iPhone and iPad primarily because Apple showed the industry the general concept of how to get smartphones and tablets right.They invented:"
"Unibody enclosure for laptops + desktops"
"Magsafe connector"
"iPod click wheel"
"Multitouch trackpad for laptops"
"etc...>Edit: I'm getting downvoted"
"Loyal fanboys and shills.  Welcome to reddit.Have no fear brother im here to counter these fan bois have an upvoteSay something bad about Apple and watch em pour in crying, especially if it's true. Or, you know, because it's a straw man argument.  Seriously, there's way more of an anti Apple circle jerk here than there are fanboys and shills.They haven't found this thread or any of the others then.Thing is when you give a company that kind of power of course they are going to use it. Our patent system is flawed and companies are always going to take advantage of that, I would too if I owned a company."
"We need to fix the system, if a loophole exists it will be exploited.dunno why you're getting down voted.. it's true.Probably because this isn't the place for the idiotic Apple hate circle-jerk. So what if Apple hasn't invented anything original lately, they like to reinvent and sometimes it's refreshing from the usual.[removed]/r/technology in a nutshell. "
"You're despicable. I'm simply saying that although Apple hasn't necessarily invented anything all that original, they have found ways to reinvent and implement some things into their devices better than the competition. If you read into it more than that then that's your problem. Wow. You have issues, dude. Chill out. No he didn't. This is usual reaction on idiots.Switching power supply for computers in the Apple II, by Rod Holt, [all this shit](http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2013/10/a-summary-of-apples-latest-inventions-includes-coverage-of-protective-idevice-mechanisms-active-noise-cancellation-more.html), [this thing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-DVI), [all this stuff](http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2013/08/20-apple-inventions-were-published-today-covering-the-advancement-of-oled-displays-ultrasonic-bonding-more.html)..."
"It goes on and on. Stop parroting what some uninformed asshole on YouTube says. At least Mini-/ Micro-DVI I would not call an invention.. they just changed the size/shape of a DVI connector which was invented by pretty much everyone else but not Apple. "
"I am not really knowledgeable enough to really comment on the other stuff though. Apple excels at taking existing technologies, pushing them further and combining them into a usable device. "
"Look at the 5k iMac. A 5k panel starts at $2500 but Apple can sell it with a computer for $1999. "
"Biometrics are super expensive. Or at least they were until Apple put the tech in their iPhone. Yea!  Samsung is the *real* innovator!"
"https://infoa2z.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/apple-iphone-vs-samsung-galaxy-s.jpg"
"They invented the...  uhh... clone tool?That's a Samsung F700. Released 2 months after the iPhone. They were initially released to developers only. It did genuine multitasking which was a real first but otherwise was ultimately a very clunky device."
"Source: me. I worked for Samsung and Sony Ericsson at the time.Of course Apple invents. The iPod with it's clickwheel stormed the portable music player market. iTunes changed how we bought and consumed music. The iPhone was the first phone that had a realistically useable touchscreen, and App Store. The MacBook boasts radically different designs to the rest of the laptop market. (The amount of times I've tripped over my charging cable and magsafe has saved my laptop)."
"Yes, a big part of Apple's success can be attributed to great marketing; and yes they have been slacking in the innovations area recently, but I'm sick to death of people ignorantly stating: Apple doesn't invent anything hurr durr.>Edit: I'm getting downvoted which means people think Apple invents things."
"_Or_ it means that people don't think other companies necessarily invent things any more than Apple does."
"We need to stop using the idiotic definition of the word invent where it means completely and never before thought of solution to a gigantic problem everyone previously thought unsolvable. The term is broader than that, as is the term innovate."
"Whether or not Apple was the absolutely unquestionably first company to _ever_ even think the thought to do the things they did, it stands beyond argument that their choices, products and designs have greatly changed the tech world as we knew it. Before the iPhone, touchscreen smartphones were a different type of product altogether, same with iPad. Whether or not they were _first_, they were definitely the most impactful and, in that sense, innovative."
"It's not enough to just _do_ something new, it has to actually work well and be something that is useful to a lot of people. Apple succeeded better with the useful part than the new part, perhaps, but it still counts, and frankly, I'm sick and tired of the anti-Apple brigade ignoring this. You're free to dislike Apple, as well as its products, but you're not free to rewrite history or Apple's importance in it.Pretty sure my Nokia 3310 had WAP on it, but it wasn't before the original iPhone that I *wanted* an Internet browser on my phone. Apple keeps showing the rest of the world how to correctly implement things, and the rest of the world promptly spends the next few years copying their implementation. Over and over and over. App Store..... Go watch the very first videos of developers talking about the OS and how different was to develop on the iPhone than so Called smartphones at that time. Yes, precisely. Touchscreen phones sucked before the iPhone, and tablets were useless to 99% of people before the iPad. They _existed_, and no one is honestly saying they didn't, but to say that the products that came before were just as good is to grossly distort the truth."
"To me, this belongs within well the term innovate. Apple takes something that doesn't work well, and reworks it into something that works _great_, and even if Apple hasn't literally invented something completely new of which no one has ever seen the likes, Apple has still contributed something and they deserve the right to protect those ideas somehow.the fanboyism in this thread. so yummy.I know it's childish, but it warms my heart to see Apple lose a case.lol if you're using slide to unlock here in 2015"
"/r/technology with its finger on the pulse like usualApple, the biggest patent trollMy day is always better, when something bad happens to Apple. This is good for the world.I've just patented an innovative unlock function for smartphones:"
"> Sphincter ID"
"To unlock the phone you pull your pants down and place the camera next to your arsehole, which is unique for every person. The phone scans your brown starfish to check your identity. Only the correct sphincter will unlock it.Good. Hopefully they lose more cases like this. I'm for patents. I'm against silly patents. That's a silly patent. If only the United States court system was able to realize how stupid some of Apples patents are.  Well, at least other countries are able to provide the assistThats why TPP, TTIP and other trade deals are a thing.I know a good method to eat water melons, I have already registered it as a patent. you have been warned.All the money they waste on litigation....."
"Theoretically, isn't the only reason to patent concepts like this just to get a leg up on competitors and gain more revenue?"
"So if they go out of control and get a ton of patents, wouldn't they just have a monopoly of the market? Which governments (at least in the US) would prevent them from anyway.. so what's the point?"
"Sorry, I'm so so new to this shit, I probably sound like an idiot.. maybe someone can enlighten me.I am going to be a lawspeaker so I can do lawcases!Didn't know you could patent something so broad.Why even patent this ... Let's patent the slide to unlock thing ... the competition will never be able to unlock their phones ahhahahahahah!Apple stays in these stupid ass legal battles wtfYou should only be able to patent methods, not specific things. For example. you shouldn't be able to patent a hammer, but you should be able to patent the unique way you make hammers. If your method happens to be the obvious best, resulting in better hammers, you can sue anyone that uses the same method. For example, apple can patent the way they make the slide to unlock work, however that's the kind of source code you wouldn't make public anyway. Obviously they would never agree with this, because they know themselves that a slide to unlock mechanism would be easy enough to program by anyone with a day's experience in programming. And that's why it also feels ridiculous that these kind of things get patents in the first place. Unfortunately for Apple, most of their 'patents' aren't even worth the paper they're written on. They're just ways of hindering competition. Apple is such a piece of shit company, imo. If you want to innovate then stop patent trolling and start giving your iPhone money to causes that need help and begin to innovate technology that moves us all forward... don't sue everyone everywhere to try and fill your coffers... apple should patent been dickheads cause they do it best[deleted]Kind of like how android is copying the iOS app permissions system that's been in place for years. Funny how that works.both OS's have different features, people want those features. over time those dofferences will become smaller and smaller, that's how you stay competitive, giving the users what they want like custom keyboards in ios 8, or app permissions in android marshmallow. Germany seems to getting a lot of shit right, time to move.Apple patents fucking everything.Apple is a patent troll which is sad."
"They would patent air and sue everyone alive if they could."
"Thanks Germany."
"Das ist gut.If Germany consistently keeps pissing off Scientology and Apple fanboys, we're at least doing something right.Its not only apple but most greedy companies try to patent everything possible http://imgur.com/m24n9Cj Does this mean they lost it worldwide and permanently? This means they lost their EU patents, and, due to trade treaties, the US Patent Office would have a hard case trying to keep that patent valid in the US."
"Essentially, it's invalid in most of the world now, and in the US if you'd sue you'd instantly win, too.It's a law case, not a lawcase.  "
"Lawcase isn't a word in English.Sorry xD"
"I'm German, so I have the tendency to collapse multiple words into one ;PHindsight is 20/20.no wonder i have to slide up on my  android to unlock nowhttps://youtu.be/2LM0CZZ9Uw8Didn't John Moses Browning patent this already in 1908?All y'all complaining that it is ridiculous that 'slide to unlock' can be patented: I agree, but it's not unique to the world of modern technology. In 1779, James Pickard patented the crank mechanism, the same one seen on egg beaters, pencil sharpeners and manually operated car windows. This caused all sorts of problems for James Watt, who had to do some pretty silly things to work around the patent, his sun and planet gears.Boy have we patented it!Yeah. Now you gotta trace this apple logo to unlock <_>Good. Fuck them and fuck all these bullshit tech patents.Remember the days when companies would innovate by producing things that are actually useful, as opposed to just nice / unique looking?"
"If I were an Apple shareholder I'd be pissed off that "
"1) They're wasting money filing useless patents."
"2) They're wasting money defending said patents."
"Hey Apple.  How about you stop wasting money on attorneys and start spending money and time producing computers I actually want to buy again?[deleted]Going to patent breathe to live and see how much cash I can make...Apple is a bratty childFuck an Apple.Does this mean all iPhones will eventually lose the Slide to Unlock mechanic?No, it just means other phone OEMs can make use of the same mechanism on their phones. "
"Although to be honest people have already came up with a lot more ways to unlock phones, so it might be a bit of a moot point now. It is a moot point since phone manufacturers have had this function since before the iPad or iPhone was released. Nobody has stopped using it.Show face - Accepted. "
"Show Iris - Accepted. "

"Make pattern - Accepted. "
"A loss for Apple is a win for meI was especially glad to hear that their attempt to patent the rectangle was denied.Good, shut apple down! God I hate apple.German Surpreme Court?

"If there's anything like a supreme court in Germany then it's the Constitutional Court(s). Apple has, technically, two other instances left: The Federal Constitutional Court, if it can argue (ha!) that our patent laws are unconstitutional, or the European Court of Justice, if it can argue (ha!) that our patent laws aren't up to EU regulations."

"Not really."
"They kept at it for a little bit, but Apple backed off a lot of the lawsuits when Jobs died, and has since been working on implementing a lot of the features that Android has had for a long time (like keyboards, the notification centre, transit direction, a battery saver mode, multi-tasking, split screen multi-tasking, widgets, Ok Google, etc.)."
">Hell, Forstall was forced by Cook to make Apple Maps and ship it in iOS 6 instead of 7, and got kicked out when he pretty much said hey, it wasn't my fault you forced me to get this shit in 6 and not wait a year more."
"Yeah, that was a hilarious fuckup, but there actually was a bit of a technical reason to it."
"Apple wanted more features from Google, but Google wouldn't give it to them without adding some Google branding to the app (placing the Google name in the bottom corner, like in Google Maps on Android), so they had to either accept Google's offer, or go a different route."
"Apple felt that paying TomTom to license their maps and dealing with the integration issues would be easier/better than adding a logo.Greedy cunts, serves them rightAt least they still invented rectangles and rounded corners. Such innovators.When Apple needs to patent simple bullshit, it just illuminates how inferior their product is. I'd be just fine with apple losing every lawsuit from now until the end of time.I'm going to patent screens that light up and the ability to adjust brightness.

Talk about irony!Apple finaly being put in it's place...Good.  Pretty much everything patented these days should have been unpatentable.  Not novel.  Not new.  Many times not even functional."
"My solution is to limit patents to 10 per year (i'd do 5 but i'm being generous).  There aren't even close to 10 inventions per year that are truly new and unique and worthy of a patent.  Sticking a stamp dispenser on the back of a cellphone is not worthy of a patent (let alone the 50 it would get).  The problem is the USPTO has to fund itself, congress won't give it any money, and it's gotten very adept at making billions of dollars per year from patent application fees, patent grant fees, etc.  "
"10 patents a year.  No more.  Granted at the end of each year to the 10 most worthy new inventions.  If you invent a teleportation machine, a room temperature superconductor, or a quantum computer, you can have one patent.  Short of that, no.I don't even use a lock screen, it's only a waste of time.

The worst is when you accidentally summon her. I tell her to shut up frequently. The SO of one of my coworkers works at a place that works with this data. It's got an office in the Seattle area.[Sounds like a decent way to make a living](http://i.imgur.com/7V6ZB.gif)Hey, I remember that! Very weird job.I had a job doing the same thing for XBox. You just tag the parts of speech in order to improve its sentence parsing. And yes, it was through a third party. I remembered that too lol We should all just start sending vulgar messages to whoever is listening to the recordings, through Siri. Not saying that apple don't share data, but holy shit that title was misleading!People do that on crowdsourcing websites. I've done it personally on Amazon Mechanical Turk, which is a site where people post tasks that require collective mental manpower for dimes to a dollar. I got samples of stuff that people said to their phones and had to transcribe them or confirm an existing transcription. I was surprised that I could access those recordings, but didn't think it was a big deal since everything was anonymous. Yep. That post is all the first third of this article talks about.That's what the article says, right?"
"And that's pretty much all it says. You're a better writer.A reddit post about an article about a reddit post. Deja Vu Which was cited in the article itself, this is so meta-recursive.You mean [this thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2wzmmr/everything_youve_ever_said_to_siricortana_has/): *I heard everything from kiddos asking innocent things like Siri, do you like me? to some guy asking Galaxy to lick his butthole. I wish I was kidding.*  "
"EDIT: A lot of butthole licking going on in my inbox. &#3232;_&#3232;if you can't tell from the word Galaxy that OP was referring solely to Samsung's products.So, it includes Android and Windows Phones, but only Apple is being mentioned in the discussion?Except where they said someone mentioned 'siri'.Indirectly.Don't you know you're supposed to lick it before you stick it? Eh... I say shit like that to my phone all the time mostly out of boredom. And I suppose because I'm immature. Bick my lutthole.To be fair, after having tried to use S-voice on a Note 4, I can safely say that Galaxy can lick my butthole, and I'd gladly say it to its face.Galaxy lick my butthole. this phrase pales in comparison to the shit I say. I want some hardcore quotes. Any takers? I feel bad for that person because the only thing I ever ask her is What's the weather for this week? And What's the name of this song?Yeah but who cares? I used to do transcription work of the same kind and there's no identifiable information tied to the sound bites, they're totally anonymous. I'm wondering if that person is now unemployed.Obvious jokes were obvious.  I've seen first hand people fucking with siri trying to get funny responses.  Seriously, that's like the first thing I did when I got siriI would imagine listening to kids say that shit all day would get annoying.Hey Siri, is the guy who reviews these comments a total douchenozzle?Wow that butthole licking thing mightve been me.My first thought when I read that. That was just about the first thing I said to Galaxy when I got my phone. I'm sure *lots* of people have asked Galaxy to lick their butthole. I actually asked it hoping some voice log guy would have to listen to me asking at some point.Yes, he does mean..."
"> FallenMyst, a Reddit user claimed to had recently started a new job with a company called Walk N' Talk Technologies, where job profile requires her to listen voice data collected from Apple, Microsoft users and check for incorrect interpretations."
">I get to listen to sound bites [sic] and rate how the text matches up with what is said in an audio clip and give feedback on what should be improved. Fallenmyst wrote. Guys, I'm telling you, if you've said it to your phone, it's been recorded...and there's a damn good chance a 3rd party is going to hear it,"
"...the thread **quoted in the article itself.** People please read before heading to the comments.Why does it say sound bites [sic] when it's spelled correctly?No idea. Maybe he edited it after the fact.It's funny because that week there was a person of interest episode in which they showed that companies did this. It was supposed to be a big conspiracy or something and then bam: reality!This isn't a conspiracy, it's routine quality control."
"You people are morons.Outsourcing work on better voice recognition is a consipiracy?Holy shit, companies outsource labor?!Hardly a consipracy. I'm willing to bet a trillion dollars that it's in Apple's ToS.But you still post on reddit."
"If you don't think every single one of our reddit posts aren't being datamined, and user data is being sold by reddit to fund this website, then you're naive. "
"There's being good evidence through #modleaks that there's manipulation of questions on askreddit, and that problematic context is curated by mods, in the interest of keeping this site commercial desirable. Pedantry time:  You mean supposed to be a big conspiracy *theory*."
"A conspiracy is just the agreement between parties to act together, usually subversively, whether they commit that act or not. The fact that it happened, and is now public knowledge with empirical evidence, does not mean it is not a conspiracy any more - however it does mean it is no longer just a theory.Almost as if it was all planned...DUN DUN DUNAFAIK on the show the big deal is that they were easily able to connect the recording to a person's name.  That isn't the case here.Oh ffs! Spoilers, dude!But the conspiracy wasn't about people listening to voice searches. It was that the app was changing results and encouraging people to kill them self. That's next week's newsThat poster also didn't answer the question about whether it was possible for him to know who said any of those things.  Presumably it's next to impossible."
"I really don't see the privacy impact if you can't connect the voice to a person's identity."
"Person of interest is really good with things like this, i completely disregarded the show at first but fell in love with the light hearted conspiracy theories and technology combo.  I remember thinking before the whole NSA thing this show is a little ridiculous sometimes, that would never happen"
"But then it happened and I thought oh fucking hell the show is coming trueTo be fair, it's what you consent to whEn you activate Siri. Nobody makes a secret here. I'm personally more astonished that so many people seem unaware."
"Sorry for the split comment Have you tried the edDid not find that on that App that I was using (Redd). Will check out others.It button?I don't think s/he knows about that.I'm really surprised how people were unaware of this being a thing. It is mentioned right in the agreement and you KNOW it only works with an Internet connection. "
"Why is everybody surprised? Because people assume good faith. They shouldn't.people also use free email services from google et al."
"they have been looking at your emails for years. "
"funny how users have always been comfortable with that...To be fair. With email no one is actively checking it. Just scanning through it and flagging keywords for ads. "
"With Siri/S-Voice and (I think?) Google Now - people were claiming that their job was to actually listen to it. To be fair, with Gmail the data gathered is aggregated against your account. Google uses it to target advertising."
"Apple is having a company do QA on completely anonymous sound clips, that are never associated back to you.Good point. "
"So it's a computer that knows who you are Vs. a person that doesn;t? Seems about equal to me.>  Google uses it to target advertising."
"And if there is one thing I hate - it's advertisements that are relevant to me. I mean, I literally have never found a single product that I did not know about because on advertisement. /sDoesn't make sense. People assume the government is out there to track their every move and they don't expect this from a mega corporation? HaI made a program to help testers review our own voice data. It's still in good faith when we do it, and the article makes it look like they're doing what we do."
"Siri uses a Nuance engine. We use Nuance. Microsoft's Cortana uses Nuance. Darn near everyone who does NL speech recognition is using Nuance. A majority of speech recognition in general is done through Nuance. When something is listening to you talk, just assume it's Nuance."
"Nuance needs a lot of tuning to be reasonably accurate. The more things you try to recognize, the worse your recognition accuracy and confidence get. So, naturally, you start paring down or re-weighing your options to improve user experience."
"No one is doing this to get your super secret data, because that's *one gigantic waste of time*. Your interaction with Apple's servers (in Siri's case) or with an automatic phone system (in our case) *is logged to hell and back*. If you want to get analytics out of your customers, you use the machine-friendly, preprocessed text logs.Surprising how many conspiracies are true nowadays.well.. there are conspiracies and there are other... more extreme conspiracies..."
"it doesnt mean that the endless ocean of bullshit conspiracies is even close to being true.Says a JIDF member. still waiting on my pay check from the jewmenati NWO.Conspiracies are a thing of the past with our new connected world.  People talk.  You mean how many conspiracies we prove to be true. Moon landing? Pffft.http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-cias-invention-of-the-conspiracy-theorist-smear-campaign-to-discredit-dissenters/5403876/r/actualconspiracies is a thing. Why is conspiracy in quotes? As though calling something a conspiracy implies that it's not true?Yet, before the truth is exposed by mainstream media, the people sharing those conspiracies get falsely accused and verbally abused, especially on Reddit and with the source policing. You can't just throw everything at the wall, see what sticks, and then shout about being right disregarding all of the times people were wrong.I recently watched the documentary TWA 800 and the US Government did indeed cover up the Navy shooting down accidentaly the 747 bound for France. The documentary featured numerous NTSB personnel who were obstructed by the FBI from doing their jobs or realeasing their findings at the inquiry. Not one witness to the accident was allowed to testify either.Not much of a conspiracy if it's explicitly written in a user agreement contract...Nowadays"
"The true conspiracies of an era become history, and the false ones come to be considered silly. There has been lots of points in history when a conspiracy theory turns out to be true and becomes history."
"Look at various USA interventions in Africa/South America that were super shady and only admitted by the CIA years later (or after undeniable evidence appeared). Look at the corruption in the police force in america back when the mafia were at their peak. I can't think of any other obvious examples but the fact is that history is full of things that were kept secret at the time, so it's not a recent trend that conspiracies are coming true."
"It is quite possible, though, that the internet is giving a voice to people that would otherwise be silenced/ignored, and so more stuff is coming to lightt hat would otherwise take decades to emerge if at allThe internet also just throws every physically possible scenario at the wall and when one pans out they're like ooooooh shit I knew it!  Well...  You also said the President and his cabinet were lizard people so lets just call it a wash."
"> Look at the corruption in the police force in america back when the mafia were at their peak."
"Not just police.  FBI also.  Whitey Bulger is an excellent example of that.Huh, cool."
"Don't know anything about it tbh, was just an example of where the truth was shady. I'll look it up!He bribed the FBI agent in charge of investigating him into feeding him information on FBI operations, and used the information to evade the authorities, amongst other horrible and nefarious things."
"The movie The Departed is loosely based on him.  Except in reality, Whitey infiltrated the FBI, not the Boston police department.  Well, he probably infiltrated BPD too, he just wasn't limited to local law enforcement. But those people are still ridiculed like they were back when the internet did not exist. Even more so now. I don't say that every conspiracy has a right for existance. There is some really retarded things coming from /r/conspiracy, but that doens't mean that everyone there is a conspiratard. Knowing US history as you mentioned, why is it a stretch to consider that what happened during the Arab Srping or Maidan to be CIA plots, when there are things like the Gulf of Tonkin incident or the bringing Sadam Hussein to power?Often they're ridiculed, but often they're not."
"Manning, Snowden and Assange have all had absolutely huge impacts on global politics through the internet's power to give a voice to normal people. The things that they leaked could easily have been discarded as conspiracy nonsense if not for the ability to easily communicate information such that it can't ever be removed/destroyed like physical evidence can."
"The problem with being a 'cinspiracy theorist' is that by definiton that makes you somebody who is gulible. Lots of conpiracy theories have some merit, but a person who believes that a wide range of fringe things are all true is a conspiritard. Imo it's perfectly reasonable to have your suspicions, but places like /r/conspiracy almost encourage a kind of irrational, baseless distrust of all statements from any 'authority' that makes them difficult to take seriously.The term 'conspiracy theorist' has come to equate people who question the official story of all sorts of things (Kennedy assassination, Behghazi) with people who believe the Queen is a lizard. Thus it discredits questioners by lumping them in with fantasists.Well that's why you should never call yourself a conspiracy theorist."
"Like I said, lots of theories have real, but if you doubt EVERYTHING that demonstrates a poor ability to judge truth, not a healthy doubt of the official story."
"I don't put much faith in the honesty of our leaders, but I don't put much faith in their ability either. I think that, in almost every case, what 'questioners' attribute to malice is usually explained by incompetence with a healthy dose of individual greed."
"That said, I think Adam Curtis is pretty much the best documentary-make ever and that his shit is very convincing, which might label me as a conspiracy theorist in some peoples' eyes."
"What's mainstream in some places (for example the entire rich world besides america tends to take the side of the Palestinians in Israel) is often fringe/extremist in another. Adam Curtis documentaries are funded and shown on the BBC in the UK, but the ideas they express would be considered extreme-left propaganda in mcuh of the USA.> Well that's why you should never call yourself a conspiracy theorist."
"Does anyone do this anymore or did they ever?"
"I only hear the term when someone has a problem hearing new information that questions their tightly held assumptions, and they lash out with a bullshit label to deflect that information."
"The term was always about undercutting real criticism and information about how the real world works with petty bickering and obfuscation."
"Sounds like something the Queen lizard would WANT you to think.......I believe the proper title is Her Royal Highness Queen Elizardbeth II but I'm not an expert. Thanks for making this point. As a former mod of r/conspiracy, i understand exactly how valuable original first sources are (and those requesting sources) and at the same time, to really flesh out true conspiracies, there has to be a little bit of room for speculation and then the research of claims... "
"Just like the pedophile ring that was exposed  by a user on r/conspiracy, sometimes speculation and trying to justify claims can open avenues of recearching corruption that wouldnt have been undertaken otherwise..."
"Conspiracy?  It's in the terms of use that you agreed to and everyone must read.  They can also sew your mouth onto another man's butthole. To be fair, in the episode it was the company who made the voice software itself that was also checking the user input and comparing it to how the software transcribed it. It wasn't a third party."
"Also, I've noticed that Person of Interest is surprisingly realistic and sane when it comes to what is possible with technology. Even if it is about artificial intelligences taking over the world. Their attention to technical detail is surprisingly good.When dealing with the maker of the phone or OS, they are first party. Any sort of software company not tied directly to their products, even if their included as a feature, would be third party. I was talking about the Person of Interest episode. Person of Interest is a TV show."
"The episode featured a fictional company that had written voice command software for an unspecified mobile platform. They wrote the voice command software, it was their product, and they had no direct relation to any mobile OS company (beyond writing software for their unnamed platform)."
"The single company featured in the episode both wrote the software, and was listening to user requests to make sure the transcribing matched and the given search results were relevant."
"It had no relation to Apple, Siri, Google, or Google Now (though if I remember correctly, there were some parallels to early Google; I think the company owned a 'popular search engine' with a fictional name, and was a small, rapidly growing company).Because its totally not possible that Apple buys that research right back from the third party right? Because who covers their ass in the age of information...Still completely unrelated. It's a fictional TV show about a fictional company making a fictional product in a fictional Universe. Apple and Google don't even exist.Excuse me,how the hell is it unrelated? We learned a couple weeks ago that third parties go through siri for marketing purposes and now apple has openly admitted to selling it's siri data to third parties."
"So what's to say they don't buy that analyzed data straight back from the third parites?> Excuse me,how the hell is it unrelated?"
"Because my post was specifically talking about a TV show episode, and not any real life situation - no matter how similar some real life situations may be."
"It may be related to the overall topic of this post, but it's unrelated to this comment thread - especially the comment you actually responded to.Wait, that's what that show's about? Color me interested. It does build up somewhat slowly, but you learn more about the characters and what's going on, and their pasts, as the show progresses. Very good show.Go watch it, it's great. just bare with the first season. It's episodic at that point. In season 2 it becomes more serial. Each season the show just gets better and better, season 4 the current one is my favourite by far.An AI that listens to every microphone, watches every camera, and helps the goverment and the main protagonists solve crimes."
"The intro explains it really well."
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfRNWdihRZg"
"You should check out /r/personofinterest for more info."
"I thought it was a another police procedural. Huh. It is for the first season, but i promise you the show becomes breaking bad levelNot solve. _Prevent._ That's one of the most important things.Yeah my badStarring Jim Cavizel as the husky-voiced, elusive, grim crime-fighter ~~Batman~~ John Reese.> Also, I've noticed that Person of Interest is surprisingly realistic and sane when it comes to what is possible with technology. Even if it is about artificial intelligences taking over the world. Their attention to technical detail is surprisingly good."
"They have a surprising track record of being right on the money. Usually the conspiracy they choose to showcase shortly turns out to be true."
"I remember they had an episode about how all the internet feeds in the world are monitored right before PRISM became public.So PoI is being directed by the Illuminati then.> I remember they had an episode about how all the internet feeds in the world are monitored"
"That's kind of the premise of their show. But yeah, it pre-dates PRISM by two years.Yeah but they had an episode that focused specifically on a flashback about how they started a massive program to tap all the internet feeds when the machine was created. One month later PRISM was revealed.Warming you up to the idea then when they release the information you don't really care about it."
"The idea (and practice) have been around for decades, not years, even before the Internet there where government signals intelligence programs that intercepted and monitored all kinds of electronic communication (phone, fax, bank transfers etc) on a grand scale.  See [ECHELON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON)Echelon was old news when the show started or the ill lit magic lantern burning the oil of [Total Information Awareness] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Information_Awareness). "
"One of their quick reference shots of code used by one of the leads for hacking had snippets of Stuxnet in it. I would be extremely surprised if their writers don't have a healthy set of contacts in the tech security sector, they're really good at delivering relevant scenarios.Hm. In one episode, it shows The Machine monitoring a gang's online activity... And in the bottom corner of the screen, it says it's decrypting TOR."
"I wonder if that's accurate/true as well.It kind of is."
"The thing with TOR is that it gives you anonymity but not privacy. That means an exit node can see all the traffic and what it contains but it doesn't know where it is coming from."
"Now... here is where it gets hairy: if you control the majority of the nodes on the network you can use an algorithm that triangulates the source of the traffic. Basically the algorithm plays whack-a-mole until it finds the source but it can only do that if it has control over the majority of the network."
"Who runs the most nodes? The US government."
"It gets even stranger: anyone can run a node. The TOR network doesn't have an allegiance. So every once in a while something really strange happens to the network: it gets flooded with new nodes. Sometimes, someone with a lot of funding floods the network with new nodes."
"This has a few consequences: when the network is flooded the US government can't triangulate anymore. However if this someone is a single entity then they now have triangulation power and they can identify a lot of people on the network."
"Who is this someone? A lot of people suspect China. Other say it's not one entity but whatever corporation needs to use the TOR network at that moment. "
"Whatever the case control of the TOR network boils down to how many nodes you can put on the network. So whoever has the money to keep the most servers running has temporary control."
"This is all very cyberpunk.In that case, you could ban/block nodes in your for configuration....but that would (as you said) be the majority of the network.So we have seed boxes.  Why not TOR boxes?But isn't there a system TOR uses to prevent new nodes from getting all the traffic if there's a flood of them?Complete layman here but how do you make a node?sign up to digitalocean."
"confirm email"
"link credit card"
"create new droplet, $5 per month, debian"

"nano /etc/tor/torrc"
"uncomment the ORPort setting line"
"change the ExitPolicy lines as required to be relay"
"uncomment and set the ContactInfo line to whatever"
"save file with ctrl-O IIRC and exit"
"service tor reload"
"and then just pay your credit card bills. Yes, it's that simple to setup a tor relay.With a Raspberry Pi sitting in my drawer, I will use your simplified instructions to become a relay. I tried reading the documentation but it went over my head.Iirc Snowden said don't use tor.But he uses TAILS, doesn't he? As I understand, all internet traffic on TAILS runs through TOR, unless you use the unsecured browser.He did recommend tails. I wish I could find it, maybe he said don't use only tor Without other measures in place. "
"Technical question, couldn't tor be made much more secure if a billionaire donated a couple billion  worth of nodes? Like wonder who the first philanthropist will be who does something like that.That is fascinating. A real opportunity for a great cyberpunk, corporate conspiracy thriller in that concept. It's a pity Michael Crichton is dead...Excuse me, but William Gibson is alive and well!Neil Stephenson as well> Who runs the most nodes? The US government."
"This is simply not true. At most, the US government possibly owns 5-10% of the tor exit relays. Jacob Appelbaum has talked about this before and debunked it."
">So every once in a while something really strange happens to the network: it gets flooded with new nodes. Sometimes, someone with a lot of funding floods the network with new nodes."
"And you know what happens when the tor network detects 'malicious' nodes (sybil attack)? [they null route them out.](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-relay-early-traffic-confirmation-attack)"
"I have been running a tor relay for the past 9 months and actively encourage others to do so. Please do not speak about things you know nothing about and just type out random 'facts'. Additionally, it's 'tor network' not 'TOR network'.Siri, are you selling my fucking information?"
"Don't curse at me or I'll tell your wife about those searches.The answer would be no. They're paying the third parties to handle parts of the voice recognition, not selling it. I don't think they're selling it. I'm pretty sure they're actually *paying* those third parties to work on it.[She's coming across a lot more suss than that](http://imgur.com/bQSgb4Z)"
"UPDATE: [Now she's just being an asshole about it](http://imgur.com/eH5SGC9)[*FTFY](https://imgur.com/gallery/2woA375/new)She actually says, no comment, nameNo comment, short for I'm guilty but can you prove it?I once asked Siri if she was working with the Feds."
"She told me I don't have to answer that, nameSiri, you have to tell me if you're a cop.Seems like a joke at face value but now...Where admits apparently means clearly states [in the] iOS Software License Agreement.did you read it?Hello, AppleYes, it's clearly stated in 3 point font somewhere in 1.5 million words.  It's right there.Instead of having to read every single user agreement, people should just assume that each user agreement is as bad as legally possible.  That way you only have to know one set of laws instead of each agreement's particulars."
"It's naive to pretend firms aren't soliciting consent for the entirety of what is legally available to them anyway.  Basically, why would you assume any of the stipulations they are allowed to impose aren't present?I doubt people feel that even if the agreement says that Apple *could* do something, that they actually do go ahead and do it. Especially since the agreement is so huge, it almost feels like we are agreeing to allow them to do whatever they want. It doesn't mean they actually *should* on a mass scale.No, not clearly.Human CentiPad.I said this elsewhere:"
"I don't think it's as clear cut that subsidiaries and agents encompass all third parties. Both are legal terms of art and would not cover all third parties. For example, if Apple was sending your Siri data to a local McDonalds, this would clearly not be covered."
"There is a line somewhere. The question is where is that line, and who is receiving the data. You are right. This isn't news. Siri coming back with wikipedia snippets and weather data from yahoo.com for instance should make it abundantly clear they are connecting siri to 3rd parties even if you didn't read the eula. And of course people ask siri to 'lick their butthole' or other non-sense... after it was discovered that there were some easter eggs in the program people are curious as to what the response will be. "
"The problem I have with EULAs is that they are very vague, blanket statements. "
"subsidiaries' and agents' transmission, collection, maintenance, processing, and use of this information, including your voice input and User Data"
"It's one thing to collect the data and process it to help improve the programs grammar or text to voice (which imo should be in-house not 3rd party, but apparently that's not the case). It is something else entirely to send my personal contact information and search history to an advertising agency. This statement seems to allow both. I highly doubt that voice data goes to Wikipedia. That's not what they mean. You aren't really on topic with your last statement. The companies that are listening to you for real have no idea who you are, are not given your identity, and they don't get to send you anything."
"The companies who produce the software to decipher language compare what you did say to what the software interpreted it as. They use this to make the voice software better by focusing on tricky words and phrases. "
"Its the same when people say 'google Sells my info when in reality they don't sell your info, they sell the ability to serve you ads you like. The company pays for x ads to show up on the web pages viewed by people who are more likely to buy. "
"If Apple is selling my metadata with my personal information, like Facebook, that'd be scary news. But it isn't. It's contracting menial voice recognition quality control to another company. The people listening to the voices 1) don't know anything about the person they're listening to and 2) listen to so many they're not going to remember 99% of what they hear. "
"If you want voice recognition, this is how it's done. How else do people think the computer becomes better at recognizing what you're saying? This isn't a scandal, it's a how the sausage is made moment. I'm not sure why it matters that Apple is using contractors. Ah the massive agreement with the length of a small bookYou don't read it? At least tell me you email t to yourself! "
"Seriously, this kind of things are explained to us in black and white. It's partly our fault for not contesting it instead of just not reading and getting pissy when we agreed to something we ended up not liking. /s"
"Edit: Forgot the sarcasm tag. You don't read it? Give me a break, literally no one is reading user agreements because what is says doesn't change the fact you have to accept it to continue using your iPhone/software/whatever. No one's arguing contract legality here, it's a matter of an expectation of privacy and certain moral and ethical grounds we're seeing being further stepped on. LOL it's in the agreement doesn't excuse itI just tell WINE not to display EULAs.If i had to read every single fucking End User Agreement for every widget i bought or every service i signed up for, i wouldn't have any free time and it'd probably cut into my work time too. Regardless, that's your choice. You're essentially signing a contract when you accept the TOS for a product. If you choose not to read that contract, the liability falls on you. "
"RTFM.A guy calculated how long it'd take to read everything a typical person agrees to online. Something like 250 hours per year. and it's written by lawyers. Are you a lawyer? I'm not...Have you tried reading one of those things?  A layperson wouldn't understand 90% of it.  I bet the legalese of some (most) statements would stumble some lawyers too.Its also on the siri wikiipediaAhh, I see the part about sending your speech to third parties, right below the part that allows Apple to turn you into a [HumancentiPad]( https://vimeo.com/24782590).Actually their privacy policy is in plain english on their webpage."
"But I see this has turned into an Apple thing, with barely any mention  of Google or Microsoft."

"I give you my data to improve your service and know me better as a customer, I do not agree to allow whoever happens to be the high bidder next week to have my data."
"That's the big difference. Not the data collection, the data selling without any knowledge, or any of the money, going to the person whose data is getting sold."
"Edit: [google don't do that shit](http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/), check out number 4. Google makes my life awesome by collecting and using my data to serve me better, and they make money by advertising directly to me. I'm fine with that tradeoff, and they're transparent about how they do it. And they don't sell it to unknown potentially untrustworthy third parties.They never said they sell it to a third party. They are actually paying the third party they are sharing the data with. They share it with them so they can verify it's accuracy, they aren't selling it to a company so they can use that data in their marketing. They're doing exactly what you said was ok for them to do, they are just hiring a third party to go through it for them. It still doesn't say it's shared with 3rd parties.I really don't care what apple does with people's data but none of those points you posted say anything about third parties. Go to their page and read the policy, you know, for yourself. "
"Read the part about third parties.  "
"It's not hard.   It says that it is only exposed to third parties to do work, like a contracted call center verifying you. "
"Just read for yourself. It's so incredibly clear and available in every conceivable language.  It's so incredibly clear, yet you pasted a big blurb that had nothing to do with third parties."
"The clarity is palpable.I'm not a lawyer, but the we basically includes third party companies Apple uses to do those things. "
">you agree and consent to Apple's and its subsidiaries' and agents' transmission"
"Basically no big deal.You can't use Siri without first seeing this and turning it on. http://i.imgur.com/ORNVzs0.jpg"
"It very clearly states that your voice recordings will be sent to Apple. I'm not sure how they can be more clear without ending up with a document that hides what they're doing due to its length. Luckily, the EULA is also easily accessible for people who want more details about what's done with the data.huh, that's actually quite nice. Then I have nothing to complain about.[deleted]You can say that about every electronic communications you will ever use.Apple would be the 2nd party, not the 3rd .Nothing about that notice says it will go to third parties.[deleted]It's simply someone they paid to analyze data. The third party does not get to use the data for their own benefit. I don't see a difference, privacy wise, between a third party company handling the hiring, setting up the office, etc or Apple.[deleted]From a privacy perspective I don't see the difference at all.  There's nothing special about Apple employees that makes me think my data would be more secure processed by them than another company they have hired to do the processing.  I expect all data I hand to Apple to be handed off to a third party.  For example, when I ask Siri a question I assume the query is potentially going to any number of back end search engines to attempt to get me a result.  That seems obvious.  Sending my voice to the voice analysis company is not different or special in that regard.[deleted]The single sentence marketing summary of what Siri is that's included in that screenshot is not the terms you're agreeing to.[deleted]Well you do have a point. "
"But the issue here is third parties. The message doesn't state that data is send to third parties. Only to Apple. Isn't sending to a third patty different? As in there is an additional company with this information?It's simply someone they paid to analyze data. The third party does not get to use the data for their own benefit. I don't see a difference, privacy wise, between a third party company handling the hiring, setting up the office, etc or Apple.I just want to know what happened to the first and second patties. the police were called, parties were shut downI want to know what happened to the Dufresnes. In a roadshow museum for dimwits somewhere, labeled probably still edible, what do they make these things out of!?They went to the baker's man.Squidward ate them. they were combined with special sauce, lettuce, pickles, and onions, all on a sesame seed bun.You are the first, and Apple is the second.[deleted]An apple patty sounds gross.Art thou feeling it now Mr. Krabs?Patties, not parties. The original question was Isn't sending to a third ***patty*** different?AW, everybody knows there 'aint no sanity clause.This is a contracted business, hired by Apple to analyze voice data.  A brand new employee decided to break his NDA for Karma, AND he told the name of the company.  Good bye job."
"First, assuming it works like a contracted call center, the company will have a secure connection to Apple.  The data would unlikely ever actually end up on the contracted companies hard drives.  Everything is delivered through a Citrix session over VPN, so it's more of an extension of Apple's network."
"I was in a similar position working for a call center doing tech support in Canada for a US bank.  We would use words like Zee because they were often confused about Zed, and due to the online savings nature of the bank, we had regular calls from the rich and famous.  Also had some IBM analytic tools to look at mobile numbers for millions of customers, all fun stuff but I'd never disclose anything concrete."
"This is an extremely common practice.  When Apple or MS had a large campaign (Lion Release, Windows 8 release), this very same call center in Canada does overflow work during large rollouts."
"The only difference here is some yahoo sang about his job on his first day.Just to clarify - the company was using crowdsourcing to tackle the transcription quality analysis and answer relevancy. Pretty much every major company, including Google, has been doing this with crowdsourced workers for awhile. While some of them may have NDAs, not all will and the user in this case did not. "
"That said, honestly, it really shouldn't be that big of a privacy concern to most people. That vast majority of things said into Siri, Cortana or Google's equivalent are going to be innocuous and no crowdsourced worker will have access to the entirety of your inputs but rather only a random sampling of many user's inputs. Presumably before sending out the voice data and results for analysis, they'd also pre-scrub anything that looks like it may have contained sensitive password or account name information. "
"By and large, crowdsourcing is pretty innocuous and even given direct information about you, the vast majority of the crowd is going to be too pre-occupied just trying to earn a few more cents to do have time to do anything bothersome with it. I used to work at a crowdsourcing vendor and, as a joke, a fellow employee had some people look up my LinkedIn account. He meant to have it be ~5 people so I'd be like Who the heck are these people? but accidentally ran it to about ~200. I woke up to seeing 200 random people from all over the world having visited my profile but no messages or anything from any of them making any further steps to contact me or share my information elsewhere (from what I can tell).>  While some of them may have NDAs, not all will and the user in this case did not."
"Highly unlikely, unless you have a source.  This user posted a paragraph."
"Apple would FOR SURE have it in their contract, and any of their policies obviously grandfather down."
"Just speaking from experience, working for a call center, that contracted to Apple and Microsoft.Go read through the user's posts. It was a HIT offered via a crowdsourcing platform called CrowdFlower (a MechanicalTurk like service). Virtually anyone who wanted to could have gone on to work on it. If Apple had it in their contract, they company they worked with failed to follow through. I think a lot of people would feel alarmed if they knew how much private data is passed between various companies and vendors, and almost all of the security and privacy being contingent on a simple NDA. The industry has been like this forever. I'm not saying it's the best system or even secure, but it's the way things are done. Source: worked for an e-commerce vendor and saw some pretty interesting customer data provided by a big US investment firm. Apple is not a 3rd party[deleted]The agreement is between you and Apple. That's what first second and third party refers to. Your phone is not a party.[Speak for yourself!](http://i.imgur.com/io2a45d.jpg)No apple is the second party. Siri is a computer."
"Don't know why you're defending them so hard.Apple fanboyYou don't have to be a fanboy of something to defend it. It's simply someone they paid to analyze data. The third party does not get to use the data for their own benefit. I don't see a difference, privacy wise, between a third party company handling the hiring, setting up the office, etc or Apple.>The third party does"
"I don't give a damn what a third party gets to use my voice recording for. I don't want them to have it at all. I did **not** agree to allow Apple (a principle party) to share with anyone else. Thank you for that screenshot that confirms that, btw."
"This situation is A: not speculation and B: not what I signed up for. Well that's not what we agreed to based on your screenshot.>  The third party does not get to use the data for their own benefit."
"I don't care. All you big business shills need to realize that just because it's common practice for Apple/Google/Microsoft to share your data with Joe Schmo down the street doesn't make it *right*. "
"And just because someone uses a service by one of these companies does not mean that everyone read *and understood* the ToS, and it's *fucking asinine* to suggest that people do or should. "
"The fact that people *constantly* complain about the way their data is handled is evidence that we need better regulation over these service providers, and *we* need to be deciding what happens with our data, not each company on a case by case basis.  The system needs to change."
"Bu... but you don't understand, apple never violates any of your priv-"
"Shut the fuck up I don't care what you think because you're some guy on the internet. There is plenty of evidence that all of these large companies only respect privacy when they're exposed for not doing so. "
"Rather than making excuses everytime we hear about big business taking advantage of the stupid, why don't we, you know, *do something about it*?."
"But I'm sure most of the people on reddit are so smart though they don't need to worry about accidently using a service on someone elses phone or a phone that was a gift or just some random site on the internet. Do you have any source for accusing Google, in particular? My understanding, and everything I have read, lines up with the idea that  selling data or giving it to 3rd parties is conducive to Google's business model of using the data they collect themselves to provide targeted ads. "
"I'm not saying they don't, I've just never seen anything that suggested they do.If you don't feel what they are doing is reasonable, then you can do something about it, you can opt out of using that feature."
"There are a lot of things they have to cover in their ToS, it's going to be big, should we be forced to read it and acknowledge line by line that we understand?"
"Before we start calling each other fanboys, the following can apply to most tech companies offering voice recognition."
"1. They openly state that they are going to send the voice data to third parties in their ToS."
"2. This is used to improve the service."
"3. They anonymize and encrypt the data (Samsung didn't, which is a separate issue)."
"That sounds reasonable to me.  I understand that some people might not think that's reasonable, and they can opt out of using voice recognition.Personally I think that social networking and AI is a huge paradigm when it comes to human interaction, and currently the way we treat our data is as if it's a commodity. "
"Perhaps we, as a human race, can come together and recognize that we will be using these tools for as long as humanity continues to advance, and rather than letting companies decide on a case by case basis how our data is handled, it should be up to society to decide some basic rules. "
"Rather than having to agree to certain conditions whenever we use a service, all service providers should have to adhere to strict standards and regulation, alleviating the need for such agreements."
"People forget how easy it is to even *accidentally* use a service you haven't agreed to use. Ever used a windows computer at school that you don't own? Has Siri ever recorded your voice from *someone elses* iphone?"
"I just think too many people make excuses for big tech companies to do whatever they want without really thinking about how we could improve things, seeing as plenty of people disagree with the current way of things.I can see the benefits of strict data standards and regulation, I can also see how that could restrict the ability of these companies to create new and more powerful tools relying on your data (tools to benefit you, obviously there is the flip side to that as well)."
"Another way, is to promote the idea that we have the responsibility to be aware of how our data is being used.  No one reads the ToS is such a common excuse (I certainly don't read them).  But there is so much outrage every time one of these stories breaks, that maybe that shouldn't be an excuse anymore.  We have the all the power to inform ourselves, there are privacy policies, terms of service, privacy whitepapers, that are ignored everyday, why doesn't some of the responsibility fall on us?That's irrelevant. A third party is any party other than the original 2. Here it is you and Apple. Source: http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/third-party.htmlSouth Park nailed it. "
"YOU DIDN'T *READ* THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS?! JESUS CHRIST!We should be pushing for a law requiring user agreement summaries at the top, headed by a disclaimer that the exact coverage is described below."
"* We're taking your words n shit"
"* You can't have our money if apple maps fucks something up"
"* If this stops working because you pissed on it, you're out of luck[A third party sort of does that, I believe](https://tosdr.org/)Whenever a topic like this comes up the first place I always turn to is the [iOS Security White Paper](https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide_Oct_2014.pdf). This is an example of Apple giving complete transparency on what your device is doing and is linked to directly from their [Privacy pages](https://www.apple.com/privacy/privacy-built-in/)."
"The full section on Siri (page 40):"
"> By simply talking naturally, users can enlist Siri to send messages, schedule meetings, place phone calls, and more. Siri uses speech recognition, text-to-speech, and a client- server model to respond to a broad range of requests. The tasks that Siri supports have been designed to ensure that only the absolute minimal amount of personal information is utilized and that it is fully protected. "
"> When Siri is turned on, the device creates random identifiers for use with the voice recognition and Siri servers. These identifiers are used only within Siri and are utilized  to improve the service. If Siri is subsequently turned off, the device will generate a new random identifier to be used if Siri is turned back on. "
"> In order to facilitate Siri's features, some of the user's information from the device is sent to the server. This includes information about the music library (song titles, artists, and playlists), the names of Reminders lists, and names and relationships that are defined in Contacts. All communication with the server is over HTTPS. "
"> When a Siri session is initiated, the user's first and last name (from Contacts), along with a rough geographic location, is sent to the server. This is so Siri can respond with the name or answer questions that only need an approximate location, such as those about the weather. "
"> If a more precise location is necessary, for example, to determine the location of nearby movie theaters, the server asks the device to provide a more exact location. This is an example of how, by default, information is sent to the server only when it's strictly necessary to process the user's request. In any event, session information is discarded after 10 minutes of inactivity."
"> The recording of the user's spoken words is sent to Apple's voice recognition server. If the task involves dictation only, the recognized text is sent back to the device. Otherwise, Siri analyzes the text and, if necessary, combines it with information from the profile associated with the device. For example, if the request is send a message to my mom, the relationships and names that were uploaded from Contacts are utilized. The command for the identified action is then sent back to the device to be carried out. "
"> Many Siri functions are accomplished by the device under the direction of the server. For example, if the user asks Siri to read an incoming message, the server simply tells the device to speak the contents of its unread messages. The contents and sender of the message are not sent to the server. "
"> User voice recordings are saved for a six-month period so that the recognition system can utilize them to better understand the user's voice. After six months, another copy is saved, without its identifier, for use by Apple in improving and developing Siri for up to two years. Additionally, some recordings that reference music, sports teams and players, and businesses or points of interest are similarly saved for purposes of improving Siri. "
"> Siri can also be invoked hands-free via voice activation. The voice trigger detection is performed locally on the device. In this mode, Siri is activated only when the incoming audio pattern sufficiently matches the acoustics of the specified trigger phrase. When the trigger is detected, the corresponding audio including the subsequent Siri command is sent to Apple's voice recognition server for further processing, which follows the same rules as other user voice recordings made through Siri. I still don't want to read all that so I'll just assume you're correct.Thanks for letting us know.You're welcome.And where does that say that everything I said is going to be listened to by a minimum wage worker at a third party?Indeed, but many more people probably realize it now than before, since it's on the front page of Reddit.I must have missed the section that mentions everything you say to Siri will be sent to a minimum wage employee at a third party? Am I taking crazy pills? I just barely trust Apple with my private information - why would I trust third parties at all? I've been using iPhone since the 4 came out and I have a 6 now, I'm not an android guy, but you look like a ball-gargling fanboy when you dump this wall of text on us and fail to actually address the point - sharing with third parties. "
"And to everyone saying well of course they're using a third party, duh! - I say: it's not so of course if  not a single Apple privacy policy mentions it. Are they sharing every iCloud email I send to a third party? Is that obvious or not obvious? Stop being shills. You must have missed the part that is in bold in their ToS that says just that.  When a company mentions subsidiaries, agents or any other terms like that, it could be any company in the world for all we know. "
"Most of those relationships are not disclosed, for obvious reasons. I'm sorry where did it mention it in the giant wall of text up above?Those aren't terms of service, are they?  Maybe they should explain everything they do everywhere?Did you not read? The third parties aren't going to get your private information... they're just getting voice recordings.Their privacy policy is very clear about some information being sent to third parties.  You can find it on their website.  Under Disclosure to Third Parties"
">At times Apple may make certain personal information available to strategic partners that work with Apple to provide products and services, or that help Apple market to customers.Again, once you're done gargling balls, admit that the superfluous wall of text above us mentions nothing about sharing Siri voice data to third parties. Sorry, but people defending a completely common and obvious practice are not being shills. Google Now and Cortana and pretty much any device with voice controls and internet connectivity is sending your voice to third parties.I love how people how outraged by these things. There's countless items from popular services that are powered by 3rd parties in some way. Apple, Google and every other company in the work can't and wouldn't provide every single service. "
"Now, if your name and address was sent along with every audio clip, well then I'd understand the outrage, but surely it isn't. This needs to be higher. People cry Privacy invasion as soon as something leaves their device, but Siri can only improve and be useful if things do leave your device."
"And not all of Siri's technology is in-house. Of course 3rd parties are involved, just look at the licensing information on an iPhone. And yet this post rises to the top or /r/all as if Obama admitted to smoke pot."
"I'm convinced people just automatically upvote anything that even looks negative on Apple."
"Just after reading the title. Not reading the article, knowing the context, using their brain or anything. In my experience, reddit is heavily skewed towards android devices. Articles that do well tend to reinforce those views, but articles that do REALLY well tend to expose horrible injustices that apple / NSA / evilCorp do. You don't often see an anti android / google post hit the front page, though plenty do exist. And to be fair *Google's* business model *is* explicitly to collect data. Look at the top comment. Clearly didn't read the article and got up voted, probably by people who didn't read the article.This happens for a few weeks every time apple has a product launch. Hardly an article. More ads than content. To be fair, it says the data gets sent to Apple servers. It doesn't mention explicitly that they get sent to a third party as well.This is the same as the previous revelations that yes, voice recognition is handled by 3rd parties, and our devices do have to send the sound to them. This is a necessary step in the process, and this title is super sensationalist (though blame for that goes to the site being linked). "
"It shouldn't be surprising either that companies who handle voice recognition hire humans to check how good their system is at recognizing voices. How else would you propose they assure quality and try to improve? [deleted]in a world of contracts, not understanding the EULA and then complaining that their rights are gone is idiocy. I have no sympathy for those who are willfully ignorant of what they sign up for because they don't have time to read and understand what privacies they are giving up on by using x device or serviceI think it's unreasonable to expect everyone to have the right technical expertise and time to bury into this stuff. And companies know it. You're probably at an advantage for even knowing this kind of stuff goes on."
"Firefox make it nice and simple. When you install, they ask if you're happy with data collection to improve the browser. Microsoft ask before sending a crash report."
"If it were a person hiding stuff they know people would be unhappy about, you'd probably think they're a bit of a jerk. Companies can be jerks too.The problem us that a lot of these terms we agree on are written down in very lengthy texts that would take forever to read. People don't read them  because they assume that companies don't misuse their trust. If the terms were just writtwn is a way that made them easily readable, then I bet a lot more people would read them.  "
"Also, we live in a time where companies just shit all over people's rights without many of us even knowing it. There need to be some change so that the default settings are never set to abuse private information, like they are today.There was a study of some validity that said it would take 250 hours to read all of our EULAs. Longer for people with a non-legal background (although you would probably get a lot better after the first 100 hrs)."

"Just because we are ignorant of it, it does not mean it would never affect us. That's not hidden at all. There is a concise dialogue telling you exactly what happens when you activate Siri. You have to be in full ignorance mode to not become aware of this.Found the guy that thinks AI is easy.He didn't say it was easy, he said you could set up a programme that tested it internally, rather than using unknowing members of the public."
"In what way does hiring someone to test the device (or rather, forming some voluntary opt-in programme) suddenly make it easy to design the AI?Pffft. It's just a bunch of else or if statements anyway."
"Afternoon job at most, I'd say!Unit testing. I know. This is the most mild invasion of privacy I've ever experienced. Someone heard me ask Siri if the micro machines guy was still alive! Oh no! This isn't the same as the NSA listening to conversations at all. It's more like someone reading my anonymous google search terms, and google search data is public.> How else would you propose they assure quality and try to improve? "
"Two ways:"
"1. When user corrects themselves manually (via keyboard) - send which word was corrected as a learning process. On most occasions I'd assume changing word after voice to text transcription means voice recognition failed partially."
"2. For situations where input field is not present, give frown icon (or text Report voice recognition or whatever). Create an interface that allows user to report specifics of what went wrong in a pre-defined way (so that no human has to process the report) - for example pick word and suggest different word similar to web UI for Google Translator.Haha now you're making users do work. That's one way to piss them off, and a good one, too."
"No, let's not do any of that. User has to correct wrong words anyway. Second point can be done nicely so that user is happy enough to help. I don't quite get your point... In both of the situations that you mentioned someone would still need to actually review  your recording to make sure you arent fucking with the system or to make sure that YOU are actually saying the appropriate word.The sheer amount of users solves anybody trying to mess with the system."
"It's nothing new. Those swipe or other predictive keyboards learn same way. >sheer amount of users solves"

The revelation that someone out there has to decipher what they say and interacts with their privacy destroys that illusion. Why is it a third party? Why is Apple not hiring people to assure quality of their product?Because Apple don't make the software or run the systems.  There's widespread speculation that Siri voice recognition is handled by the same company that does the VR from Samsung's smart TV.Nuance is behind the Siri voice recognition.They did hire people. They hired a third party.I prefer the third party setup simply because of how the trust is set up. We trust Apple with our voice data (ie. to aggregate a random sample of it into generic statistical groups) Apple trusts the third party with statistical data. If we were simply trusting Apple with the data and we were trusting them alone there is no motivation for Apple to aggregate the data for analysis in such a way to make the data anonymous, in fact that would arguably reduce the efficacy of analysis since you have less data to analyze.Apple doesn't own the speech recognition technology. The voice data is sent to Nuance (leader in voice recognition). Nuance processes the voice and reviews samples for adaptation or learning to improve the system."

I assume it was all based from people's search history or something but the terms were usually relevant and never gave anything away or had personal details attached.It's algorithms all the way down.Cupcakes and strippersCupcakes and Lollipops.After reading the article, I asked Siri to lick my butthole several times.Follow it up with a 'thank you'.when will people realise that everything you do on smartphones or practically any web device is simply not private. and let's face it, something like siri simply has to be monitored if only for the betterment of its accuracy and comprehension, marketing aspects of that information aside.That's not the case with android.I'll take your word on that (only ever fully read an EULA once, and that was some time ago) and long may it continue if that's the case but there's nothing stopping them from changing thier policies in the future much how Facebook did (with all the repercussions that came with it) and if no-one does read it and just accepts that android is always on their side then we as consumers might get caught out one day."
"my personal policy has always been, any 3rd party service I use, my data most likely will not be private. any content I create on or using said service, I will most likely not have any legal right over. "
"I don't really have any problems after accepting that.Apple, Google, Microsoft, etc. go check their privacy policies, they are very clear about what they are doing.  Being comfortable or uncomfortable about it is fine, but simply claiming that it's not happening is ridiculous.That is very much the case with android. In he same thread where the guy told about listening to Siri he said he also had listened to Cortana and Now. Besides, information is stored on american servers. That information will be given to a bunch of agencies as soon as they mention it. Your information is not your own, and it is definitely not private.[deleted][deleted]Well then I assume you either aren't high up enough, or you're breaking a NDA by spilling some beans.And how exactly would you be able to see the flickering of a light when most videos are still lower in a framerate than the electrical grid hertz? Down to being able to specify down to a block? This is so far off reality, I can't belive you are serious. I think that might be just a bit exaggeratedThe former sounds reasonable as frequency of AC electricity changes based on load. But the latter is simply physically impossible due to scattering of light and interference (particles in atmosphere)Someone has a reasonable point down thread a bit about the former. "

">And how exactly would you be able to see the flickering of a light when most videos are still lower in a framerate than the electrical grid hertz? Down to being able to specify down to a block? This is so far off reality, I can't belive you are serious.Agreed, no way they can see a dime from space.Yes, yes...we've heard the mantra...*but everybody ELSE is doing it.*"
"It's called deflection. This thread is about Apple."
"(I use this comment so many times, I just cut and paste it anymore.)doesn't make it less relevant to the conversation. I mean shit, if we stayed specific to apple with our responses then all this thread could ever be is oh no, apple are sharing data with 3rd parties that users somehow believed was private data even though in the EULA it clearly states that it will be shared, the users simply didn't give a shit enough to read it and now some article is talking about it like its a big deal. Really, the way any service is set up means you have no privacy. And the fourth amendment and subsequent changes to it (Reasonable expectation of privacy) only go so far to protect it. "
"It is actually very unreasonable to expect your email, searches, etc. to be considered private when you are sending so much information to second and third parties. "
"One of two things needs to happen to ensure privacy for people"
"The first is that there is significant legal change designed to protect your privacy online, the issue is that this runs into conflicts in many areas, and would be a kind of protect us from ourselves measure which is not really what is often done."
"The second is that people start independently taking measures to better secure their information, encryption and the like. To which I say lmfao yeh ok.I use Android with XPrivacy. Apps don't have permission to get my information. It has randomized data too for the hell of it.power to you!Agree.   But my issue is that Tim Cook acts like Apple is Holier-than-thou on privacy.   That's because this title is clickbait bullshit. Apple's security white paper shows how transparent they are. You people will upvote anything remotely anti-Apple."
"http://redd.it/2yvjf5Which they are, somewhat. He doesn't claim that Siri data isn't analyzed by humans, though.What evidence do we have that Apple is Holier-than-thou on privacy?    Because they say they are?   Honestly, I trust Google more than Apple.   I feel Google knows security far better than Apple.   And why is that? Because Apple is for the newbz who don't know better. Use superior gear like the far more intelligent being that I am? m'lady."
"It's simple. Follow the money. Google makes the vast majority of money from collecting information and selling ads. Apple makes the majority from hardware sales, everything else like cloud is just to increase the value of the hardware they sell. They have no incentive to fuck with that and ire customers.yeah that kind of jackassery is just lowThey are pretty good. Unlike Google, they don't sell the information to third parties for marketing purposes. They also provide everyone encryption that is so well-implemented that it frustrates law enforcement. Apple does behave in a privacy-sensitive way. It's just that the climate being what it is, especially in tech, them doing better than the other guys is not that meaningful at least for a security researcher who would really prefer everything be perfect.I don't believe Google has ever sold information to third parties.   Maybe I am wrong but I spend a lot of time reading, surfing and have not heard this from a reliable source. "
"Could you provide a source?"
"On encryption it was Google that elevated sites in search that use SSL.   There are other examples where Google  has pushed encryption.   So not exactly sure where you are going there."
"BTW, with the new service workers it has been Google that has required SSL.   Will not allow otherwise.  > I don't believe Google has ever sold information to third parties."
"Er, it's literally their business model. We're being butthurt about anonymized data being used for purposes outside of the intended purpose of providing that data? In Google's case, making a search query or receiving an email. In Siri's case, making a vocal search query. You get my point. These all use your data for a secondary function - improving targeted marketing, improving voice recognition software, yada yada - potentially by a third party. "
"And that's literally Google's business model. They collect a lot of data and use it in ways that don't fulfil the original goal of what you provided it for. "
"I don't think that's a huge issue, but some do.Ok, if it is their business model then I would think it would be easy to find a source.   I have searched both Google and then tried Bing.   "
"In neither place can I find an example of Google selling personal data to any company.   Zero.   I do find tons of examples of people saying this on sites like Reddit.   But zero examples of it actually happening."
"I find this very frustrating that people say something that apparently is not true over and over again.   Then people repeat it like it is true."
"Does it bother you to repeat something that there is no source of being true?Because it's so blatantly obvious. "
"Example: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Flu_Trends"
"Google Flu Trends aggregates searches (*your personal data*) for analysis by Google. Through other programs, this analysis is conducted by third parties."
"It's not like there's a file with your name on it in Silicon Valley. That's not what anyone's alleging. But when you make a search, Google and Apple see the content of that search and are able to sell the content in aggregate for analysis by Search Engine Optimization companies/people doing analytics work/etc. "
"Edit: for people downvoting, please explain.I honestly want to see how this works.    My wife is a big Google user.   Can you show me how can I download her personal information from Google for a fee?"
"There are interesting sites on the Internet where I can find all kinds of info about someone for a fee.   But I don't believe any of these are available from Google.   Where is this type of service from Google?"
"Your link above is not personal data but aggregated search data.   Very different from personal information. Google does not sell any information to third parties. If they did, their model would quickly break down. If advertisers had all their targeting data, they wouldn't need to go back to Google. What Google does sell is a service to advertisers where they will serve the ads to the target demographic. The difference is, one trusted company having data, and using it in ways that are clearly defined in their (plain English) privacy policy, and who knows how many companies having your data and using it for who knows what.They don't sell it, they sell the result of it."
"Pay us x dollars for targeting young males in Ontario between the ages if 18-24 is not the same as Pay us x dollars and we will give you Nupogodi's digits."
"Ya see?Actually, they do have a pretty good track record as far as privacy goes.I don't mean to be combative but what do you base this on?[deleted]http://redd.it/2yvjf5"
"Here you go.That's a weird expectation.  There's a lot of successful companies that aren't very transparent.  Granted, most of them don't handle as much personal knowledge of us, but still it's not like it's outside the norm.They can't link what you say or do on Siri to you.  It's all done by random identifiers that change often.  It seems like this is less of a privacy thing, and more of a way of attempting to improve Siri.I think that's called trying to sell a brand."
"A dont-give-a-fuck-about-privacy attitude probably won't sell more iPhones.Can you provide some examples?Well... yeah, no shit sherlock. This was verified a bunch of times when you activated it and was well publicized for almost all the voice-recognition services like Google, Samsung, Microsoft etc."
"As long as it's anonymized beforehand and not tied into user info, I honestly can't care less. This is what I thought the problem was about.  If everything is anonymous does it matter?  Also can they find out who the person was after the fact?  If they can that's kinda of fucked up.No. It's completely disconnected and anonymized. The necessary sample sizes are enormous. People think you make this talk to a computer thing work with magic....Okay, so what is it we're upset about with this? Yes, it says right there when you agree to allow it. It's going to be heard by someone else for the sake of what amounts to an audio captcha. Do your words match what Siri put in? I don't get what the problem is here. Anyone care to explain?There is no problem. The problem is that /r/technology is slowly being overrun by conspiracy theorists and other tinfoil enthusiasts. Was there ever any doubt? No; it says so in the terms of use.I'm sure Google is doing more and worse, yet no one care. Color me shocked.The joke's on you: the only questions in ask Siri are sexual.Now I regret asking it the best places to hide a body...Shit post, OP. Apple didn't admit anything, unless you mean in its terms and conditions, in which case it isn't news."
"Also, your article uses *another redditor* as its primary source, not Apple.I hate Apple as much as the next guy, but that's literally the only way to improve voice command programs."
"I'm 99% sure that every single thing that is voice-activated and connected to the internet sends the audio to some other company for analysis."
"That's the only way you can find out if you're picking up what people are saying correctly, by having an actual person listen to the words, read the text that was interpreted, and then say good or bad.I have done work on Amazon Mechanical Turk where I had to check transcriptions from voice commands for cell phones. Specifically Samsung Galaxy phones, but I imagine Siri was in there somewhere as well.From the article: "
"Apple's iOS Software License Agreement also clearly states that, By using Siri or Dictation, you agree and consent to Apple's and its subsidiaries' and agents' transmission, collection, maintenance, processing, and use of this information, including your voice input and User Data, to provide and improve Siri, Dictation, and dictation functionality in other Apple products and services."
"What's the controversy that the title is trying to suggest?"
"Am I the only one thinking that the violation of a NDA - by who posted on Reddit about his/her Siri reviewing job - is much worse?Yes?"
"I actually didn't know ~~it~~ *voice data* was being shared with 3rd parties. I fully expected Apple to use it internally (like Google I presume), not contract it out."
"EDIT: by it, above, I'm referring to **voice data**, not the transcribed query. Of course Apple uses third party APIs using information obtained from your query, that's hardly surprising. What wasn't obvious to me is that **voice data** is also being shared to third parties.So what you're saying is you expect things contrary to the user agreement you elected not to read before agreeing to? Apple has recently made a strong push in marketing themselves as the more-private alternative.  Tim Cook [posted this](https://www.apple.com/privacy/):"
">We believe in telling you up front exactly what's going to happen to your personal information and asking for your permission before you share it with us. And if you change your mind later, we make it easy to stop sharing with us. "
"I'm not an iOS user but this would be a compelling reason to switch.  How up front is Siri regarding sending data and is the Siri function opt-in or opt-out on a new device?"
"You can't even use voice dictation for text input from the keyboard without agreeing to a pop-up which informs you that your voice will be sent to Apple, with a button included in case you'd like to learn more. The same message is in preferences if you'd like to turn on siri."
"My understanding is that technically ALL of the voice data goes to Apple, to their servers for the processing. And the message is upfront about that."
"Sending to 3rd parties sounds scarier without knowing more about it. They probably should mention that more clearly but I don't think they're engaging in any insecure practice. Random anonymous clips of voice data are sent out to improve accuracy. Big deal.Google is using your data with third parties in the same way Siri does. Seriously read what Apple is actually admitting here. "
"If you ask Google Now about the weather Google passes that request to Weather Underground, Inc."
"Just like when you ask Siri for restaurants nearby it passes that request to Yelp. "
"Seriously what's the problem here? I was hoping /r/technology had a better understanding on how these services work. This is getting ridiculous. Google uses it internally and contracts it out just like Apple. Do you have a source that corroborates your claim? AFAIK Google doesn't share your **voice data** (which is what I found surprising). Yeah... but Google!!duh..."
"seriously, how do you people not know this already? so does samsung TVs, google, and anything else that interacts with your voice + internet"
"it's called [Machine Learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) and requires collected data to become more accurate"
"that's why when people said i'm never buying a samsung TV because of this, I just called them an idiot because they probably own an android or iphoneNot to defend Apple, but where in that article did Apple admit anything? Looks like this unknown publication took the Reddit guy at his word, wrote an article and then decided to look through the SLA to find that part. "
"Again, who was the spokes-person that admitted this to the reporter of this story? Where is this story on Ars, or Verge, or CNET? I mean, wouldn't this be a HUGE story?While I love a good old fashioned Apple bashing circle jerk.  It annoys me when people think that everything they do is private.  Every time you go to the grocery store, best buy, gamestop and use an account to get the discounts they are building a profile on you.  And profiles on everyone else that shops there.  Same thing goes with this kind of tech.  "
"They are trying to tailor their product for the consumer.  grocery stores are finding out what products are best to keep on hand, and what coupons to send you to come back.  Amazon.com recommends products that are similar to what you bought/looked at earlier."
"It amazes me how people who have no idea about computer programming pretend that something can be so easy.  I know too many people that try to interject a Well they should just program something to do that for them.  Hey if it was that fucking easy you would program your own cell phone and not be using Apple's.Problem with this argument....."
"When you go to a store, you need to sign up for those customer loyalty programs.  In exchange for selling your info, you get a discount."
"With apple, I've purchased the phone in exchange for money.  The business transaction is concluded at that point.  What apple is doing is re-monetizing a completed transaction when the other side isnt deriving any benefit from - which is why its wrongBut you are deriving benefit from it. Apple is using it to improve its voice recognition quality.You're benefitting by using siri. Except that part where you agreed to their terms and conditions.>Problem with this argument....."
"You then go on to make an incorrect analogy. Good try. Someone doesnt know what the word analogy means.....when exactly did literacy become a lost art?You don't have a clue what you're talking about because those two things aren't even remotely the same.Then don't use Siri. Don't use dictation. Don't agree to the terms that they clearly state for using these services. "
"Your analogy only works if, upon walking into the store, you're demanded to either make a store account or leave. That isn't what's happening here. An iPhone is perfectly usable (Android fans will disagree) without the voice commands and dictation. But this means you've bought something that you cant use, as you bought the phone, the o/s, etc"
"For your argument to be valid, siri would not have come preinstalled on the phone.  Only if a user installing it post purchase and entering a new agreement would your argument be true.  While Siri is included and part of the cost of the phone, it's not enabled without manually turning it on, on a screen which notifies you that your voice recordings and other data will be sent to Apple."
"Others have already stated that Apple is not selling your information or building a profile on you. They're simply figuring out how to improve their algorithms to understand speech."
"Also, stores often track customers through credit cards, without any signup required. When you buy a banana at Target one day and a TV the next, using the same credit card, Target knows that the same customer bought those items, the day/times, they bought them, how much they paid, etc. This is tracked and used in the same way as what has already been mentioned with customer loyalty programs. A couple of things here....."
"> t's not enabled without manually turning it on, on a screen which notifies you that your voice recordings and other data will be sent to Apple."
"What you are saying is that you are being charged for software that has been disabled and yet.....you're okay with this?"
"Secondly, while the article mentions that one of the third partie**S** is using that info to make siri better, how do you think this is funded?  From the cost of the phone - maybe but handsets are already discounted.  More than likely, its from selling that information to the other parties not mentioned - remember - its plural."
"Thirdly, in regards to credit cards, yes, the store can retain this information, but there is the option of paying with cash, and most consumers will pay with cash only.  Furthermore, this information is quite shallow - in that it doesnt know your age/gender/where you go after you leave the store, etc."
"Yes, I'm fine with it. I'm also paying for the front facing camera which I never use. I realize that the cost of it is negligible and lots of other people do want it on their phone."
"Yes, it's clearly funded by the cost of the phone and maybe future benefits of having better voice recognition. iPhones are not subsidized by Apple, they make a very healthy profit on them. They are often subsidized by the carriers who mostly remake that money through monthly service  fees and have nothing to do with this.You can use the phone without Siri. You don't have to use either Siri or dictation in order for your phone to function. I never use dictation and only use Siri when I want to google something that isn't hard for it to understand, as well as set a timer. But I can do those things easily without using Siri. So if you don't want to use Siri or dictation, it's very easy to avoid them. Step 1:  Read what I said"
"Step 2:  Notice where I say siri was sold with the phone - by default, this means you've already paid for siri and all rights associated for fair usage of said product"
"Step 3:  explain how apple can charge the customer twice - once when they purchased siri, and twice when they sell the information from the usage of siri"
"Yeah, I don't have patience for this right now. Okay, believe what you want. Apple is a big bad company who wants to give all your deepest darkest google searches to shady companies while taking it in the ass from the NSA. Sound good? It's not being monetized. Apple buys a service to check pronunciation for Siri. Please reread article - states clearly multiple parties involved - only one party was mentioned.> Walk N' Talk Technologies and other similar companies work with Apple and Microsoft to help them improve the accuracy of their intelligent personal assistant applications, Siri, Dictation and Cortana."
"Not only that but the article is extremely poor quality and only cites a reddit post made two weeks ago on this very subreddit. The title itself should be enough to turn you away as Apple has been freely acknowledging for a long time that siri's data is used by 3rd parties to enhance siri's accuracy. [deleted]I'm sorry, what part of this system are they monetising?Misleading news article title. Apple is not sharing your voice data with third parties for a profit. They are contracting third parties to listen to your voice data in an effort to make voice recognition better. Google is doing it too. You agreed to let them do this when you agreed to their legal waivers. The third party companies do not have any way to tie it back to you, they're just listening in to what you say and noting when the software gets things wrong so that engineers know what needs to be improved.Lawyer here:"
"I'm not convinced that agreeing to allow your voice data to be transmitted to to Apple's subsidiaries and agents encompasses third parties. Agent and subsidiary are both legal terms of art. Apple also used the phrase third-parties elsewhere in the TOS, which suggests a distinction in meaning. "
"That said, this article is pretty terrible. Where does Apple admit anything? They talk about the reddit thread, and the TOS, but there's no new information. Did I miss something?I really don't understand the issue here.  The way this technology works REQUIRES them to send your voice recording to a server."
"Your phone does not have the capability of recognizing and transcribing your voice, that all happens on a server farm."
"Apple didn't create Siri, they bought it and it's based on yet another company's back end technology.  It's a collaboration."
"I don't care if people listen to what I say into a speech recognition system as long as it's anonymized.  I don't even care if they save it for all eternity, though I can't imagine anyone would...that's just a huge waste of disk space.Admits? It tells you up front.I hope some poor schmuck listens to my conversations with Siri. It's 85%  Siri go fuck yourself you fucking cunt because it's incapable of going what I want. Also, Siri, why are you such a twat?We need a misleading title tag.Well, third parties know that I have anger problems when I'm misunderstood, I guess. Who is honestly surprised by this 'reveal' of information.Why is there never an outcry about Amazon Echo?I would't have a problem with  them improving my SiriAny1 here surprised? No.Fuck Apple, fuck them all."
"*When is the next Apple product coming out? Can't wait to get it!!!!!*Oh good. Now 3rd parties will know I set timers with Siri to remind me to turn off my pool topoff water."
"I for one am extremely surprised at this news "
"-No oneReally? Apple sharing private data? Big surprise...we should curse at Siri more often.South Park seems to have called this shit.Siri *is* a third party. The voice recognition is completely 3rd party technology. They were open about this and it should come at no surprise to the informed.I've never had an iPhone but have an iPad. I think I tried siri a couple of times. Each time she said she had to look it up on the internet. Hell, I can do that. I haven't used siri since."
"Frankly - I find her annoying.It would seem that very few people understand the concept of cloud based services. "
"They aren't 'sharing' or 'violating your privacy' or anything like that. The Siri service collects the audio request, the audio is streamed to a cloud based Speech Rec and Natural Language Understanding service that is provided by a third party, widely believe to be Nuance in this case. The third party parses the audio, turns it into text (based upon these two cloud based functions) and returns the output to the Siri service, which shows it on your screen. "
"That's all."
"There's nothing sinister at play here. The same type of cloud based transactions are occurring ALL THE TIME with so many other services that you consume every day. People need to wake the fuck up and realize that every piece of information they offer to a corporation is being sold to many, many third parties."
"Goddamn sheep.45 year old software engineer here. If you kids think your data is safe or have any expectation of privacy, you are idiots. You give up privacy dozens of ways. Every time you buy anything anywhere. "
"Soon you whippersnappers post a TIL companies track my every move in covert ways. Shit, that's been true since even before the invention of the computer. Knowing what consumers want and care about is not just useful to marketers, it's useful to governments. You most likely don't want to admit it, but we all indirectly benefit from this data - Better products, a pizza place (that you like) closer to your house, etc. "
"If you want privacy get off the grid, get a cabin in the woods running on solar power, pay cash for everything and get rid of all electronic devices and identification (you know they have NFC in those, right?)."
"Stop getting your panties in a twist over nothing. Google, Mocrosoft and literally every company (with the resources) does this. You at live in a modern world, not the fucking 1800's."
"[deleted]I'm not saying there is any guaranteed benefit. I'm not even saying that I like it either. I'm just saying your data has and will be bought and sold of you like it or not. If you don't like it, become an activist - but if your expectation is that you will only buy games or software that doesn't spy on you, you're going to have a very tough time with that. Come to terms with the reality of the modern world, fight it, or become a Luddite. Or you can bitch about it but not really do anything about it, which is pretty much what everyone does.They need to let us opt out of this. I don't know if it's still true, but google voice had/has a feature on voicemails asking if you want to submit them to help make the program better.No need to opt out. Just stop using it."
"The data has to be sent to Apple to be processed and to give you an answer. Randomized samples of data have to be reviewed by humans to improve the accuracy and to check things are working as expected. It's not unusual to farm this kind of work out to third-party companies in countries like the Philippines or India. "
"This isn't a big secret. It's just a sensationalised story to grab the attention of those who don't understand technology."
"It's not like they're selling your voice recordings to be used in jerk-off booths. I hope they enjoy my constant requests to set 14 minute timers for pizza cause that's all I ever use it for. Is anyone surprised?By looking at the comments, this isn't a new thing in the least. It's been stated in multiple other places. The issue I have with this is the confusion of agreement forms. The average consumer will not read the full document and even if they do it won't be fully understood because of vague statements. These things really need a TL; DR form for the consumer (that is not misleading)Is anyone surprised by this? All your personal data is for sale. Always.Jokes on you, I'm too poor for Apple products!I use iPhone because Google steals all your data. "
"Well, there goes that fanboy argument. Why would anyone expect differently at this point? I just assume that Costco, ClearChannel, IBM, Wal-Mart, all of them, have a dense profile on me and my interests and have decided whether or not I'm a viable target for their marketing. The don't give your voice away with your name attached, this is done for quality control reasons to ensure that their system is doing what it is supposed to.Just to make sure I understand it right, basically someone in an office somewhere listens to an audio clip and has the text for what siri et al thought you said and reports on how accurate it was? Yes.  Everyone's trying to blow this thing out of proportion though.Looks like it's time to ask Siri some fucked up shit!!So what is the significance of my children asking how much could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? Based on my house, third parties are going to think wood chucks are of extreme impotence.Pretty sure most woodchuck can get wood.It's a good thing all I use Siri for is asking it do math for me (it can eve do basic calculus!) because I'm too lazy to type it in wolfram. No secrets of mine for you Siri!So, what we can learn from this thread is that we don't have the tech to use computers to decipher what is being asked to siri and how to Interpet the question. Still need humans to do that by listening and interpreting correctly. No. It's probably human assisted learning, where humans correct Siri's automatic interpretations to make it better.I really dont get it.. Either it was in the TOS and they have really nothing to admit to or it wasnt and they will go to court. Which was it?You're not the product, you're the customer - Tim CookI wonder how much revenue these companies generate from selling this data to marketers? You thought the drop in technology prices was a result of economies of scale and cheaper parts? Nope. They all decided to integrate voice and sell your private information.Is there any private information here though? What are marketers going to do with a clip of me yelling SIRI, PLAY OL DERTY BASS TURD!Is anyone really surprised, like really?Just as well I don't use Siri because it's shit if you're anywhere outside the USA. My God, it would be so boring to listen to all that. Reminds me of a youtube video I watched about God listening to his voicemail and it was just people thanking him for dinner over and over and he cut it off...quite amusing actually. i asked some really fucked up things in the hope that this was actually a thing, i'm glad this paid off. This makes me feel better about all the times I've called her a cum gargling gutter whore.Bah, I don't care.  Whatever gets me my tricorder."
"Does this really matter though? I mean, I'm not telling Siri my secrets...... ^^^YetAbout all she gets out of me is What movies are playing, dial [contact] and I'll look up a restaurant if I'm calling in an order.Ask Siri why are fire trucks are red?This is really funny, I have a good friend who is an engineer and In my phone he is under the name Tony Stark. My cousin is in my phone as Bruce Wayne and my brother is in my phone as Captain America. The only time I use siri is to have her call them for me just so I can hear her darling robo voice say Calling Tony Stark  If your talk to a phone there is always a third party in the other side.All they're going to hear from my iPod is me, asking for a weather report, requesting Cure songs and teaching Siri to refer to me as Big Daddy.I don't care as long as it isn't tied to my device. If they are using this stuff anonymously to improve its performance, that makes sense. How else do you improve it?Come on. Is anyone really suprised by this?People use Siri?... That shit doesn't even workOdds the NSA has a deal with apple to turn the mic on whenever they want without warrant?Apple has such a large and loyal customer base but lets be honest they are really going downhill with everything over the past couple of years.Honestly I'm not really sure why everyone Is surprised. It's amazing how many people in this world are willfully ignorant, this is common knowledge in 2015.Isn't this how it functions? I didn't think Apple was the one translating itThey licensed technology from Nuance but they run it on their own servers. What they're doing here is outsourcing corrections to old voice recordings to improve voice recognition. (not really controversy worthy, it was already known they keep the recordings for 2 years. Just people bitching that it leaves Apple)Sick fucks, can't sell a damn thing that doesn't listen to me, apple watch is probably a recorder tooWhat is with Apple--and ANY other company--that does this sort of thing. I now realise that Apple is as untrustworthy as any other company that has been eavesdropping on my private life, that is none of their business. They are as untrustworthy as the US government, and all others, that engage in this sort of dishonesty. Get effed, Apple!!! I, for one, will never buy another of your products. You've lost our trust, and can never regain it!!!Thanks Captain.I am not surprised at all they sold user data. Every company will sell your data (regardless of what they say) for a price!No fucking shit. Apple doesn't have to admit this. Any sane person already knows.[Siri, where can I hide a body?](http://terrywhite.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_9077.jpg)Didn't we already know this? Why do we need their admittance?Omg, I wonder what the third parties will make out of Bazillions of Therabyte of Siri Fuck you and Where I can find hookers nearby..."
"The new Hello Barbie due out this Xmas is a Siri doll. I have to wonder if the kid goes to bed and Barbie is laying on the floor and Mon & Dad are having a conversation, will Barbie be sending that conversation to a 3rd party? Kinda creepy to think about.The real entertainment is that people actually are making this a headline.... Seriously, at which moment in time people actually understand that Apple is doing anything to generate money, and that is the only mission the company has.....Apple share data? Naaaaaaaaawwwwww they're too perfect."
"I don't like the company a bit.Your voice will be used by these third party companies to create advertisements, by you, for you, direct to your watch. Embrace your corporate overlords!What a dilemma for people, their interest in personal information privacy, challenged by their blind love for the company that makes their favourite shine toys. "
"Who will win! They could have just asked Siri Are you sharing my voice data with third parties?Oh great. iOS 9 is going to have yet another screen asking for permission to improve something or other before you can use your device. Pretty soon the setup process is just going to be Apple slowly reading the EULA to you and giving you a test to make sure you listened.wonder how much money someone paid to hear me say set alarm 6am no, set alarm 6am SET ALARM SIX A-M every evening.. before doing it myself.Who didn't think this was already the case?. Its probably in the terms of service. Someone uses Siri? I found it to be pretty much useless.Those poor third parties listening to me say nearby groceries a thousand times. wow i can't believe it. i'm so concernedJoke's on them - the only thing I use Siri voice search for is easter eggs and jokes that Siri may be programmed with."
"If a third party is reviewing, they're getting a lot of Monty Python quotes.And the crowd goes mildI will now start directing the barrage of insults normally reserved for Siri towards the people who listen to what I say. "
"Cortana is shared also.So, when my wife is away on a business trip and I tell her I want to lick her pussy this woman is listening?  nice...  Having a 3 way and didn't even know.  I will try to keep that in mind next time I ask her to fuck my face.No surprise hereJohn: Siri please lick my butthole."
"Siri: John I have send the information to a friend of mine who will validate if this is possible. Also the basis for a recent episode of Person Of Interest.Just a random thought... But if they have access to the recordings of our voice, can this somehow be used as an identifier? Wouldn't it be possible to use a method like this for criminal conviction or anything like that?The voice is listened to and the listener informs apple if a mistake was made. But the user data is completely removed - it's not breaking any laws, and it's still protecting your privacy. I asked Siri:"
"Me: Are you sharing this voice data with a third party?"
"Siri: No comment, [myname]i need to stop asking her who has the biggest weenie in hollywood.Those dirty mother fuckers!Good thing I haven't used Siri once on my iPhone.But more importantly, is My Talking Tom's voice data being shared with third parties? I thought it was already knowledge that they listen to everything said to Siri..  Why? She can't even understand me when I try to order a fucking pizza. Now everyone knows i ask siri what the weather is.... dammit </sarcasm>Siri, do you have a vagina? "
"*receives email from PornHub.*How else would you get results without third parties?People are hearing swear at Siri a lot when she doesn't understand what I say then...I... don't really care. Siri is a clunky piece of shit that I never use anyway. And certainly my phone is sharing other information of mine, in other ways. If they want my Candy Crush high scores so badly, they can have them. I'm not that interesting.I'm sure I read that they do this in their T&Cs. Mayyyyybe I should stop asking Siri to call my dealer for me...Can you expect any kind of privacy anymore? Should we just expect that by hitting the agree button we just forfeit everything?Great, now they know where my favorite sushi place is. It will take forever to get a seat now!>I heard everything from kiddos asking innocent things like 'Siri, do you like me?' to **some guy asking Galaxy to lick his butthole.** I wish I was kidding, she disclosed."
"Dear god...I feel so sorry for them to listen to this type of shit....literally...Frankly, this isn't surprising.  I suppose companies do everything they can to make a dime these days.  Android tracks your travel, google tracks your web history.  There's an industry dependent on collecting said information."
"I can see why people from other countries hate us, because everything is for sale.Which surprises anyone why?Well that's boring. All they're going to hear from me is."
"Set my alarm for 7am"
"Set my alarm for 5 minutes"
"Set my alarm for 10 minutesWho the fuck caresIt's not like we didn't know, they just confirmed it.They're going to hear a lot of set a X minute timer and set an alarm for X:XX tomorrow from me."
"Bastards are going to know when I get up and how I like my eggs, dammit!How is this a surprise to anyone?  We're talking Apple here.  Enjoy the service, but it's like getting a BJ from a meth addict, it's going to come with negative aftereffects. My god, does no one know how wolfram alpha works?Scary but necessary."
"I for one would love flawless speech-text."
"Android shares it too, through Nuance. It specifically spells it out when you attempt to use your Voice Recorder app on the memo function that Nuance collects voice data, sends and stores it on a server, and will do so until they are done with it. Oh, and that they'll be sharing it with any other company who wants (pays for) it enough.siri is a snitch.  fuuuuck.Ill show them! "
"Siri, show me a picture of dickbutt "
"I'm gonna ask so many times, somebody somewhere will ask themselves what the fuck I'm doing. One way or another...wtf. didn't apple always say they care about their customers' privacy and shit? wtf man.And the skies are blue etc.What!? I am outraged![deleted]I for one welcome our ~~Apple~~ **3rd Party** overlords.I like how this is posted nowhere in the /r/apple subreddit. Those guys are in such denial that anything is compromised on their devices Galaxy... lick my butthole. Who cares.Is this surprising? Are we surprised about this?"
"I'm not joking, from the get go, I always assumed people realized that apple would be sharing your Siri conversations with third parties, the same way Facebook shares your social media history."
"I use ok Google and it also requires my device to connect to the Internet to cross check my speech with servers to understand what I want it to do. "
"I completely expect there to be recordings and transcripts of. My search requests on googles side being sold for third party data purposes.Again, they aren't."
"You are easily tricked by blog spam I see.Someone tell me why I should care.Alright, Now they know How long i warm up my pizzas And how long I have to wait before eating after taking my thyroid medication. Oh no!Nooooo shiiiit SherlockI can't access this page without getting a [Kaspersky error](http://i.imgur.com/iRSkFpp.png).

Why else do I need internet connection to say Siri please play Queen. As if there are even other music options?Apple admits they are the A in NSADoes that mean the N is Netflix and the S is Springform? :Olet's all say something weird so it blips their data:"
"chimichanga spidermanThe Samsung TV baloney was baloney and so is this. Yes, this is how it works. It'd be like me admitting I made coffee this AM. Yes, I did.sound bites [sic]"
"Why is this incorrect?Depending on how literal you want to be, a sound bite would refer specifically to a short audio clip of speech used during a radio or TV broadcast.So it *has* to be used in radio or TV? I'm not buying that. "
"Why is it followed by sic, is what I want to know. I don't see why it's wrong. The generally accepted usage of sound bite would not extend to being any recording of someone talking. Whomever added the 'sic' is of that opinion. "
"From the OED:"
"> sound bite   n. orig. U.S. a brief extract from a recorded interview, statement, etc., usu. edited into a news report on account of its aphoristic or provocative quality; transf., a phrase or sentence intended by its speaker to be quoted in this way."
"From Websters:"
">  a short recorded statement that is broadcast on a television or radio news program"
"all together now: Siri, who sucks a dick?you know what... Fuck you apple; you just lost a customer.apple *admits* this is such a fucking non-story. it's in the terms you agree to when you use it. "
"the difference between this story and anything on buzzfeed is there isn't a top 10 list. it's just dumb clickbait because apple is a hot topic and people are stupid.If you want to improve voice interface systems this is pretty much the best way to go about it. "
"As long as everything is kept anonymous data wise and they do there due diligence on who they hire for this type of job I don't see it as a huge problem. Buy a new iPhone every 10 months? uSheep.Anyone who thought otherwise must have been willfully ignorant.I'm sure it's mentioned in the ToS that nobody reads. Anonymous data is reviewed to ensure the program is accurate? Yawnnnnnn.....Good thing it wasn't Samsung, or people would have started a boycott or something.We're not in the data business, we're in the device business. We make great products. We are different than Google."
"blablablais... is anyone surprised? Apple would suck hitlers dick for more money.I don't see this is a huge deal... So a company is contracted out to QA the speech recognition? Are we really that paranoid?this isn't a surprise (to me anyway).  Apple isn't the only operating system that does this, android and all the other smartphone OS's are all giving out info to third parties too. this isn't new information, its just getting easier for people to notice as new technology is released and when they start paying attention to the terms and conditions. "
"for this very reason I keep all location/GPS/voice recognition off on my devices unless I absolutely need it, then turn it off again when I'm done.People actually use Siri? I've had an iPhone since the 3GS came out, I currently have an iPhone 6+ right now. "
"I've used Siri literally ONCE, and that was a 2 second test on my 6+. I then turned it off because I was sick of accidentally pulling it up when texting in class. 1. Stop fucking texting in class."
"2. How the hell do you accidentally pull up Siri whilst using the keyboard?If you accidentally click the button on the keyboard for the voice to text, Siri 'talks' twice before you can exit and it plays out of the speaker even if the phone is on vibrate."
"I've also accidentally clicked the home button and held it down momentarily which brings up Siri who again, plays a voice message out of the speakers which is unskippable. "
"I also don't know why people waste time asking Siri shit that they could find in half the time on Google and without looking like a tool.It came up whenever the teacher tried taking his phone away for using it during class. Apple doesn't sell your data, unlike Google. -Tim Cook"
"He literally said this less than a week ago and r/apple got butthurt when I let em down easy.[deleted]Here, sir!"
"---F"
"It lost a prong.[deleted]It shouldn't.shared with your samsung tv :OAnd nobody gasped in surprise.Apple should be ashamed. But I'm ashamed instead. *cough cough* The stuff we talked about with Siri...Wow, this is a unforeseen surprise and an outrage said no one.I dont have a problem with this, as long as it is improving Siri.and to think you would have been called a Tinfoil hat consperitard a few years ago. Snowden for pres.BREAKING NEWS: JOURNALISTS HAVE READ <COMPANY HERE>'s EULA AND IT SHOWS <THING PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW HERE>If you didn't already think this was happening, in my opinion, you're seriously delusional...Data collection is out of fucking control. Besides not being online at all, what are steps you can take to remain somewhat anonymous and immune to these fucking vultures?  Not be online at all, don't buy anything will any card, wear a disguise anyplace with security cameras. Stay out of line of sight  of any ground viewing satellites, sleep in a faraday cage.But there's catch. No Faraday Cage emporiums in my area i could wear a disguise to to pay for in my Kruger Rand collection. FUCKING DILEMMA. And? How do you think they can translate your voice to text, they have to create the database or improve their algorithm somehow.  So much Apple hate comes out when Apple announces new products. The article clearly mentions other companies doing the same thing, then changes the context of what's actually being done. Should companies making voice-rec technology just say fuck it, it's good enough?"
"And with NSA eating up all the data they can on any network they can, I'd say that companies disclosing what they're doing in long end-user agreements is the least of our concerns."
"I'd be astounded to see even a single piece of real evidence that a major company fucked up ANY thing in someone's unimportant life with some worthless personal info they got that someone spoke to their phone (probably while around other people anyway). That would make way bigger waves than this article meant to fish for site views.Apple didn't admit anything as far as this article is concerned. The author simply reposts the reddit quote and then reposts a bit from the ToS. There are no statements from Apple included in the article."
"OP and author are bundles of sticks.So this is siri, is the galaxy equvalent the same?And this comes after they made that statement about their hardware and software being their products rather than the customers being the product. Lame.On the post for the apple watch the fanboys were defending apple and saying they would never share their private data. Why anybody would pay for such overpriced crap beggars belief.Who gives a shit. But i must be true because you saw it on reddit.Sigh. Every time Tim says something reasonable about privacy. Every fucking time ><And people will still buy apple productsWait, what!"
"Hear I was in my little bubble thinking that Apple was different, that they liked people because we're people, that Bill Gates gave Steve Jobs cancer to get a leg up on the competition, they even have an employee light a candle at the 'Jobs' shrine every time I make an iTunes purchase (I believe it's in the EULA, but then again I didn't read it because Apple is to technology as air is to breathing)... "
"Now you're telling me that Apple is just another corporation trying to squeeze every dollar it can from anywhere it can. From voluntarily ignorant people who didn't take a week to read the EULA no less. I for one won't be taken in by these 'fly by night' accusations."
"Sincerely,"
"Mr. Gull I. Ble (the e has an accent)I really don't see a problem with this. There's no reason for people to freak out about these things.Honestly is this a surprise in regards to any speech recognition software that requires online connection for the translation? It's anonymized from your phone or person unless you say your name. I can honestly count on one finger how many times I've personally told Siri my name, and that was when I set my phone up the first time. Freaking out about this (when the purpose is to try to make the recognition better) is pointless.This is not surprising but I do have a problem with Tim Cook talking like Apple is Holier-than-thou on privacy.You mean to tell me... that this whole time they have actually had that in that big group of words I always click I agree too? OUTRAGOUS Tl;Dr - Apple does something they say they'll do in the License Agreement every Siri-user has to accept first, non-Apple users are outraged.Correction:"
"non-Apple users who didn't read the linked article are outraged.Siri is notorious for listening even when you didn't ask her to! Fuck you apple and your affiliatesAnother thing that bugs me about this is, I've never heard of Apple using money for anything like advancing research and technology or other cool stuff. Not like I do for other companies.  Yet, here they are doing shady stuff for even more revenue while selling you garbage for $400 more than the competition, while probably being less functional. Similar to this woman's experience /u/Fallenmyst from the article, I got a sales job once that terrified me. It was for this software company and would have been the highest paid job I've ever had. I learned about the company though I couldn't take it. Seriously scary shit. My productivity app is about to cut me off of reddit but I can explain later if anyone cares.Wasn't Tim Cook carrying on about privacy recently?if this is even half true there should be a multi billion $ lawsuit "
"Apple and Google Just Attended a Confidential Spy Summit in a Remote English Mansion | The three-day conference included current or former spy chiefs from seven countries, including the US and UK, plus academics and journalists to discuss government surveillance in the aftermath of Snowden's leaksConfidential spy summit."
"Includes Journalists."
"Something doesn't add up.I'm struggling to come up with a title that would have been more editorialized.What's not adding up? Journalists ARE spies. Whether they work for the cia ( a la cooper and probably most of cnn), or they work for firstlook and are charged with documenting intel that the corporate media won't,  journalists have always played an important roll in intelligence operations. Confidential spy summit."
"Front page of reddit.When the title is utter BS what are the odds I'll click the link vs. upvote the first person to point out that we're past tired of the thinly veiled BS? 10 out of 10."
"By no coincidence /u/kulkke is tagged as a poster of trash for selfish karma whoring. I'm close to just ignoring OP but they might make a turn around and stop with the horrible trash NSA/Snowden posts before that meme dies and they move on to the next cow that needs milking.Oh, you caught me champion - all I care about is earning some virtual points in a website, which all get associated with a registered nickname in that very website; and you champion, you managed to solve this just by yourself."
"At the end, if these points are not the things that we all should care about, than what do we live for, right mate? If these sweet points are not that meaningful or that important, than what can be the meaning of our lives?Truly the points just mean you did something that stirred the masses, not that you did something positive, especially when we see some of the utter BS that stirs people up when it should be laughed off and ignored."
"In the end when you're laying there dying and do an audit of what matters, having lead people on wild goose chases shouldn't bring much comfort. In fact it might seem like a terrible waste of time for something that brings you no real joy. "
"Manning, Snowden, Assange, etc.. are naive and foolish. I cringe as I see people misunderstand what the truth really is but honestly that's a burden which shouldn't be on everyone's shoulders. Just ask the people who know, they will gladly admit there's some bliss in ignorance.Oh my God, you caught me again. =/"
"I don't know what caused this absurd way of thinking of yours or in what kind of reality are you living in - but sure, the result is not even entertaining. But if you like to hear these, here it comes for you:"
"Yeah! Champion, you are one great person that unfolds the truth again and again; you are the person that finds the real intentions behind some nasty website accounts; you are the defender of Hgollarop. Hurra!Uhh look at my posting history. I'm not a champion, I'm a real person posting honest shit with zero aim for glory."
"If someone shadowbans this account it'll suddenly stop being used and I'll start using my other throwaways. When I post something too honest to the wrong crowd, I don't delete it to save myself from downvotes, because that's not the point."
"Keep on trying to reverse the mock, you're the one with the look at this laughable bullshit post history. I mean we're here on one of your greats about a CONFIDENTIAL SPY SUMMIT .. with Reporters .. LOL.. That's the very definition of laughable bullshit and that's the podium you're standing on.Hmm, sure, do you also want cookie mate?so confidential i's on reddit a few hours after it's done"
"i'm surprised there wasn't a live stream with commentary of the eventFuture shills for anti-privacy policies and programs...The journalists are their because they need to know how the big corps, want the news spun, what details to leave out and which to emphasize.Take journalists' names, see how they write up the parts of the summit they were allowed to see. Those who report what they're told are marked for future puppeteering, er, that is, careers as 'reliable sources'. Those who actually try to be journalists are marked to be kept out of sensitive areas and encouraged to report from war zones.then you never heard of bilderberg conferences, did you?Also:"
"> At an 18th-century mansion in England's countryside last week, current and former spy chiefs from seven countries **faced off** with representatives from tech giants Apple and Google"
"Here's what that facing off [looked like.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58JrxLL3u2s)Well perhaps they must deal with this kind of shit and they don't necessarily want it to be confidential. But its crazy to me that as a regular person I'm aware that all this mass surveillance is just big corp racket so why do google and apple act like they don't know what this is really aboutDuh they're telling the journalists what to report it's a cover up yoJournalists are going to only report on non-confidential stuff. This is some man of steel level logic."
"Super important mission to stop Zod from terraforming."
"Lois Lane is there.And most like they'll have some digital device on them, much easier to hack them when they come to you.This is the fake summit. The REAL one is happening next weekend ;)It was so confidential, nobody knows about it! I'd have to agree... I was all intrigued until they started naming off individuals per state/country like there's no tomorrow. Then it just started to sound like something I'd like to switch off. PR department meeting.The journalists are just attending so that their governmental and corporate overlords can tell them what they're not allowed to write about.Journalists have always been invited to this sort of thing."
"How else will they know what to report? What stories will they tell, or what should they keep quiet on. What keeps ratings up, without damaging the cause?"
"I use the term 'journalist' lightly, of course. Sensationalist reddit title. The actual article headline was less Sensationalist.\*Sigh*"
"/r/technology, why do I even bother.Yeah, I feel your pain. I used to love this shit, but self selection has me moving further and further into specific interests and out of the public dialogue.  I think there might actually be something to be said for maintaining these ties to public conceptions and understanding. If you move too far away, it will be hard to maintain a grasp on what the proles think and feel.They have to be taught how to spin this to the world.Lets see if the contents if this meeting are ever reported on.It makes perfect sense."
"Who do you think writes up those government propaganda and publishes them?"
"Journalist are recruited by spy agencies while still in college.  After graduation they get placements to work for major news agencies."
"journalists "
"If it's as shady as reddit is assuming then these journalists have zero integrity and are only there to learn what agenda to pedal through their respective media outlets."
"Just a thought,They have journalists there so they can tell them what to release to the public to make them look transparent and open.Exactly.  Confidential journalists are akin to jumbo shrimp.  It's an oxymoron.  Their job is to report.  Basically, I take out of this, anyone who doesn't hang is part of the party and can fuck off."
"To take a line out of Green Street Hooligans: fucking journos.I'm forever blowing bubbles,"
"Pretty bubbles in the air,"
"They fly so high,"
"Nearly reach the sky,"
"Then like my dreams,"
"They fade and die.Its so they can say but look, we invited these journalists! While in reality, those journalists have signed an NDA that will prevent them reporting on anything that was discussed."
"And even then, would you really want to piss off some of the most powerful spy agencies in the world?Pfft."
"The most powerful spy agencies in the world are the ones who can't afford to piss off the journalists."
"Everything the journalists get they're going to be able to publish or leverage into some other story.  "
"Sure the NYT plays lapdog to the government, but they do that in exchange for exclusives.  If the diva journalists get pissed off and have secret information, nothing is preventing them from just giving it to wikileaks where the government can't spin the story because they have no influence.  If they don't have a publishable story, then they're not losing anything when they give an unpublishable story away."
"*edit: not to mention the fact taht announcing it doesn't really gain any goodwill if the meeting is closed in any capacity.  They could have just not announced it and risked nothing at all.* "
"*Nobody is going to be thinking that a meeting of industry heads and spy agencies is progress in open government, and nobody NOTICES when the meetings are secret, so there's no benefit to trying to spin this.   So the simplest explanation is that this is completely genuine and they're looking for criticism.*"
"*And since:"
"1. *government meeting industry heads is super-suspicious* "
"2. *Coming to the conclusion that it's genuine requires thinking*"
"3. *people are idiots*"
"*A double-fakout would STILL result in worse PR than a closed meeting. The only reason they'd do this in public is if they actually wanted feedback.  If they had a closed feedback meeting there would be backlash later when it became public out of necessity for its function.  A closed* **evil** *meeting would stay closed after, so no backlash*You're making journalists out to be brave paragons that won't bow to threats made by government officials."

">nothing is preventing them from just giving it to wikileaks where the government can't spin the story because they have no influence. If they don't have a publishable story, then they're not losing anything when they give an unpublishable story away."
"Journalists don't need to be brave paragons, they just need to be capable getting pissed off and doing something that will subvert the government's intentions without getting caught."
"Leaking the info is plausibly deniable and it's easy enough to get away with that the government hasn't been able to close its own leaks.See that? See that key phrase? Without getting caught"
"That's the kicker. Hasn't worked out too well for the people who have actually done this, what makes you think it's suddenly so simple to release the info without fear of repercussion? Yeah, if I do a dead-drop then no one will know it was me! Those stupid Feds!! Why hasn't anyone thought of this before? -twirls mustache and dons trenchcoat-"
"But no, please just keep making snide comments in the hopes that no one will notice youre repeating yourself without adding anything else. While reading is hard, writing is harder. It's ok, no ones judging you.>That's the kicker. Hasn't worked out too well for the people who have actually done this, "
"Which journalists would that be? "
"Are you talking about Glenn Greenwald's underlings in the UK (and not the ones in the US)?"
"Drake's treatment didn't stop manning, manning's treatment didn't stop snowden, snowden's treatment didn't stop starling, none of those were journalists and all of them outed themselves.The thing preventing them is fear, individually. Everything you said makes sense enough with journalists as a group, but if they're found out or suspected shit gets real. Governments are very effective at destroying an individual's life ."
"Edit: before the edit.Don't talk about the Ministry of Love in an ungood way, they're listening and they'll send you to room 101.They put the wrong address on the invitations to the journalists. We invited a bunch of them... strange that none of them showed.  Huh, oh well.Yeah, I want a reddit ama!  NDA? That leaves a paper trail. Here's a million dollars, say anything we didn't tell you to or we kill you You sound like an anti conspiracy nut. How about you keep an eye on this story and post a link to the transcript. Do you suppose they are talking about how to secure our privacy?An NDA should be pretty effective not to mention legal and cheap."
"The reporter would likely be required to sign the NDA in front of summit representatives and hand it back right away.  He won't have a copy and not even any pictures.  His employer would have to do the equivalent."
"Even if a copy got leaked, it would have the reporter's name and the summit name once only hereafter referred to as ....  The rest would be fairly standard wording to say he can't tell anyone even the smallest detail from the summit."
"Should he break the NDA, he'd be in deep shit with his employer and some extremely powerful lawyers.A paper trail nobody will follow because a) nobody cares enough to look b) if they somehow did look AND report it, I doubt the American general public would give a solitary shit and the story would be buried in whatever dumb thing Justin Beiber said recently.>dumb thing Justin Beiber said recently."
"Right now they are all up in arms about the fact that Hillary Clinton sent *gasp* emails while she was secretary of state.they could have just had another secret industry meeting out of a million.   They do that all the time and nobody cares after a week.  They're not going to gain any public goodwill from a closed meeting so if they're restricting the press in any capacity it  would be cheaper safer and easier just to not announce it."
"The whole idea is a tinfoilhat conspiracy angle and both your hats are full of holes.Million dollars? Please. Here's your paycheck. Go pretend to be a journalist.NDA? That leaves a paper trail. Here's ~~a million dollars, say anything we didn't tell you to or we kill you~~ your head editor on the line. He's just gotten off the phone with the owner, and he says if you don't comply, you'll lose your job, get thoroughly discredited for some bullshit story from 20 years ago, and nobody will hire you as even a paperboy as long as you live. who do you think fabricates the cover stories?Can I put on my tinfoil hat now?WHY DID YOU TAKE IT _OFF_?!?I was getting it cleaned!I have some news for you. The hat's been compromised. In 1970s the [Church Committee investigated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Committee) and found there were [700 journalists secretly on the CIA payroll whose job was misinforming the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird#Church_Committee_investigations). What do you think that number is today? 7000 journalists? More?Wow, that's crazy. I never knew that!Holy crap. Is that for real? If that shit was going on then what the hell's going on today? Makes all those conspiracy theorists not seem so crazy.."
"Makes ya think, huh?Welcome to the rabbit hole.Given that the term conspiracy theorist was coined by the CIA...source?It's probably less expensive and more secure to make sure the good journalists are never successful, and that bad, easily controlled journalists are fed fabricated information and evidence.Yeah, that was the fake summit.  Microsoft and IBM were at the real one.Amazon too. People love Amazon but love to overlook the massive contract they won over IBM in the past year for an extreme scale solution for the NSA. I'd be more interested in where Cisco, Juniper, and Adtran are!In Zurich, with the gnomes ;)Juniper is at a conference about new ways to milk money out of people that have bought their hardware"
"Cisco is at a conference about new ways to use their cloud platform "
"Adtran is at a conference for hardware providers that have been almost completely forgotten about.Is Adtran still a thing?CenturyLink and other major internet providers use them as border routers all the time!  Not cheap either, but really shitty looking builds, IMO.Routers or DSLAMs?I've seen them used as DSLAMs at the provider border in MDFs and Copper over Ethernet media converters, although they provide routing/visibility functionality, too, for the provider.They're going to throw the journalists into a shark tank, obviously. Or the ones that don't cooperate. Or if everyone cooperates, a random one just to make a point.But do the sharks have lasers? What do you think the anthrax was for.... "
"oh sorry different story."
"Will the sharks have laser beams attached to their heads? There are no sharks, only ill-tempered sea bassDon't drop the sea bass! Well it's a start...The shark union is having a fit. No sharks would give their time, not even for a human snacky snack. A local farmhand let them borrow the wood chipper. It's one of those embedded journalists, but really just a regime scriber."
"btw. I don't think these companies realises how fast the world and competition will turn against them. They think they are the only one who can provide whatever service they are doing right now.-They think they are the only one who can provide whatever service they are doing right now."

"This I likeWell I didn't pay for a giant fucking shark tank to NOT throw people in!If only there was a button that you could press to indicate that you enjoyed a commentDo the sharks have freakin laser beams on their heads?Yes the Sharks will indeed have ***frickin'*** laser beams on their heads!What are you going to do, release the hounds? Or the bees? Or the hounds with bees in their mouths, so that when they bark they shoot bees at you?They are actually autonomous robot-sharks with railguns.No, they wear Google Glass. A bit underwhelming if you ask me.No they have jet fuel.I think you meant * frikken*, Scott.Now, how shall I kill you? Acid, or Sharks?"
"*I don't know milord, they both sound terrible*"
"Acid Sharks it is.Are those sharks that swim in acid or sharks that spit acid?Sharks covered in lemon juice and have attachments to squirt lemon juice. You know, so that it stings a lot when they bite you.They both swim in acid and are, thusly, mostly acid themselves. The saliva of an acid shark is usually more acidic than the surrounding fluid, so the bites hurt extra bad.Or the dogs. Or the bees. Or the dogs that when they bark they shoot bees out of their mouth... Sharks that are acidCould be sharks that just swallow you whole so you dissolve in their stomach acid.Toothless sharksBut isn't the whole shark skin like many many teeth?Skinless and toothless thentell my mother-in-law I said hi and fuck off.We throw some LSD into the poolThat is truly horrificShould into water, journalists into pool, wait an hour, RELEASE THE SHARKS! or just tell them there are sharks in there after the acid kicks in...If you're lucky, they'll eat it first and will be too high to eat you.Or they throw THC into the pool and the sharks get mad munchies and eat you faster, leaving human crumbs all over their favorite airbrush style Bob Marley t-shirt. Nah, they would probably just forget me overnight in their oven. Luckily, they were too high to turn the oven on. are they at least ill tempered?Thats a pretty shitty confidential spy summit if we're reading about it online...Goddamn Mainstream Media always covering up the troofs On that same note, it usually irritates me when headlines include the world quietly (seems especially common in /r/politics). It's like the author's suggesting that any trivial act must be considered clandestine and underhanded because the people involved didn't hold an immediate press conference, even though they made no effort to conceal anything (as evidenced by the fact it was covered by mainstream journalism).smoke and mirrors by the worst offendersReminds me of the joke that the problem with the CIA is that it is best known for its covert activities.I think you're mixing up confidential and secret. We know almost nothing of what was discussed aside from intended topics, so I'd say it's definitely confidential.The content of what is discussed is not confidential. It operates under the [Chatham House rule](http://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule), meaning all the content can be repeated, but the person who said it needs to be kept confidential."

"> The discussions are held under what is called the Chatham House Rule, meaning what is said by each attendee during the meetings cannot be publicly revealed, a setup intended to encourage open and frank discussion. "
"While one can claim that's not an outright lie, it's at least very, very misleading."
"Given this context, the headline is also misleading clickbait. Yes, it's true, but it's unlikely to mean what it attempts to imply (the companies discussing how to do more surveillance)."
"Another quote from the article is more interesting:"
"> There was **general agreement** across broad divides of opinion that Snowden - love him or hate him - had changed the landscape; and that **change towards transparency**, or at least 'translucency' and providing more information about intelligence activities affecting privacy, was **both overdue and necessary**.Ah, this is a very common misunderstanding of the Chatham House Rule.

Without it, there is no such thing as secure communication over the internet.It's all fun and games until someone in power gets their iMessages sniffed on a public network.More like the password to their bank account.I agree with him. If you outlaw encryption, only outlaws will have encryption. I've heard the exact same argument used with 'gun' in place of 'encryption'. Of course, the key difference is that one protects your property with deadly force, while the other protects it with passive force.Sounds like a familiar sentiment. Yet the government has no problem regulating weapons. I'm not a gun advocate necessarily but it seems like common sense to me that when you outlaw anything you just create a black market for it. Same argument for the second amendment.Sure. But we'll be able to crack the encryptionSame argument is used by pro gunners about gun control. Ban guns, only criminals will have guns. What about guns?Like gun control. The NRA can use this exact slogan. 'If you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns.'And then yay the rest of us who use encryption to be secure will be monitored since we would be indistinguishable from the outlaws  Just like with gunsWhen did politicians start believing that making something illegal will stop criminals... they're fucking criminals.

You can make a simple shotgun out of a nail and two pieces of pipe. Most gun designs that are considered modern are from the 60s or before, newer guns just iterate on those same basic designs. No, he built a receiver, which is the easiest part of an AK to build. Now let's see him build a barrel and a bolt.He built about the same percentage of that gun as someone implementing a cryptographic package built the encryption. He also didn't mine the ore to make the metal. You'd be surprised how easy to is to encrypt something well starting from scratch, and you'd be similarly surprised how non-functional a receiver is without a barrel and a fire control group, let alone a bolt.I'm a sysadmin for a living and I own several guns including a few that I put together, so I wouldn't be surprised by any of those things. Bolts aren't hard to come by in this country, neither are barrels or fire   control groups. The engineering specs for all those things are also no more a secret than the math that you need to encrypt something. I imagine homemade bullets are a lot harder to make.The bullets themselves aren't the hard part. For bullets you just make a mold, melt some metal, and pour it in the mold. They're just a solid piece of metal. The hardest part of making a fully functional round is the primer, because it requires very precise work. But knowing that, you could always modify the design of the gun you're making to use rounds that don't require that sort of primer, if you know you're going to be making your own ammo from scratch. Do you not also need to make gunpowder? Sounds quite complicated as compared to downloading some encryption software.you don't really even need gunpowder, but you do need a method of propulsion.It's all about skills you already have. It's easier for someone who is on here already to encrypt something using their computer, sure. But people, say where I grew up, out in the sticks. A lot of them already know how to make black powder. Smokeless powder is harder, but from what I know black powder isn't that hard and people still use it to hunt. They don't make it themselves because they can buy it, but a lot of them know how. Those people on the other hand would have a much harder time properly encrypting something and an even harder time actually coming up with encryption themselves. It's more about the materials you need access to. Yes some people might know more about manufacturing certain physical items than how to program or use software. "
"Point is the only physical materials you need to do encryption is a general purpose computer, you can't deny that's a whole lot easier to get than the tools and materials necessary to make a firearm."
"No, but you need materials as well as the instructions to make a gun."
"To use encryption you just need the equation. Computers make it faster, but you could do it by hand it you really wanted to (I wouldn't recommend it).To use encryption effectively, you need a computer. Nobody is SHA512 encrypting an entire message by hand, except cryptographers maybe. You also still need instructions to encrypt something, you need to understand math at a high level as well as knowing the algorithm if you're not using a computer. If you're using a computer, you need to know how to encrypt the message and how to send it, plus have the software to do so.Gun materials: Gunpowder and household junk + simple knowledge.  "
"Encryption materials: Computer and education + complex knowledge.  "
"Not a big barrier to entry for either.But they're not talking about outlawing a specific set of encrypted data -- they're talking about outlawing encryption.  That's like outlawing the knowledge of how to make a gun out of a shovel with basic tools, NOT outlawing the gun itself."
"Which makes enforcement something that belongs to the Thought Police: I see that you're doing something with that data that sure looks like it is transforming it into something unrecognizable.  I don't care if it's your bank account number or the plans to a secret airplane... what you're doing is illegal and must be stopped!"
"Here's another thought: what's the difference between encryption and encoding in general?  Are they going to make binary blobs and network level compression illegal too?  Because strong compression is indistinguishable from strong encryption.A nail and two pieces of pipe aren't thin air."
"Encryption is also less likely to prune you out through natural selection when you accidentally make a pipebomb and trigger it next to your face.You don't encrypt things out of thin air either. Unless you're literally doing the math to encrypt and decrypt something yourself, which the average person is not doing or going to do."
"Edit: effectively encrypt I should say. You can technically encrypt something with a caesar cipher easily without a computer or some other hardware, and it would be broken pretty much immediately. People didn't used to send bullets going 1500-2500 feet per second, until somebody thought up the gun. Your argument is like saying You don't shoot things out of thin air. Unless you're literally throwing a bullet 1500-2500 feet per second to cause damage to something, yourself, which the average person could not do."
"Of course they can't. That's the point of a gun. Likewise, calculating by hand RSA encryption has little practical use. The technology that actually *enacts* RSA encryption is very useful."
"Just because some individual cannot do it themselves, doesn't mean there isn't a solution that does it, or does it very, very well."
"That's really what is incredible about being human. If you have a problem, it's very likely that it's been solved, at least to some extent. If you're resourceful enough, you can take hold of that solution. Somebody's already out-thought you and figured out how to solve the problem. You just haven't found that solution, yet.> You can build a rudimentary one relatively easily. This[1] dude made an AK almost completely out of a shovel with basic tools."
"lol yeah, all you need is a full metal shop with a forge, a magazine, and the ammo. So easy! That's why, as we all know, criminals make their guns instead of buying them from straw purchasers.People are so far removed from how things work it is hilarious. That forge is some concrete sitting over top of some brick and with fire inside. Magazines (not clips) are just bent metal and a spring. The ammo is the hardest part to make yourself, more specifically the primer, but you can still do it. High-quality firearms were being manufactured long before steam engines were invented. do you know how many shooting sprees have been committed by people with home made guns in countries with stricter gun laws?[deleted]Compared to the rest of the civilized world it's the largest factor."
"Is mental health an issue? Yes. Media coverage? Yes. Preexisting crime rates? Yes."
"Does making it harder to get guns have a more immediate effect? Overwhelmingly, yes.Well it's a large part of it. You do know that In most of the shooting sprees that occurred in states with gun control, the guns were obtained in states without control, right?It's certainly a big factor.I think Americans fail to understand that *guns* aren't the American exclusivity, *gun violence* is."
"Guns don't kill people, but people without guns don't shoot people.Although to be fair the entire point of this comment thread is that if you outlaw X, only the outlaws will have X the point is there won't be a place where people don't have guns to shoot people. The whole concept is that isn't possible. You just create a place where only the criminals that want to shoot people have guns. "
"Criminals have guns in both scenarios, the difference is that law abiding citizens don't. None because there's no point for now. If you banned 100% of all guns, that's when you would see homemade guns, just like you already see homemade bombs. No amount of legislation can prevent people from killing each other. Humans are too fragile.I don't recall seeing any homemade guns while in the UK. You can still get guns in the UK. You can get up to a .22 rifle in the UK for pest controlYou mean [like this?](http://imgur.com/MkJSRRB)"
"That is a .22 I bought for my dad for his birthday.So I've always considered myself more on the anti-gun side than the pro-gun side but I understand that complete prohibition won't work (just like with drugs and such), but I've never really seen an argument that adequately explains a responsible pro-gun opinion (ie a good way to have pro-gun [rights] legislation while simultaneously reducing gun violence). Do you have one/know of one? Not trying to be a dick or anything, just would like to be more informed on the topic.Yes, we need more conceal carriers, and we need to get rid of gun free zones. Think about it, what is the one thing that stops an active shooter? Police right? Well how do they stop the shooter? They shoot the shooter... with a gun. You could argue vigilantism should be left to trained adults, but conceal carriers go through mandatory training already. And people practise shooting guns all the time for fun, so it's not like accuracy would be an issue. [There are already many examples of people taking down shooters with their own guns](http://www.personaldefenseworld.com/2015/03/10-cases-where-an-armed-citizen-took-down-an-active-shooter/#10-cases-where-an-armed-citizen-took-down-an-active-shooter-2), and since conceal carrying is getting more popular, I expect to see more stories of people preventing or mitagating shootings.Ok fair enough but a lot of people (myself included) are just uneasy with the idea of anyone being able to have a gun on them. Like there are a lot of people who would pass a screening process but could still have crazy anger issues (ie road rage).  I know they are definitely a huge minority and 99% of gun owners are responsible but that 1% scares the shit out of me.Here are some statistics that should make you more comfortable then."
"Gun ownership is already common. 1 in 3 people own guns. You've gone your whole life surrounded by gun owners."
"Everyone aside from convicted felons are already allowed to have a gun on them. Everyone can already transport guns in their car. We bassically have unrestricted access to firearms in this country, and we haven't descended into anarchy. Anyone who wants to kill people already has unlimited freedom to pick up a weapon and kill people, yet it's extremely rare. "
"Relative to other ways to die, guns should be the least of your worries. If you're confident enough to get on the freeway, there's no reason to be scared of guns. Over a million people die a year to car accidents. About 10k die a year to guns. I just don't understand how it's so scary. I'd be more worried about a bad diet than guns."
"Crime is at an all time low. You're living in the safest time in american history, and our gun laws have only been getting more relaxed. Gun laws used to be really restrictive, even in red states because people feared black people. Over the past 50 years, we've made huge amounts of progress in expanding gun rights, and we're only getting safer. This is actually a terrible argument. One would expect most shootings to occur via large-scale manufactured guns because there are far more of them and in the USA they are (for people who aren't good at DIYs) actually easier to come by. Make store bought guns illegal long enough and you won't be surprised to find out how many more murders there are committed by home-made weaponry.None, because why would you make an inferior product to do the job of a superior product that's easily obtained?What's your point? It's obviously still possible to acquire mass manufactured guns in those countries, and that's far easier than making your own. But if literally all guns were outlawed and unable to be acquired, then you can bet people would make their own guns.> http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2015/08/11/mystery-9mm-machine-pistol-seized-europe/"
"Soon, many."
"The Charlie Hebdo shooters didn't even need to make their own, and that was in France.ask chicago.None, they use either the guns they can still get or other means like arson/bombs. My point is that guns aren't magic. They're made from pretty basic materials. Funny you mention that.  In recent months police agencies have been finding these mysterious fully automatic machine pistols all across rights restrictive European nations...  http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2015/08/11/mystery-9mm-machine-pistol-seized-europe/"
"The origin of the pistol is still unknown.Oh what a shocker, criminals can get guns even if they are banned!"
"I don't understand why its so hard for people to understand this. [deleted]One thing I find very curious is the fake manufacturer markings.  If they are fake, then why bother doing the work to make them?  Is there some sort of underground product market to the point where there is brand recognition or something?I'd imagine so. With out some sort of name you're gonna walk up to your underworld gun dealer and ask for the black one with no name. It helps give a way to reference it just like people brand their weed or other drugs. So you know your getting the same thin you ordered before.I could make a bomb out of stuff I can buy at the hardware store. But we don't have complete assembled bombs on the shelf for sale because this would obviously lead to more bombings.The exact same logic applies. Both are tools that law abiding citizens can use to protect themselves and their privacy, while they're also capable of misuse by criminals. Any kind of ban only applies to law abiding individuals (by definition)."
"The only differences appear in their perceptions. One person might think Yes! Outlaw encryption because I don't have anything to hide while another person might say Yes! Ban guns because I don't have/like/want one.A gun is a phyical thing. You can't read a book and suddenly have a gun in your hand, or download ammunition."
"Encryption is an algorithm, a numerical recipe. A more apt analogy would be banning the recipe for gun powder and claiming this will stop terrorists from shooting people.would you download a bullet?The difference here is that it is literally impossible to outlaw encryption. Anyone with basic computer literacy can set up encrypted communication no matter how much the government tells us it's illegal. It's just math.We just have to encrypt guns and then guns are impossible to outlaw. Checkmate.The difference here is that it is literally impossible to outlaw guns. Anyone with a 3D-Printer or lathe and basic machining skills can make a gun, no matter how much the government tells us it's illegal. It's just fabrication.It's baffling how much Reddit loves to believe and enforce their echo chamber. What you said is entirely accurate, and yet they seem to think it's incredibly easy to just find a CS major who will encrypt stuff for you. I bet it's easier to convince a local machinist to break the law and make a gun than to convince a CS major to do it. But all it takes is a couple people downvoting you to hide your counterargument and help them maintain their hilariously ignorant confirmation bias. It's equal parts funny and sad.But you only need a few CS majors for everyone to have encryption."
"Also the encryption export bans didn't work either.CS majors are people, not vending machines. Not everything uses encryption, and it isn't suddenly going to start if it becomes illegal.What are you trying to say here? I honestly don't get how that applies to what I said.>find a CS major who will encrypt stuff for you"
"Why would you need to do that? There are loads of extensions and add-ons that allow you to use encryption by literally just clicking a few buttons:"
"[Virtu email encryption](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/virtru-email-encryption/nemmanchfojaehgkbgcfmdiidbopakpp?hl=en-US)"
"[Encipher It](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/encipher-it/fimncfoplhkgepigcpgjheeccdhemcfj?hl=en)"
"[Cryptocat](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cryptocat/gonbigodpnfghidmnphnadhepmbabhij?hl=en)"
"etc.It's a sad day when reddit has fallen so far that its users think running a few GPG commands requires a CS majorI mean, not necessarily a gunpowder firearm, although that's not *that* complicated, but everyone and their mom can make something deadly with much ease. Encryption, though, that shit is mad science to the overwhelming majority of people.But you don't need to *create* the crypto, merely download software. The issue isn't that the technology is trivial, the issue is that it's merely information and can be freely transmitted, copied, installed, and used by anyone. "
"Guns are tangible property, so while it's certainly possible for people to exchange the commodity, it takes a good deal more effort to acquire an illegally made or smuggled gun than to download freely available software. "
"Think about the protest aspect as well. If all guns were outlawed and collected, it would require a pretty substantial effort to distribute guns to a major share of the population. But digital revolutionaries need only publish openly licensed open source software from an off-shore server to completely subvert the ban... and the entity engaging in this protest doesn't even need to spend a lot of money or risk prosecution."
"Finally, consider enforcement. Exactly how would a ban on encryption be enforced? To know there is encryption at all, the government entity enforcing the ban would need to intrusively monitor billions of digital communications devices on a fairly constant basis. But if the crypto is any good, it would be nearly impossible to even detect in the first place, whereas a gun would become fairly easy to spot the moment it was used. So while enforcing a ban on guns would probably be difficult, enforcing a ban on cryptography would be literally impossible. You don't need to be a CS Major to set up some encryption software. You just need to know how to use Google and have the ability to read for about 10 minutes. That's a lot less skill than 3d printing a working gun (which you still have to buy the ammunition for from somewhere)Wasn't there a design on the internet a bit back for an m16 that is good for a few hundred rounds."
"So technically anyone who is good at google fu can make a gun.Yes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DconsfGsXyA"
"They get to about 30 rounds in that video but I assume they've made more progress.Oh this is what we're gonna do today? We're gonna fight?This is just a wild guess, but I'd say computers/computer skills are a bit more common in the general populace than machining equipment/machining skills. Also bullets.I am actually very pro-gun, but I really don't think it does any good to bring it up in this situation. The UK (which has already essentially outlawed guns) now wants to outlaw encryption, and my point is that no matter how hard they try, they will never be able to outlaw encryption with the same effectiveness that they have outlawed guns."
"The UK hasn't outlawed guns or anything like it. It has LICENSED guns and there are over 1.8 million in private ownership. Thats a lot for a country of 65 million where guns are supposed to be outlawed. "
"Millions of people in this country have fired weapons you're not even allowed to as a civilian in the USA such as fully automatic assault rifles. By the age of 14 I'd fired everything from a .22 rifle through to a 7.62 GPMG, the British equivalent of the M60, and a 40mm Bofors anti-aircraft gun."
"Shit if I want to fire a gun here in England without a firearms license I can walk half a mile to my local gun club any weekday night, pay a PS4 non member range fee, pay for my ammunition and use one of their club target rifles.You can own machine guns in the USA. It's complicated and like everything else, partially state specific, but you can.The principle is the same for both, the difference is that encrypting something takes literally millionths of the effort machining a(n effective) gun does.One time pads are dead simple and can be done using pen and paper. So long as the key is random and never reused, it's an incredibly strong system.That doesn't make it impossible to outlaw it. At all. It makes it impossible to eradicate it. "
"Which is also true of alcohol, drugs, guns, and basically any other highly marketable thing. Outlawing them does not make them go away - except in the hands of those who revere the law above all else i.e. *not* criminals.>That doesn't make it impossible to outlaw it. At all. It makes it impossible to eradicate it."
"Sure, a semantic error. You knew what I meant."
">Which is also true of alcohol, drugs, guns"
"Encryption is different from these things in that it is not a physical, tangible thing. It is essentially just an idea. A government can no more prevent multiplying two numbers together than they can prevent encryption (actually that's really all [encryption](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(algorithm\)) is). I agree that drugs and guns cannot truly be completely eradicated, but they can be to a much greater degree than encryption can.And to take it a step further, if you know the the government is looking for encrypted traffic, you can start hiding communications inside other data. For example, I wrote a working program that let me hide the entire text of the Neuromancer inside this image:"
"http://i.imgur.com/hR1dRZB.png"
"Granted, this is not the actual image file, I used a bitmap (which would be considerably larger in size) but it *can* be done. You'd never know there was any information hidden unless you knew specifically *where* to look (it is possible to find it, see if you can!), and even if you found it, you'd still not be able to read it unless you had the encryption key.ELI5, where is the data in this image? Sounds really coolIt's called [Steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography) and it's pretty cool.It's hard to get a true ELI5 explanation, but bear with me. "
"Any computer image is nothing but a huge array of pixels. Each pixel requires a certain amount of data to accurately convey color. In this case, each pixel uses three bytes. This is called 24 bit color mode. Each byte consists of eight bits. (8 bits *x* 3 bytes = 24 bits). What I do is take the least significant bit of each byte, and set it to one bit of payload data. You are left with an intact image that is visibly indistinguishable from the original. The payload data can be arbitrary, but in this case, I included an encrypted, compressed text file of the story The Neuromancer."
"The amount of data you can hide is determined by the geometry of the file. Let's say you have a 640x480 bitmap. Each pixel needs three bytes, and each byte can hold one bit of payload data. So... this bitmap would be approximately 921 KB. That means, I can hide 921 Kb (kilobits) or 115 Kilobytes. You can hide a LOT of data in 115 kilobytes.Thanks for that explanation! I suppose you don't even need a reference image to determine what data is there so long as you know the image is carrying a payload.Correct. There is a fixed scheme for how the data is stored. If you supply the correct key, it will be there. If you don't, you'll never be able to distinguish what's there from background noise.To elaborate (someone correct me if I'm wrong), the data being hidden in the picture is only a layer of obscurity (not encryption). It's like hiding a box in the bushes. "
"He mentions that, once unpacked, his payload is encrypted. So it's like he hid a box in the bushes, but also put a lock on it. Now someone would need to find the box AND have the key to unlock it."
"This distinction is an important one in cryptography because simply coding your payload into a picture like that could be easily intercepted if anyone ever deciphered the process (in this case, to look at the least significant bit of each byte).Comparing encryption to locks is misleading.  Encryption transforms the data.  So it's more like he took a box and stuck it inside wet concrete molded into the shape of a rock, and then  hid THAT in the bushes.  Now someone needs to find the rock, AND know that there's something inside worth chipping away at it to get."
"But you're right: steganography requires the original content be properly encrypted (such that cryptanalysis doesn't find any non-random repeating features) or else discovering the encoded content and then reversing it becomes trivial and can be automated.I mean the same applies to every illegal act. They've banned certain things but they keep getting done by the criminals who don't care about the law. Murder is illegal but that doesn't stop hundreds from being murdered every year. Drugs are illegal but that doesn't stop literally anyone from getting and using them. "
"Banning encryption only serves to make the innocent more vulnerable. Correct. You cannot uninvent something that already exists."
"It's staggering how many people I speak with that do not get this simple idea.Guns have been invented, yet are illegal in many countries. Same with cocaine. Right, because it's so hard to get cocaine or guns in countries where they are illegal.As is marijuana.If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns. Yeah but you cannot un-invent a gun or cocaine. People still use guns and cocaine even when illegal.Encryption algorithms are widely available (you can download from another country or ask an CS undergrad to code one up for you). At least with physical goods you have a chance at restricting access.So... basically.. Personally encrypt shit you want to keep private? Isn't this a given? Anyone who values encryption can't trust a corporation that is also lobbying for something else. If they want it bad enough, they'll sacrifice anything provided they can still deny it. "
"Sure we can trust Apple, Google or DroptoNSAbox, but that is just ignorance. Look at The Fappening.. Look at Google. They're a company that started off based on AD revenue.. You think your personal information is something they want locked away and inaccessible? Like discovering a inhabited continent Tell that to the war on drugs. I'm just saying. This is Apple we're talking about. Nothing is invented until they invent it.>  You cannot uninvent something that already exists."
"Counterargument: Like crypto, child porn exists and can be copied at zero cost, but banning it reduces its availability to everybody, including the criminal element."
"So banning stuff, even trivially producible stuff,  often works OK.>It's staggering how many people I speak with that do not get this simple idea."
"I get it, but from a certain perspective it isn't. "
"For many American's (or, humans in general), their exposure to technology isn't from a position of an informed consumer."
"Take for example: "
"* Verizon Wireless has a new ad that touts 50% less cost for their 'XXL' data package."
"* Fine print: 'compared to the next lowest tier'"
"Wat. Da. Fug. That's just one example. "
"Reddit, especially /r/technology, has a user bias as most users are embraced to modern technology, more informed, and passionate about keeping it free."
"That's not the case elsewhere."
"Look at Comcast. They own media outlets for a reason. (Granted, many reasons...). Imagine being able to influence people across multiple media outlets, while at the same time creating artificial limits in the communication pipelines (the internet) to boost profits. "
"So when it comes to things like cybersecurity, encryption, etc., how can we expect the average citizen that can't program their own DVR to understand it?"
"I passionately think (speaking as a US citizen) US citizens need to know more about encryption, don't think I'm arguing anything different."
"The way technology is changing, the population body really will have a hard time keeping up. As we approach the 'AI bubble' where algorithms and slick programming are going to start replacing jobs, we talk about it and it's exciting but we often forget something: **We're not telling people to stop getting degrees in areas that are going to get replaced; on a larger scale, we have no plan for what to do when thousands and thousands of jobs are replaced**."
"The other day I saw a machine that was flipping a sign. Yep. They automated the need for a sign flipper. Then we start thinking about automation in bigger categories. Fast food. Trucking. Driving. "
"Point is, all of this stuff is changing and we really need to understand that the population majority won't understand it. At that point something like encryption becomes an argument of Aren't you tough on crime?. Same reason bills like the Patriot Act pass. It's not patriotic. It's just a name. If you don't support it, YOU AREN'T A PATRIOT."
"You don't support banning encryption? YOU SUPPORT CYBERCRIME."
"Fucking awful. "
"The thing that's kind of more ridiculous is the existence of one-time pads.  Trivially simple encryption that's also perfect, and works just fine for digital messages or written ones.  They DO require organization though.So you're saying you can't put the shit back in to the horse?I don't see why a skilled surgeon couldn'tIt's the same impulse that leads to echo-chamber rejection of any other culturally scary ... well, anything.  The Good People Like Me in a safe camp with the warriors guarding us, and the Bad People outside worldview is probably genetically embedded, and it's behind a lot of this. Intelligent people's brains shut down when they're scared, too."
"Same with gun control slowing down crime to an extent. Maybe the petty criminals but anyone that would want a gun could get one I think the difference between encryption and guns is that with guns, not everybody wants to use them. Of those that do, not everyone is going to have the time and inclination to become competent in their use. They say that if you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns, but in many areas that becomes a near reality even without laws banning guns. Those that do tend to use them in crime, often crimes of passion."
"But with encryption, at the very least, every time you buy something on the Internet, you're using encryption. I can only imagine what other legitimate uses mandating backdoors would endanger.That doesn't mean you can't make it harder for people to get."
"I don't think you should halt or weaken encryption, but I don't think the then only the bad guys will have it argument is the best route."
"I think it's better to compare it to locks. People need locks for many reasons. Weakening locks would make the entire nation less secure.That's a really good analogy. Nobody'd be stupid enough to say We need to ban padlocks! It must be easier for law enforcement to get inside a criminal's house!, and yet that's exactly what an encryption ban is.They'd only insist that the government gets to have the master key, which also shouldn't happen.The issue is that locks can be broken with enough resources, while properly built encryption is totally secure regardless of the money you throw at the problem.Like those TSA locks?"
"Yeah, they are a master keyed system, and people have reverse engineered the TSA master keys because you can get a large enough sample at any hardware store.Are we talking about guns or encryption?Both. Trying to completely ban/outlaw guns is beyond retarded, same goes for encryption. The desire to outlaw them, and most other things for that matter, is based on irrational fears and boogeymen. Only violent criminals and nutjobs use guns! Civil people have no need for tools of destruction,  Only pedophiles and people who commit crimes want encryption! Civil people have nothing to hide!.I think after the fappening  the public would be more aware of the need for people other than terrorists and pedo's to use encryption. "
"I don't want it to be difficult for my doctor to adequately secure my records. [removed]Thoughtcrimes.They've tried that with drugs, guns, and many other things. They can't even keep them out of prisons. Banning objects works just as well as banning knowledge. I do find it somewhat ironic that this issue is important to the redditing community at large and therefore the same anti gun control message is used- which reddit is largely against. "
"Outlaw X and only criminals will have X. Works in so many cases and is probably the best emotional appeal for an issue.> Outlaw X and only criminals will have X. Works in so many cases "
"Works in all cases. "
"> is probably the best emotional appeal for an issue."
"No emotions; only facts and logic.I don't really agree that it's an emotional appeal. It seems like a logical appeal to me because it logically follows that criminals won't obey the law and such laws will only harm law-abiding people. The difference is that Reddit sees encryption as benefiting everyone, while Reddit sees guns as not benefiting everyone."
"I'm not here to argue about guns, but they're right about encryption.this is the first thing i thought of when i saw that headline. same argument about guns.is gun control a major issue among the American prison population?  No. But a few still find their way into inmate hands every year. "
"My point is that prison is literally the most controlled environment that most people could ever be exposed to in the US and they can't keep contraband out of the hands of the prisoners. Even if we all lived as prisoners, we would not be able to completely solve the problem and I don't think that anybody is willing to live their entire lives on lockdown. No but drugs are.The whole scenario really makes me think back to a book i read in high school called Harrison Bergeron. You can't control the idea of encryption since it is just math. It is like legislating stupidity.[Harrison Bergeron](http://www.tnellen.com/cybereng/harrison.html) is actually not a book, it's a short story by Kurt Vonnegut! You can draw a lot of parallels between this and [Export Grade Cryptography.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FREAK)It has been a long time since i was in high school. looks like i remembered it being a lot longer than it was.Especially when the thing that exists is just math.And in some form or another has been around for 1000s of years. The Romans used primitive encryption for their military communications. "
"Anyone that's suggesting banning encryption is a grade A moron. Any politicians doing should it be removed on account of mental disability. They're not fit to run a lemonade stand, much less a government.I have found that drugs are fairly effective in undiscovering math. I've found the opposite. Amphetamine has turned me into a math/programming boss.[removed]I'm a professional methematician, and this joke is soooooo old. (but that won't stop me from using it)Using what? Meth or math? Maybe both? But if you stop using math for  meth then how do you know if you're getting ripped off.When you get into the really complex stuff, ma/eth cease to be differentiable. Tried it once in high school. *MAN* was it ever trippy. Never again. I'm done with derivatives.The cynical part of me says that the government knows this already, and it's not the terrorists' data they're after. Terrorism just gives them a nice excuse to ban encryption so they can spy on all of us. Look into the history of communism over the past century and how the U.S. dealt with it. You get stuff like the Red Scare, Bay of Pigs, and DOZENS of Democratically-elected Communist governments. Basically, Terrorism is the new Communism and we've been fed a crock of shit for decades. People are still falling for it. The Military-Industrial complex is very real, it's not some conspiracy.You should append more easily, because that's the issue. Not whether they can, but the resources required.They do.  But if you make it so only terrorist can use encryption, legally, it sure does make it a lot easier to spot the terrorists!you mean the realistic, sensical, logical, and historically-referencing part of you? that part is smart. listen to it.> Terrorism just gives them a nice excuse to ban encryption so they can spy on all of us."
"If they ban encryption the entire banking industry will grind to a halt. It's required for communication and secure data storage.While I think so too, it's not right to think that way. It's like saying all terrorist are perfect and that they will never make a mistake. The more info the government has the more chance they have of catching a mistake. I don't agree with that but you're argument for it is not goodEveryone always assume conspiracies, but in honesty the best way to do bad things is to find **true believers** and then direct their outrage to benefit yourself."
"Kind of the entire background of organized religion being created.Exactly. They know full well this won't do shit to help against der turrists, what they're after is control. Full control over everyone."
"Politician up-and-coming that might rock the boat and upset corporation's profit-making ability? Well let's just dig up their browsing history and smear them with some kinky shit they looked at 5 years ago. Suddenly they're unelectable!/r/conspiracyNever waste a good tragedy.Im probably going to get shit on for saying this. But this is the same Exact principle to gun control. It's different, and the comparison is disingenuous. "
"For one thing, control implies regulations. I don't think anyone thinks there should be no regulations on guns or encryption. So this would only work if discussing a ban on encryption alongside a ban on guns. And that's not even close to the discussion on the table; it's always been about the degree of the regulations."
"More than that, all things equal, they aren't. Encryption is far more important to liberty than guns in the modern era. Guns are a method, one of many, of protecting yourself. Encryption is the only method of protecting digital information, and information is everything; it has every piece if meaningful data on everyone on the planet. It's the largest violation of freedom in history."
"And lastly, defiantly saying that gun bans would never work because guns already exist is foolish when you look at nations that DO have a ban on guns, have low crime, and 1/4 of the homicides the US has."
"I'm not arguing for a gun ban, but trying yo say it can never work is retarded when you consider it exists and it works.  You can say it's not for us; fair enough. But don't say it's an inherently flawed practice.But there is no regulations on encrypting. I could encrypt any data I want in couple minites.Im more interested in what the non-cynical part of you says?That they're really just that stupid. 'The government' or elected officials? The latter makes policy, and can be astonishingly clueless.Thought police, crime prevention.its a sad state of affairs when cynicism and realism are indistinguishable.> The cynical part of me says that..."
"I don't think you're being cynical at all, given the bills they're trying to pass and the businesses paying government to push these bills.There is nothing cynical about your line of thought. This is exactly the case. For Your Safety is the oldest line in the book.That's hardly cynical. There is no shortage of unambiguous evidence that this is exactly what government wants. I remember reading somewhere a while back that the NSA still bulk stores encrypted data they can't access and then they come back and crack it years later once they have the computing power/ability to do so.Unencrypted data from Americans is on a rolling deletion cycle. If they don't receive a warrant within 30 days (IIRC) it's flushed. "
"Encrypted data is stored indefinitely, but there are not attempts made to decrypt it (computationally infeasible) unless they receive a warrant. And even then it should be computationally infeasible to decrypt. That would be in no way unsurprising.meanwhile, if you ban real crypto, people will buy from someone who doesn't. the rest of the world is getting real tired of our shitEven more cynical:  They know there's nothing to find and don't give a shit, but expanding data collection expands contracts and budget."
"Ultimately government should be a way for me to legally redirect public money into my pocket.> expanding data collection expands contracts and budget"
"The main aim is and always has been financial gain, but not though bloating, try fraud. If you get wind of an upcoming windfall e.g. an oil company finding a new field then you can invest in the company *before* the knowledge becomes public. A form of insider trading for all extents and purposes. "
"There are also dozens of proven cases going back decades when these spy networks have been exposed as being used to steal technologies and to get an advantage in trade negotiations. The infamous 2001 EU Parliament report into ECHELON details them and that's what was known about 15 years ago!"
"All of this stuff *pre-dates* the fascination with the War on Terror by a long-shot. Economic espionage has traditionally been the primary function of spy networks. It would be naive to believe this has changed. Security theater is an incredibly lucrative business."
"The NSA's primary 'function' aside from that is economic espionage, as it also spies on foreign countries.And the TSA's primary function is as a federal jobs program.Give a man a fish, feed him for a day.  Give a man a TSA screening job and improve employment numbers for low-skilled labor! Can we just pay them to pick up litter on the side of the roads or something like that? I feel like that would improve the populace's lives much more than what we're currently paying them for.I say we pay them to make art. Paintings, music, dance, Youtube tv shows, whatever they might be good at.  At least there is some evidence that exposure to art reduces criminal behavior, unlike TSA searches.there is everything to find out. a complete record of everyones lives. the amount of money you can extract from this is infinite. insider information in every market, deep knowledge in human psychology. a complete sample size for advertisers. the possibilities are endless."
"then the pervs get all their sexts. "
"they arent doing it for no reason. no one does something for no reason.Ah, the Iron Law of Bureaucracy: An organisation will always put its interests ahead of its goals. And another top quote. This thread is a goldmineIt's the first thing I was taught in management 101: the primary goal of *anything*, including any group, is self-preservation.Some of the government might know this and are tricking the parts of government who don't know."
"Always assume your politicians are clueless and keep sending them knowledge whenever it looks like they're ignorant.UK's minister of internet security used to work in Google AND FacebookWhat particularly objectionable things has Joanna Shields been responsible for?The fact that there are so many documented examples of rogue agents conspiring to commit criminal acts within an agency using the agencies' resources demonstrates that this is possible and probably likely. "
"Just humans being humans. Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.Hmmm, where have I heard that before? Yet that's just not how reality works.A good quote, but more of a general observation than an actual rule. You honestly think the NSA, our fucking intelligence agency, is just straight up ignorant? Bullshit. This is not ignorance, this is control. Nobody in power wants an informed public. Let alone a public with the means to defend themselves. Yes, your normal day to day politicians might be clueless but not our intelligence agency. "
"Edit- I'm a dangus and flew right past the UK part but the point remains. Top people in power are not idiots or ignorant. They are well informed. "
"It's a big club....and YOU AIN'T IN IT!-George Carlin> You honestly think the NSA, our fucking intelligence agency, is just straight up ignorant? Bullshit. "
"The commenters above are not referring to the NSA, but to politicians in general. It was suggested that the most likely case is that a subset of people in government want to deliberately spy, and the rest of the politicians just thinks they're doing the right thing, as told by the smarter/more powerful people. The NSA was never mentioned.I still have a hard time believing that the majority of politicians are unaware of the ramifications of all this. They may be outta touch with some issues but not when it comes to the subject of power, influence, and control on a wide scale.[deleted]But blatant ignorance is intent.[removed]I'm on your side, but I think saying our lives are at stake is a little hyperbolic. Plus, that's the type of fear-mongering we're trying to combat."
"edit: In case it wasn't clear, I'm on your side. As in, I'm for encryption and think it's important for protecting privacy, which, again, I'm for.If someone stole my identity they could pretty much steal my life along with it.Many medical devices we use on a daily basis rely on encryption. If that encryption is compromised bad actors could potentially gain access to things like medicine pumps, heart monitors, and many other devices. Lives aren't always at stake, but it's hard to say compromising encryption doesn't at least make us less safe in life threatening situations."
"Source: work in healthcare information security.This, also every Tesla on the road as well as every piece of farming equipment and grid connected power station. If we open ourself up to low grade encryption we give ourselves to whomever wants to hack and take us over.I managed to convince my mostly computer illiterate grandparents by comparing encryption to bank vault."
"A strong encryption is the shinny 2 ft solid steel door with all the fancy lock on it at the bank down the street."
"A weak encryption is like the wooden front door of the house."
"No encryption is like the public park across the street from the bank."
"When you have sensitive or highly valuable stuff, do you keep it on the bench in the park, a closet in the house, or in a locked box in the bank's vault?"
"And now they believe encryption to be very important and the government is been stupid.I prefer a safe, an envelope and a postcard."
"A safe has a lock and a combination that can only be opened with the combination or a lot of effort. This is like strong encryption."
"An envelope is openable by the government if they want but there are rules saying when they can and can't do it. There's also very little protection against a criminal who gets into your  mailbox. This is like a government backdoor."
"A postcard is public and readable by anyone who can see it. It's not necessarily plastered on billboards but anyone who handles your mail can read it  easily. This is no encryption at all.Haha. Yes, that does sound like a closer analogy. It was spur of the moment, and we were just at the bank. So that's the only analogy I could thought of at the time."
"Oh well, it worked, so that's all that matters. :PYou could use an analogy with only a safe.  Imagine a super secure 2 feet thick steel safe with a high tech ultra secure unlocking mechanism that's unlocked by some sort of iris scanner or facial recognition technology.  The only persons that can access the safe are those authorised to be able to open it by the scanner.  However the safe also has a shitty traditional pin tumbler lock and master key that overides the high tech scanner so that the government can come along with their master key and check you're not keeping anything they disapprove of in the safe."
"So what happens when some nefarious person comes along and decides they want access to your safe?  They obviously cant abuse the scanner to gain authorisation without another authorised person present, so the only weak point of entry is the shitty traditional lock.  Being a knowledgeable person on how such locks work, they know that there are several methods of entry using just the vulnerabilities of the traditional pin tumbler lock.  They could try and find a way to obtain the master key, but that's unlikely to happen.  They could drill the lock open and try to gain access to the inside of the other locking mechanism but this may be too much of a brute force approach that damages the higher tech lock, but it might just work.  They could however learn to pick locks and simply open the lock with a simple lock picking set purchased from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/GOSO-Piece-Lock-Pick-Set/dp/B0079IKMX6).  Even locks that are designed to defeat lock pickers can be overcome by someone who who [reasonably practised at the art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI7Lx-73lU0).  Lastly, they could find out what sort of key is required to open the lock and then manufacture what is known as a bump key that will [open up any lock of its type without even having to know what the original key looked like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=131j0htYIoU).  "
"So yea, not only has the addition of a master key rendered the high tech lock useless, but its also given a way of entry to anyone with a bit of technical know how that doesn't even require access to the master key.That is way too much information and fancy high tech stuff for my grandparents. LOL. Years of dealing with them has taught me that - when it comes to technology, keep it simple, keep it something they can relate to.What If Apple would just stop selling their products in the UK in th event of an encryption ban?considering Apple products are popular in the UK and the UK is a major market for Apple i am guessing they won't.Who would win, in that situation? No one.I know that Apple is too greedy to lose on UKs worth of sales..."
"[But *if*.](http://i.imgur.com/SZAXMD7.jpg)That cash that Joker is burning in that picture is absolutely nothing compared to the cash that Apple could burn. "
"Apple has approximately $250 billion in cash. "
"Scale wise, that's roughly 2,000 pallets of cash. "
"They could lose UK sales for a couple years and be totally fine, they wouldn't even blink. Apple does have ~~millions~~ billions in cash to fall back to."
"And who wouldn't love to see some riots in London over no more iPhones?"
"But yeah, everyone does lose.206 Billion actually, but yea, they won't pull the product, but they might get creative about it.Apple. Riot different.This is truly the most innovative riot yet.It's beyond innovative. It's ... *revolutionary.*It would probably cause enough public backlash to get the government to reverse its decision.One election cycle is all it would take. The politicians who made the law would be booted from office. Politicians against the law would be voted it. The law would disappear. Apple could sell their phones again. Everyone wins.Except for the massive loss of sales by Apple, it's gonna hurt Apple a lot more than the UK and there's no certainty it would take one cycle, that's just your prediction."
"Edit: I'm just pointing out it's not as simple a decision as this looks, there is potential losses/gains no matter what direction they go unless certain political action is taken.I personally hope that if Apple has any respect for the privacy of its customers, they would stop selling the products, and release a statement as to why they came to this decision.http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2127048/Apple-6bn-UK--paid-10m-tax.html"
"This article indicates that about 10% of Apple's revenue comes from the UK. That is quite significant, but considering what a firm position Cook has taken on this issue I would not be surprised if Apple pulled out of the UK rather than backdoor their products. Pretty old article 3yrs~. I really doubt it's that high anymore because Apple has expanded to several more markets since (namely China). Accommodating the UK regulations would be expensive and potentially damaging to the security of their services in other regions (you can't remove end to end encryption from iMessage in just the UK). So I could definitely see it being more worthwhile for Apple to pull out of the UK to at least some extent. Think of all the good press and publicity they would get. Wouldn't they just disable iMessage in the UK? Seems to me that this would be the most reasonable thing to do. I truly hope this would happen - if only to see Cameron backpedalling like the clueless cunt he is.You wouldn't see that happening. He'll come out with some BS exception or something but he won't admit he was wrong in any way.Please don't disparage cunts by comparing them to David Cameron. They already have enough problems in this world to deal with, being cunts and all. Excuse me, I take offence it that word. Please use asterisks at least next time, like D\*\*\*d C\*\****n.Dhunter2d Chunter2nI know, so offensive."

"[deleted]TIL I'm a bad people. Obviously the government know that. Tim is saying this to inform the average citizen. The gov says they *need* to spy for their safety, and Tim is pointing out this isn't the case, and will only work against the average citizen.Tim knows that too. But he can't just say it that way. He's doing the best he can to retain our right to encryption. Good guy Tim CookWhat I really like is that Apple put a 'canary in the coal mine' with a statement on their webpage saying they have never surrendered data to a government agency (paraphrased). I believe the thought is that they aren't allowed to keep it unless it's true, and since they can't reveal a secret court order, they're giving a warning if they remove it. Quite a few websites do this, actually:"
"https://canarywatch.org/Tim Cook can and has been [saying it that way, to anyone who will listen](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/10/01/445026470/apple-ceo-tim-cook-privacy-is-a-fundamental-human-right):"
">I don't think you will hear the [National Security Agency] asking for a back door. ... There have been different conversations with the FBI, I think, over time. ... But my own view is everyone's coming around to some core tenets. And those core tenets are that encryption is a must in today's world."
">And I think everybody's coming around also to recognizing that any back door means a back door for bad guys as well as good guys. And so a back door is a nonstarter. It means we are all not safe. ... I don't support a back door for any government, ever.So this is why Tim Cook has been getting unwarranted sheit, all along? He doesn't want to get in line with backdooring and general security dismantling?I'm pretty confident that he's familiar with backdooringIt's funny because he's gay"
"Samsung's CEO is even more gay. And waterproofFor the record, anyone who doesn't use Apple products or has a Jihad against them: I've been able to format my Hard Drives using AES encryption for years, and when you reformat a drive it gives you three options in OS X.  Quick format which just writes over the old information, full format which writes 0s over every block on the hard drive before formatting it, and an extended format that will write random bits of data all over the hard drive and wipe it 7 times before formatting your drive.The formatting on osx is nice. When I sold my MacBook, I just picked the option to wipe three times because why not. Took 3 hours lol.The write 0 option is all you need. There has been ample research that it's impossible to recover data from a drive wiped like that.Actually, if that drive is encrypted and you erase the keys then all data will be no more then noise.True. How hard is it to brute force the keys? Serious question. I imagine the NSA has farms of systems designed specifically to brute form through encryption.Breaking it through brute force would be impossible, as in, the universe would undergo heat death before then even if you combined all of the computing power worldwide. Their only hope would be to discover and exploit a weakness in the encryption algorithm.> How hard is it to brute force the keys?"
"As shown above, even with a supercomputer, it would take 1 billion billion years to crack the 128-bit AES key using brute force attack. This is more than the age of the universe (13.75 billion years)"
"[Source](http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1279619)Don't forget, they can store your data and decrypt once quantum computing is viable. That might take a while, but when storing seriously incriminating stuff, this might be important.> Don't forget, they can store your data and decrypt once quantum computing is viable."
"AES is not vulnerable to quantum computers. Well, slightly, using something called Grover's algorithm, but doubling the key size will easily stop that.Quantum computers can't crack AES256, it remains strong even against Grover's algorithm For an encrypted hard drive, simply overwriting they key is sufficient. But 7 times man!then microwave it.  Thanks Mr. Robot.I accidentally chose this option when formatting a 300gb partition on an external hard drive. It took 14 hoursThat's the standard for many organizations and even the govt so I can see why Apple would support it. In reality a simple override with 0's is more than sufficient. Worked for a company that refurbished gov't/university computers for use in high school and elementary schools. "
"The gov't drives were often wiped once before sent to us and then we had to reformat them using the 7 write process. Took forever on mechanical hard drives.> Quick format which just writes over the old information, "
"Actually quick format just removes the directory entries that tell the drive that there's something there. The data is all still there, untouched. This is absolutely true, which is why I actually like the extended format options on OS X.  I usually just go for writing 0's because the extended format takes something like an entire day, but I totally appreciate having the option.I'm a linux sysadmin."
"Without strong encryption I have no idea how I'd do my work on a day to day basis."
"I'm pretty sure if the US outlaws encryption for everyone, then tons of companies will move to a country where it's legal."
"Are they going to outlaw it for personal use only and force everyone tech savvy to incorporate themselves? That's also silly.Don't be a pussy and just telnet.  Correct. And we have enough flaws in our security now. Weak encryption makes hack almost trivial. The government are the ones spying. The way this sentence is laid out, they are the bad people. What's the point in telling them this?Victim disarmament.If Apple really wants to get the message across, they should refuse to sell Apple products in the UK if they implement this. Make an example of them. When 60 million people can't get access to their precious iPhones, they'll start screaming at the government and the government will back down. And Apple can afford to forgo UK profits for a time.[removed]I've always thought of it like this."
"Trained robbers rarely bust down the front door. They get in through weaknesses in the building and surgically collect the cash, then get out as quietly as they entered."
"The government would rather bust down the front door and case the joint just to make sure you're not up to anything.The government would rather forbid you from having a door, actually.I will try a slightly different angle on why they want this. This is about being lazy. The government wants to leverage you against you when you do something bad. This is a nice way around the 5h amendment. "
"The FBI might be the front for this chatter on the hill but they are not the ones crying like babies. That is the DEA. The DEA had grown accustomed to wire tapping every one and any one they liked if they could even vaguely justify involvement in drug activity. These people hired IT people finally and no longer use standard level non-encryption to communicate.  They use end to end encrypted iMessages. This is why they are hell bent on bringing down iMessage. The DEA does not want to use human intelligence they just want to go back to the old way they worked which is skim and exploit you agains you. "
"This terror smoke screen is that a smoke screen. "
"I am now putting on my tin foil hat, and say once they have this massive data bank who is minding the shop so to speak. Once you have this data how will it be used if your not subject to a current investigation. This is where they invoke the secrets act. The end point is full history of you and when it suits them call it back up. This should be immensely scary to people.  You realize this is about the UK, not the US right?I am aware.  I am also aware that the UK could be a bell weather for where america wants to go. The Five Eyes arrangement makes it too likely that expanded surveillance powers in the UK -- where they already record *all* Internet traffic under Tempora -- can be used against Americans via intelligence sharing and parallel construction. Something scarier than the NSA is the NSA minus the Bill of Rights, and there is such a thing: GCHQ.Well that is trueAaaaaaaaaaamen.  "
"Organizations under the governments, like the CIA, FBI, NSA, already know this.  Our leaders are either naive or evil enough to believe it.  A-fucking-men. Laws are not there to stop the law breakers. Law breakers don't care about breaking the law."
"It's the UK government to be specific. They are not to be trustedInformation gathering is not to counter terrorism it is to get an advantage in economy. It has nothing to do with fighting terrorism Ten bucks says he won't apply that logic to guns.If you outlaw guns, then only outlaws will have guns."
"Well, duh.[If you outlaw encryption, only outlaws will have encryption.](https://xkcd.com/504/)It's pretty fucked up companies are trying to protect us from our governments. It should be the other way around.You can replace the word encryption with the second amendment and still have a true statement.   As a matter of fact, the first amendment would also be an appropriate substitute. Finally, something from Apple that I can get with! Apple CEO..."
"You mean Tim Cook?OP: He who shall not be named...How many people off the street would know who that is though? It's better to make it easier for people to recognize."
"Edit: AutocorrectTim Cook"
"You mean the CEO of Apple?Apple CEO..."
"You mean Tim Cook?Yes, the CEO of Apple is in position to be Tim cook."
"Wait a minute....WTF? Why am I seeing so many comments about gun control in here? It's not even remotely close to the same issue. If I owned a gun, there's no way a government or other entity could spy on me with it."
"As soon as we allow one person in through a back door, it means criminals can get through it to. There's no point in twisting that analogy to work with guns because computers can't kill people (unless it's a big server and falls in someone).Because the If you outlaw encryption only outlaws with have encryption is a verbatim argument against gun control if you replace encryption with guns. This argument is super common among gun control opponents.ITT: gun controlThis is EXACTLY the same argument that can be used ANYTIME a government wants to use to ban anything. If it has a good side and a bad side (which everything does) then someone in government wants to take it from the people. Bad people will be bad no matter what the government does. except in this case, the solution being proposed would do literally nothing to hurt criminals. they would simply not use algorithms that have a backdoor."
"for the average person, this is a nightmare scenario. breaking encryption is essentially a nation-wide enforcement of compromised internet connections for individuals and businesses. "
"on top of that, the government would have full plaintext access to all communication sent by any entity using a device in their jurisdiction."
"> Over the last 16 months, as I've debated this issue around the world, every single time somebody has said to me, I don't really worry about invasions of privacy because I don't have anything to hide. I always say the same thing to them. I get out a pen, I write down my email address. I say, Here's my email address. What I want you to do when you get home is email me the passwords to all of your email accounts, not just the nice, respectable work one in your name, but all of them, because I want to be able to just troll through what it is you're doing online, read what I want to read and publish whatever I find interesting. After all, if you're not a bad person, if you're doing nothing wrong, you should have nothing to hide. Not a single person has taken me up on that offer."
"Glenn Greenwald in Why privacy matters - TED Talk*drops iphone*when they talk about banning encryption what does it actually mean for someone who isn't computer savvy? Do they mean anyone can read my emails and messages etc?It basically means if you ever thought about starting a company that helps people who have had identity theft it's becoming a really good time to do it.so, then we all have to become criminals with the knowledge to encrypt our own phones. "
"we all go to jail>not enough jails and building them seems silly> everyone on lifetime house arrest>still go to work/school/hang out and live our lives because they still need people to turn the wheels and press the buttons, but under FULL surveillance>3 meals a day and full medical care provided at tax payer expenses>It's like requiring that everyone have no locks on their doors by law. Criminals will have clandestine locks installed and be safe. Law-abiding people will be in constant danger and have their homes trespassed into all the time by criminals.This is the same paradigm with the war on drugs."
"Simply outlawing and maybe adding stronger punishments does not give the government control more control. In fact it does the complete opposite. You lose control of what you are attempting to control.'Good people', have morals, morals are anti-government..100% true and accurate. If you halt something that is mostly used by good people, to protect themselves, the bad guys will still be able to hurt them."
"Sound familiar?"
"I was legitimately flabbergasted when I read this headline. I thought to myself....this is exactly the same point with law abiding gun owners.This is the same for gun laws.Could we not replace the word 'encryption' with 'firearms'?Exactly like gun laws.  Thank you for making a great parallel.  It's almost like the same argument with gun laws ... Take away guns from everyone then only the bad guys have them and not the good .Maybe Apple can put some funding into https://letsencrypt.org then. 2nd AmendmentThose who would give up essential liberty, to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety."
"-- Benjamin FranklinI think this can apply to weapons tooIsn't this the same argument with guns, drugs, and prostitution?Gun Control LogicI'm not really sure what this quote means.  it means anyone who is going to use encryption to evade the law will do so whether or not the encryption used is illegal."
"outlawing encryption or weakening it with backdoors severely hurts people who want to protect their personal identifying information when, for example, shopping online or accessing personal accounts from their mobile device. "
"compromised encryption can be exploited very easily for the benefit of hackers and identity thieves. in the security world, if an encryption scheme is  even suspected to be weak by some attack, it is essentially sworn off and replaced by a more secure algorithm. government-backdoor encryption is broken by design and is a joke in the security community. it's ludicrous that this is even being proposed let alone discussed in a serious manner.sounds like gun controlWhy does this sound like the anti-gun control argument?Same thing with gunsSounds like the argument for guns. Funny that we accept thus argument for encryption, but not gun control, especially with the advent of 3d printersSimilar argument to be made for overreaching gun control?[removed]Yes. Especially in the US as we already have 300,000,000 firearms in private hands. If you banned them tomorrow the criminals wouldn't turn theirs in and it would take probably 50 years to make a good dent in the illegal firearms. If you banned guns tomorrow, 99% of law-abiding people would also not turn them in.    > If you banned guns tomorrow, 99% of law-abiding people would also not turn them in.    "
"That's an oxymoron. I think it is understood to what I meant.  If you want to be technical, fine, 99% of law-abiding people would suddenly become criminals because they wouldn't turn them in.  Shouldn't the second amendment apply to encryption? Has anyone tried to make this argument in court? It doesn't seem like such a stretch of logic, if you think about it.I think the 1st Amendment is all we really need to defend encryption. The founders even used encryption when they sent letters (hiding messages in code). "
"You can't ban speech except in cases where it endangers others like screaming fire in a crowded theater or telling everyone to kill such and such (ex. Hate speech). Encryption by itself is neutral. It would be like trying to ban a language just because only a few people can read it.  "
"The only reason encryption used to be restricted was because it was classified as weaponry/state secrets and the 1st Amendment doesn't give people the right to endanger the nation by exporting/selling state secrets. However that argument is dead since everyone has encryption now. Restricting big companies from including high-end encryption for their customers doesn't change the fact that they can get it elsewhere. "
"Terrorists don't need iMessage and I doubt they trust it anyways. When they are building bombs or buying weapons do you really think they aren't buying military grade encryption? "
"> A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."
"Arms seem pretty ambiguous so maybe. But then again, that could also mean background checks for the use of encryption, just like people want background checks for the use of guns. Or maybe, just like you may need a permit to carry guns, you may need a permit to use encryption.It definitely seems like a huge stretch of logic. The second amendment deals with a completely different subject matter. Both encryption and arms are tools to fight tyranny. I think it's a valid comparison. I guess the logical step is akin to how patenting something people do every day in the physical world, but on the internet is absurd. So why do we draw a distinction between being armed in the physical world, vs arming oneself on the internet?[removed]The 1st Amendment and 4th Amendment seem to apply much more clearly here."
"1st -- no abridging the freedom of speech -- i.e. I can send you encrypted code, or whatever else I want."
"4th -- No unreasonable searches and seizures -- i.e. privacy against their reviewing my communication for code/content they don't like.I've never thought of it like this. Have an upvote No. It cannot; they are different entities with different uses with different reasons for existing with different abuses."
"It's like comparing oranges and rocks.[removed]There are similarities in the argument, but no similarities behind WHY you would make that argument, nor the objects being argued about."
"It's like saying training your dog to pee outside makes life easier, so you should train your kid to pee outside.> There are similarities in the argument"
"Isn't that literally what the person you were responding to was saying? Exactly, came here for this.  The only caveat is that if your kid accidentally gets your encryption keys he's not likely to kill himself. [removed]Many gun deaths are due to previously law abiding citizens. The kind of people who would not own an illegal firearm. Things like accidental death and 2nd degree murder (no premeditation, just anger). That being said, I'm against banning guns altogether. Waiting periods and background checks do save lives. Also, buying a gun on the black market is not as easy as the NRA would have you believe. It's also much harder for a 5 year old to understand encryption than it is to shoot somebodyWhich is a huge difference, so its not really the same argument at all when any sort of context is included.But that's the point: the authorities want to track the good people. They have other methods for tracking bad people -- they always have, back when encryption meant secret book codes and dead-drops. It's called espionage, and governments are very good at it."
"But they want to control the masses, and the best way to do that is make sure they (the masses) know that the government knows (or will find out) all their dirty little secrets.ITT: a gun control debate in /r/technologyMy thoughts exactly: when encryption is outlawed only the outlaws will have encryption!Why are we still buying into this terrorism argument? It's just a stupid talking point. This is about the average person and collecting their money. Government is strangling us with taxes and crippling the world economy to save their asses.  THIS IS ABOUT YOUR DATA AND HOW THAT DATA CAN BE USED TO CONTROL YOU AND YOUR MONEY. FYI public officials: If you're not smart enough to understand why weakening encryption is a very bad thing, you shouldn't be making decisions for the public interest. Think of Apple what you will, but come privacy these guys are on top compared to other major tech companies. The ol' gun control argument.Surprise! It was never about the bad people.This is pretty similar to part of the pro gun argument actually.The idea that stopping encryption helps catch criminals is ridiculous, any serious criminals will buy encryption packages if necessary.  "
"The war on data is like the war on drugs. Currently a massive waste of time and money.Apple CEO: I'll say whatever it takes to sell more product. I'm an Apple fan, btw.That's no doubt the whole point. "
"Spying on the average citizen is no doubt far more important to these agencies who want to weaken it than spying on the tiny amount of terrorists and the like out there. "
"The likelihood of anyone in an industrialized nation being a victim of terrorism violence is so low that it barely exists. "
"In the USA, in the past several years combined the amount of people dead from terrorist violence just barely ekes into double digits, as in somewhere between 10 and 20 depending on how you count and what you include as terrorism. Basically none of it was Muslim terrorism, which seems to be the bogey man du jour."
"Meanwhile, tens of thousands have died in traffic, 8500 people have been murdered with guns in non-terrorism involved ways, and millions have perished from preventable illnesses and the like. Terrorism barely registers on the chart."
"For that, people should give up their civil liberties and right to privacy?"
"Seriously?Ah, Apple CEO, you are so adorable."
"It's not to go after whatever excuse they can come up with. It's to acquire and maintain power by doing things like illegally monitor those communications through the ministries that have no supervision (i.e. defense industries) for the interests of those who govern so that they can keep on governing. It is so naively egocentric that they would seriously jeopardize the security of their telecommunication services because of it."
"The law is not for everyone. I though that myth had been debunked some time ago. It is a high ceiling that gives a house advantage to the established few and maintains order between equals.Were going to ban use of the letter 'e' while were at it.People that are always watching you can't be trusted. They're not doing anything useful and present only risk. Increased risk increases anxiety, unease. Increasing anxiety and increasing population density can yield only one outcome.Look fellow gun owners--another double standard!Computers weren't designed to kill people though....Same exact logic applies to gun control. NRA has being saying that for years. So if we ban guns the good people will be the only ones that are affected? hmmm...EXACTLY the same reason DRM is bad.I am all in favor of pervasive encryption but this is a silly argument.  Most crimes are poorly planned if they are planned at all, and there is a good chance the the cops will find something on the suspects phone which will aid the investigation / prosecution.  We're not talking about terrorist masterminds, we're talking about some guy who texts his buddies about how he's going to kill his ex's dog, and then goes and does it.u can't hack me, I got Norton!!http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nKf2KtXnhB8/Uqfif1t8tBI/AAAAAAAABBs/nyIWLXCBXCA/s1600/hackers-gif-preparing-to-hack.gifApple is talking to the people, not the NSA and the rest of the government.  The government already knows this because the specific reason they want this is to spy on Americans, not terrorists.Welcome to the gun argument. "
"If you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns. Sounds exactly like the argument for guns. Just as valid too.Funny. This argument being used for phones and surveillance when it is a strong argument against overarching gun control laws and often dismissed.I wish this logic would be applied to gun control. Is he talking about encryption? Or gun control?It's the same thing with gun control^^this, but unfortunately I believe the stereotype demographic that would own a Mac would probably disagree with you. Not all of those, mind you, just the stereotype. I'm glad you see my point. Yea the typical stereotype wouldn't agree that's for sure. It's an interesting concept I like to think about. It's the difference between a good idea in theory and a good idea in practice. In theory, you have a problem. Either gun violence or criminals/terrorists being able to encrypt communications. How can we solve this? Oh by putting backdoors into encryption or by saying concealed carry for lawful citizens isn't allowed and all high capacity rifles should be limited to 10 rounds and have a fixed magazine. In practice this is horrible. A terrorist or criminal will find the encryption without a backdoor. Same thing for someone wanting to kill a bunch of people with a gun. So you say they can only have ten rounds and the magazine needs to be fixed? They can still quickly kill ten people. Not to mention the fact that guns and gun hardware is available anywhere. Someone looking to kill many people isn't exactly going to follow gun laws. They will just order that pmag 30 online. "
"It's ridiculous that people think outlawing or disallowing certain things that are readily available will prevent people that have already chosen to break the law from getting those things. Especially gun control. There are millions of gun owners in this country. Even more guns. By suddenly trying to control them out outlawing therm you are only putting law abiding citizens in danger. So lawful people will listen. But that guy mugging people doesn't give a shit. They will likely be even more capable to get a gun because where are all the guns people owned that are now illegal?This same argument can be applied to gun control.So kinda like gun laws? If you outlaw guns for the good law abiding citizen then only then bad unlawful people will have guns.This is a great analogy."
"Encryption : protection of data :: guns : protection from terrible people.This is essentially the same argument many make on gun control..."
"Gun laws only affect law abiding citizens because the bad guys are already cool with breaking the law.correct"
"the differences are many, however."
"everyone uses encryption in their daily lives, whether or not they know it. they only reason a guy sitting in grand central/times square with a wifi sniffer can't collect millions of credit card number is because of encrypted network connections. weakening the encryption used on these networks would be a serious attack vector that would make everyone vulnerable to these attackers."
"additionally, there is a significant gap between the average gun criminal vs the average cyber criminal. anyone using encryption in a nefarious manner is smart enough to simply not use government-broken encryption. so the ban is essentially worthless."
"people who acquire guns for nefarious purposes do not need any exceptional skill or knowledge to do harm with them, but acquiring an illegal firearm is an actual challenge that may dissuade the average dumb criminal. Except the facts simply don't support that statement. The vast majority of crime guns come from straw purchases/illegal transfers and theft. The laws on the books prohibiting straw purchasing and thefts haven't done a thing to stop these illegal gun transfers. I struggle to see how adding more words to a piece of paper will do anything to dissuade criminals...i agree with the overall argument that gun control is worthless and mostly ineffective"
"however i wouldn't agree that banning encryption is in the same league with strict gun control. i would venture to bet that at least one gun crime has been avoided simply by virtue of guns not being readily available by a would-be criminal. however, exactly zero criminals who use encryption would be stopped by a ban on encryption. a gun is physical equipment while encryption is something that can be searched for and downloaded within seconds.So wait, conservatives use this argument for gun rights and get ridiculed by liberals for being naive, but liberals can use it use it for internet privacy rights and its justified?Kinda like gunsThis could be a quote against gun control"
"The same logic applies to owning firearms, drugs, our rights, etc...I think this a conservative gun control argument applied to a different technology. If you outlaw guns, only law abiding citizens will stop buying them. ITT: every controversial comment is about gun control Just like guns. They know this, and going after the bad guys is not their true agenda. These same people don't understand this argument for more restrictive gun laws...Same can be said for strict gun control. Making it harder for a law-abiding citizen to purchase a gun does nothing to stop criminals.It definitely does.Well, just about every single other country in the world handily disproves that notion. Well, I might not quite agree, but I'm afraid to open up that whole can of worms."
"> Making it harder for a law-abiding citizen to purchase a gun does nothing to stop criminals."
"Have the lax gun laws made it easier to stop criminals?It allows more citizens to defend themselves; yes.Yes, which is why we need more conceal carriers.This same argument applies to gun control. It has been, is, and always will be about those in control retaining their control. There is a reason why there is a trope about hackers being the ones to free society from the bonds of government. This is strangely like that argument about banning guns to stop criminals.Funny, I use this argument to argue against gun control and get told that's totes not the same thing.Says the CEO of the company that ships a known-compromised version of OoenSSH in its latest OS and hasn't updated it.If you're talking about the SSH default keys, iOS doesn't ship with a vulnerability. Rooted iOS devices have it. Very logical. Sounds a bit familiar though, oh yeah, it's the same reason to not get stupid with gun control. Let's all clap and applaud Tim Cook for supporting public interests in privacy and then be totally surprised and outraged when it is eventually found out that Apple has been sharing our personal information with the NSASame thing with gun control and drugs.This is the exact same argument against more gun control."
"More gun control means you hurt the people who are law-abiding as the bad people already break existing laws and obtain their guns illegally. Except that you can't shoot somebody in the face with encryption.yeah but your kid can't accidentally encrypt himself in the head with the key you forgot to lock in a vault.funny - same could be said for gun controlWe have seen this exact law making philosophy when it comes to gun laws.  They don't care that they are only hurting the good people, that's the entire point of the legislation...His name is Tim Cook. Just like gun control!Isn't this the same reasoning people use to defend gun rights?  It seems to me you could replace 'encryption' with 'gun rights' and it would read the same.  I don't think this says anything about either issue, but I think it does say something about this argument, like, maybe it isn't all that sound.NRA or Apple. Sounds like the same argument.Yet whenever we apply this same logic to guns, reddit freaks out.Amusingly this is PRECISELY the same argument that Pro-2A folks use in regards to firearms!That's funny, this argument sounds similar to the one against gun control. Same argument regarding gun control. The other people know where to go: away from proprietary systems and companies which can be strongarmed by fascist governments like UK."
"Only open source community projects are immune. Immune? When possession or use of strong encryption can very easily be made a felony? You need to get out from the Open Source Will Save Us! lie. Stop being a fucking fanboy for two goddamn minutes. > When possession or use of strong encryption can very easily be made a felony?"
"Is it a felony to obtain and compile source, and install a firmware image? There is no such law yet. Even if it was: how do you even prove you're in violation? It's kinda hard."
"> Open Source Will Save Us! lie"
"It's not a lie. It's the only method that allows you to verify that a device is doing what it purports to be doing. Everything else is based on trusting other people, with no ability to replicate their work."

"You seem to have progressed to the bullet box already. Can't fault you with that, shoot the damn bastards while you still can.[deleted]Apple CEO needs to call it out for what it is and not pander to the dialogue. This is not about stopping bad people this is about circumventing well established Constitutional expectations. Apple CEO just needs to come out and say the governments excuse is bullshit and disingenuous.Holy shit, this is so fucking true.  More people need to understand this, instead of the neckjerk if you aren't doing anything bad, what does it matter? response.  The bad guys have darknet and deepweb connections where they can hide anyway.if anyone ever gives you the what do i have to hide? argument, just respond with this:"
"> Over the last 16 months, as I've debated this issue around the world, every single time somebody has said to me, I don't really worry about invasions of privacy because I don't have anything to hide. I always say the same thing to them. I get out a pen, I write down my email address. I say, Here's my email address. What I want you to do when you get home is email me the passwords to all of your email accounts, not just the nice, respectable work one in your name, but all of them, because I want to be able to just troll through what it is you're doing online, read what I want to read and publish whatever I find interesting. After all, if you're not a bad person, if you're doing nothing wrong, you should have nothing to hide. Not a single person has taken me up on that offer."
"Glenn Greenwald in Why privacy matters - TED TalkThis is true and the quote is great but I have to wonder what goes on behind the scenes.It's the same thing with DRM. It's only paying customers that ever have to deal with it because pirates just remove it.This whole argument they're presenting is basically saying we want to be able to raid houses of dangerous criminals easier, so we should ban door locks."
"It's so dumb and easy to see through that I really think anyone that actually buys it should be banned from ever voting again.What?  If you stop making it harder to do things, the good people will lose out as the bad ones already taught themselves to do the slightly harder things.  "
"...what?Ehh its all useless when the IT Vendors all allow backdoors for the NSA anyway.I love the fact that Apple is so strong on its stance when it comes to this matter. I really hope whatever comes next doesn't shake them from current their business policies. Working in the IT field for over 10 yrs. I can attest to that statement. I like the way he's ELI5-ing this one. "
"Bad things, good people. etc."
"This is the sort of thing we need, because governments will try to spin us out of our freedoms *democratically* by getting the ignorant to vote for bullshit.I love how everyone in here is so supportive of this statement but wont even look at the same argument for firearms.  In addition to that, banning encryption violates our right to free speech.I may be stupid to ask this but whats the long term plan. Whats their plan with motive with all this data what do you think they will do with the information?Not true at all. Many criminals use extremely unsophisticated methods to commit crimes...Oh yes, I'm sure the government wants to weaken encryption because it will help the good people in the long run. They're just misinformed, that's all! Give them the right information and you can bet they'll do the right thing! Honestly, I think that they can read encrypted data. Yeah, well, duh."
"If you remove your front door, it's not the burglars you hurt, but the people who live there."
"DEEP.Guys."
"Why is this a controversy?"
"Encrypted data is a fact of life. Federal and State laws will have to change to accommodate some hypothetical no more encryption political movement, one example being HIPPA. We effectively wouldn't be allowed to have electronic versions of patient data, which means no online/automated health-care services or health-care related services PERIOD."
"Also, encryption is merely a mathematical masking of data. Like, how can you be against that without being against things like compression algorithms. And who among us wants to outlaw 7zip?"
"To the informed, this issue is just non-sensical. Just a small point: the concept of digital backdoors has been around since way, waaay before Snowden..Thank you for that seriously obvious statementMight as well require all mail to be written on post cards as well. Federally implemented back doors are the same as someone telling you to leave your bedroom window unlocked. Stating, it's ok, we're the only ones who know about it.Honestly I have no problem for the government to spy on my internet/email/phone calls as long as they stop putting shit in my food and water and the air I breath....I find, that somehow, people who agree with this argument, tend to discount the analogous one for guns.Yes, so now allow there to be a GPGTools for iOS.This argument sounds familiar. Reminds me of the situation with immigration laws in the U.SWhy do we have to dumb down the argument to this level? Aren't the government helped by brilliant enough advisors?Encryption is a tool that ups an arms war of encryption/decryption. It can be used for good and bad. Not sure how having an unbreakable lock is somehow more good than bad or more bad than good at all.There are already end-to-end encryption services available for text messaging and VOIP. So how do they expect to halt or weaken these services? In those cases the only people who can decrypt the signals are the sender and the recipient.It's OK Apple, I've stepped my security up, Decoder Ring! Makes a bunch of sense doesn't it?"
"What benefit would the government get if they implemented wide spread monitoring? "
"They wouldn't catch the bad guys, they know how to get around."
"But direct advertising is pretty good reason eh? They know what you want so they give you ads for that stuff.this feels oddly similar to many things that are said in the debate on gun violence (not that i am for the people who want to put guns in every classroom or anything like that)I can't believe people are even *considering* outlawing encryption. I know lawmakers are dumb, but I didn't know they were *that* dumb...Silicon Valley should form its own country, or buy California and [secede from the union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secession_in_the_United_States). The tax benefits alone would be worth it. Slowly it could buy up other cash-strapped states, offering free education programs that fin in with an overall corporate agenda - giving rise to a new generation of scientists, leaders, and designers. As the old American Union slowly fades into obscurity, world peace will start to have a real chance.I see the echo chamber is still functioning.Typical politicians... If we make a law against something people will stop using it"
"We should outlaw cocaine. Oh wait....i.e. You have nothing to fear if you have nothing to hide.Unfortunately people don't feel that same way about guns yea, thats the point, retard - FBIIt's less about terrorism and more about affairs and strange porn. Im david cameron and I want to ban copy/paste in favour of sticking my penis is a pigs mouth please? See also: LawsSo Apple makes the 2nd Amendment / NRA argument and everyone is with them?Its true the FBI knows it too. The deep web is quite the place As someone going into network administration, I fear what this will cause if anything is passed to weaken encryption. So in other words the exact people who are being targeted....."
"Working as intended.I know he's not Steve Jobs, but I'm sure we'll all know who you are talking about if you say Tim Cook, lol.Quoting my network prof back in college:"
">For every lock, there is always a keyJesus Christ... Man in the middle attacks take zero effort if nothing is hidden!For once it isn't US politicians doing something stupid. Although I'm sure they're thinking the same thing. Been saying this about crackers DRM and piracy for years, exact same thing only people you hurt with draconian methods is the clean folks, anyone doing anything shady is generally going to be skilled enough that they can bypass your measuresEat shit GCHQ - I'm in Canada now!The thing is, there's no actual way to tell what he thinks."
"This is just the most profitable thing to say right now. He might mean it, or he might be saying it because he thinks it'll be a popular thing to say.Hate on Apple all you want, at least they're taking this stand.Which is of no concern to the people who want this. In fact, its almost certainly the entire motivation behind it.I've been saying for years that encryption, network security suites and certain types of hacking scripts should have 2nd Amendment protections. just be like FINE, NO MORE COMPUTERS THEN"
"After reading the article for the first time I am considering using Apple devices. So impressed.Wait, is this about actual computers, or a subtle metaphor from anti-gun control enthusiasts?He is absolutely right.Politicians don't care. They are paid but care. After all they are taught that they know better than everybody else.Wow - Tim Cook being smart.  Weird.First sense out of his mouthWow finally something useful from Apple. I didn't read every comment, but the overwhelming majority of the people in this thread have no fucking clue how this works."
"Data being secure and that secure data being untraceable by the government are sooooo different.What's the point behind weakening encryption? To make it easier to crack the encryption? A fucking no brainer. Might as well not encrypt at all. Could well make it to a modern-day Monty Python skit.Is it just me or does there seem to be a lot of similar rhetorical motifs between gun control and encryption policy?This logic could applied elsewhere also. Like on gun control.Only good guys with encryption can stop bad guys with encryption.This is my argument against gun controlSounds like the NRA but what do I know.If you make your devices closed source, the people you hurt are not the folks that want to do bad things. It's the good people. The other people know where to go.The exact same logic applies to citizen disarmament.This is why Tim Cook rocks. It's the same dumb government logic as gun control. Cook is a proud NRA member btw. Gates is a OBAMA loving hippy. Source? I don't know what Cook's specific stance on gun control is, but regardless of that I doubt you could really call him a conservative.You don't have to be a conservative to have a logical/non-fear based stance on firearms.No, but the rest of your comment seems like it is trying to portray him as more conservative than he is."
"I would still be interested in a source on him being a proud NRA member. I haven't been able to find anything googling around for it.Is this satire or can you come up with a source for Tim Cook being a member of the NRA?He assumes that the government isn't one of the 'other people'.No he's not. He's just being careful how he's framing the whole thing. He's not stupid. Perhaps. Maybe this would be better:"
"His statement implies or suggests that the government isn't one of the 'other people'.It sounds like he was telling a room full of 5-year-olds.All criminals are technologically sophisticated and all noncriminals are not."
"Simply not true.I remember years ago when I, as well as many others, looked at Apple as the epitome of evil corporation. Now that's quite far from the truth. I really respect most of what they've done in the past few years and the way they shaped their corporate culture is huge.If banning encryption will help keep bad people from doing bad things, shouldn't banning guns do it as well? Hell, why not just throw everyone in prison, because they just 'might' do something illegal at some point in their life.Hahahaha. Apple CEO doesn't have a name. Where is Google on this issue?Thanks for not circlejerking about apple.isn't that what they say about guns? In Australia, after a minor incident all guns are taken by the government and VERY few gun misuse and accidents are found. though I can't attest to the violence (sexual assault, battery, ...) being reduced."
"Though the transport of guns can be easily caught as Australia is a continent far far away separated by vast ocean. In America, it might be downright impossible. Where are guns manufactured and assembled anyway?I can build a gun in my garage in a weekend. 3D printing is a bitch"
"Strange. This is the same argument used by 2nd amendment rightists.Don't Apple and Google already have backdoors in their phones?Same argument for gun control. Apple only is interested in protecting rich people.  Can't have people of more-than-modest means being inconvenienced by being hacked."
"Exhibit A: The Fappening.  "
"Exhibit B: Their release of a crypto library that doesn't work.Wait, wait, wait, did someone from Apple say something totally correct?"
"To everyone that doesn't know how often you use encryption, everytime you see a https:// instead of http:// you're using encryption. You need strong encryption, because the bad people might want your info and with poor encryption and backdoors they are likely to get it, and then it doesn't help you at all that the government have the same info as the bad people."
"Also there are already really strong encryptions out there that the bad people probably already use, so a weak encryption only really hurts you.Great argument. Same argument for guns and bitcoin... and... everything."
"Same concept for gun ownership.This is the same argument against gun control. Imagine if the same logic was applied to gun ownership.Or RPG ownership, or tank ownership, or artillery ownership, or ICBM ownership...Private citizens actually do own those things... Although I'm not sure where one would buy an ICBM but the others aren't difficult to come by legally.You are being sarcastic but I don't think you realize almost no weapon is banned in the US. Just heavily heavily restricted when you get past weapons the typical man could carry.Outlaw both PGP and RPG!!!!! /sSo by your logic, you, a regular citizen, only need 8 bit encryption. Only the government should have the best encryption, because they are the only ones that can be trusted with it.I'm glad you now see how ridiculous it is to try and compare weapon ownership to privacy rights.  I wouldn't say it's ridiculous at all. The government has no business in what weapons I own, or what encryption I use.Privacy and guns are totally different.They are not mutually exclusive.  The 2nd protects the other rights.  The bill of rights is an enumeration of basic human rights, it's not a ranking of importance.What makes them different?Privacy is the the ability to think or perform acts in a setting or situation where information about these thoughts or events are inaccessible to others. "
"A gun is a device designed to hold,  and trigger,  a chemically,  electrically,  air,  or otherwise propelled projectile, at a remote target. "
"I already understand the technical differences, although I appreciate your response. I should have been more clear with my question. When it comes to government control of citizen activity, what makes gun ownership or use of encryption different? Why can this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/3sa38d/apple_ceo_if_you_halt_or_weaken_encryption_the/cwvdz94) get up voted, but some one applying the same reason get down voted?And yet both are considered basic human rights in the United States.I bet he hates gunsHe's from Alabama, so that's a big bet...Translation: I am saying this because it makes my company look great and the competition look like assholes. They can profit from your information and we don't. We profit using huge markups so we'll tell you that your privacy matters... unless we ever decide to make money off of your information. Then, we'll pull the fastest 180 in the history of anything. Oh, the government already has ways to get your info. We couldn't do business in the US if we actually blocked them.Says the company that uses slave labor, bloody minerals, and dodges all taxes."
"They are bad people, they just like to pretend otherwise.Dumb dumb here. What's encryption? "
"Edit: I'll Google it, but if anyone wants to tell me anyways I'll be forever grateful."
"Edit 2: Googled it and still lost. :/Encryption is used to secure information, often when sent to someone. If you want so send hello to someone and encrypt it, an algorithm will transform it so something like iwjqkiwnamk so that no one can see the content of your message during delivery. Only the recipient will have the counterpart to your encryption (like a key) to see what you originally sended. It's an important part of data security today and necessary to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks (systems that sniff in networks to get passwords out of the sent data)"
"If the government would force devices to have a backdoor, like a master key for the government to decrypt the data, they would be adding a severe security hole to the device, helping attackers to get your data. It's dangerous and stupid to go against encryption, since it's already hard to prevent hackers from trying to breach into your servers as a company.Its funny how this argument is invalid when it comes go drugs or guns. yeah, the government already knows where to go if they want to fuck over apple users"
"the engineers/programmers you hired, tim cookI know this is pithy and it's going to be front page material regardless of the facts but it's not actually true. I work in law enforcement and your average criminal isn't moriarty or even the villain in a typical law and order episode. I quite regularly find troves of incriminating evidence that they are carrying around for no reason at all. I once had a girl with a netbook who had an excel spreadsheet accounting for her cocaine sales saved to the front page without securing windows with any kind of password. Encryption saves these felons from their own stupidity. "
"In other words: *If I look hard enough, I can find something to charge anyone with, please let me look at all their stuff so I can charge everyone*No in other words if criminals were already encrypting their info then law enforcement wouldn't care since the evidence was already beyond reach. Reddit has this misperception that if it's common knowledge within the hive mind then it is common knowledge within society at large. It just isn't true. Most criminals talk to cops even after their Miranda warning. People give permission for searches all the time. Even when they are hiding contraband. "
"If the average criminal was smart enough to take sensible precautions he wouldn't be a criminal. The average criminal isn't encrypting, so banning encryption is a good idea......"
"Just because some people give up their rights willingly, doesn't mean you get to take them away from everyone.That's not what I said. There are very valid privacy concerns especially with so much data being stolen by online criminals. But this statement linked by the op is incorrect. > statement linked by the op is incorrect."
"The statement isn't about innocent people being arrested, it's about hurt. There are many ways that breaking encryption comes back to hurt the very people government is said to represent. From economic impacts, to social, and onwards."
"Who cares about criminals stealing data when the government is stealing so much more data as to make criminal efforts appear comicalCould you provide a link for more info on that case? It sounds like you're exemplifying small scale incidents to support a decision of societal scale. Who wants to talk? ;)"

"-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----Well that was annoying. The problem is of course authenticity :)The circlejerk is strong here on Reddit. How about a more nuanced, realistic take: Encryption has both good and bad consequences, as does government surveillance."
"I'll take my downvotes right here, tyvm.Since when did Apple Care about common folk?[deleted]> Until Apple goes open source they cannot be trusted no matter what they say."
"You'll be down voted to hell, but your right.Their programming language Swift is open source, among what others have said."
"Anyway, they'll probably open source OS X and iOS as soon as Microsoft open sources Windows and Windows Phone OS. Which is to say never.Based on your comments here the best thing I can suggest for you is to not use any technology. I don't know what you do on your computer that makes you so paranoidYour downvotes confirm it. Apple. You will die a slow and beautiful death. You used to be good. And then you turned that gold into shit. That is some accomplishment. You can't seriously be suggesting that the largest computer company open source everything. That makes no business sense at all. No company would do that. Companies open source things that they don't mind competitors having.opensource.apple.comTheir OS kernels have been open-sourced from the get-go, and they recently open sourced their crypto library."
"https://developer.apple.com/cryptography/That's right. Hate on one of the few companies that's publicly opposing this fucking insanity. That will make things turn out right! Step 1: Be Apple CEO  "
"Step 2: Say Something obvious  "
"Step 3:???  "
"Step 4: random person gets karma.  It's hard to believe Tim Cook could be so naive. Attempts to weaken encryption are part of a strategy for eventual political profiling so that this society of the rich can identify and detain people who oppose their agenda.Yes, created by the illuminati. Maybe, just maybe, his message was to the public, not to the people who know this. You can be sure that anybody who uses the word folks in a public forum is a sociopath.Built in back doors at hardware level in processors? if an apple ceo said you put 1 and 1 together and you get 2, someone would be highlighting this quote as a notable observation from the apple ceo.Apple not being evil? What? "
"Serious propsSame thing with the second amendment right to keep and bear arms."
"I am surprised that it took liberals this long to figure it out finally. Actually, it's funny you say that.  There's a rare but horrible virus that I've run across while fixing people's computers."
"Basically, it infects through an innocuous file and encrypts every single data file in your OS in 2048 bit asynchronous encryption.  Then, it says that it will delete the encryption key if you don't pay them $500 or $1000 in bitcoins within 6-12 months of infection.  It provides instructions on how to purchase bitcoins, how to pay them, and how to use TOR in case their site is blocked."
"So amusingly, his statement is not completely true.  Encryption is already absurdly strong as-is.  Honestly, there's not much you can do to actively weaken it.  2048 asynchronous can encrypt 1 GB/s under virtually unbreakable encryption.  Is there even a point in entertaining the notion that it could be weakened or broken in some way without the public key?  Brute forcing the key would take millions of years lol.  At that point, the only weakness of encryption is the human element.Except even if us non bad actors don't have that level of encryption, the bad guys will still find it because *somebody somewhere* will ignore the laws and create stronger encryption. So your entire scenario doesn't even play out any differently.I fail to believe he really gives a shit given that Apple work for the intelligence servicesPlease, please don't downvote me because I do believe privacy is very important and shouldn't be compromised. But I cannot be a hypocrite and accept this reasoning because it's the exact same logic that gun nuts use to argue for looser gun laws. Banning guns hurts the good guys because the bad guys will still know where to go to get them anyways.the differences in these arguments are many"
"not everyone uses a gun in their daily lives. in fact, 99% of people do not. however, everyone uses encryption in their daily lives, whether or not they know it. they only reason a guy sitting in grand central/times square with a wifi sniffer can't collect millions of credit card number is because of encrypted network connections. weakening the encryption used on these networks would be a serious attack vector that would make everyone vulnerable to these attackers."
"additionally, there is a significant skill gap between the average gun criminal vs the average cyber criminal. anyone using encryption in a nefarious manner is smart enough to simply not use government-broken encryption. so the ban is essentially worthless."
"people who acquire guns for nefarious purposes do not need any exceptional skill or knowledge to do harm with them, but acquiring an illegal firearm is an actual challenge that may dissuade the average dumb criminal.Well you can argue that banning guns still makes it harder for gun nuts to obtain guns. And for guns, it's not just 'bad guys' who are the problem. A lot of accidents are caused by innocents owning guns, police carrying guns, kids taking guns to school, mentally ill people; these people are not in the category of 'terrorists', they are not necessarily the people would still know where to get a gun."
"The same is not true for privacy. Encryption is extremely easy, banning it makes no ounce of difference to the difficulty of encrypting messages for those 'bad guys'. > But I cannot be a hypocrite and accept this reasoning because it's the exact same logic that gun nuts use"
"So you don't agree with it because it sounds similar to an argument about another completely unrelated topic? That's some terrible logicIt's really not, if an argument isn't valid, it isn't valid. Context is irrelevant in socratic method.What an incredible generalisation So what reasoning do you use to stop the government from abusing its power?That's kinda the point.  When everyone uses PGP, it's really hard to sift through all that info and find the bad guys.  If only criminals use PGP, then you just find PGP users and you know you're going to find something in their ranks quickly and efficiently.If Encryption is removed from the face of the earth then what happens to those emails sent from the US to China that negotiate a way to crush the Russian economy forcing them to beg the US for help?  "
"That email is now free for anyone and everyone to read.  "
"How about those communications which could be so secret hidden from the public for years and years which has now been stolen by some 14 year old hacktivist proving that Bush ordered Bin Laden to blow up the towers then thought shit we need someone to blame and cover my ass... Saddam/Osama did it!.  "
"I hope the government understands that if they remove encryption all their stuff could effectively be laid bare to the public and any other nation intent on digging up some secrets to force politicians  in to bend over backwards to help avoid tax etc...  "
"Ask yourselves this? Are you fully prepaid to disclose every last moment of your life online? Are you willing to show that saucy text you just sent your wife to the public?  "
"Well thanks for the downvote. Maybe explain why?Theres already backdoors in Apple products just for the NSA. "
"Call it *conspiracy* until the next Ed Snow if you want.  Prove it? You're saying the NSA can break AES? No there aren't. And how exactly would you know?They aren't *direct* backdoors made specifically or in conjunction with the NSA. But just like MS, they often leave known vulnerabilities in their software, and share that information so that they can put their hands up in the air should something come back around. This is what we call the 3 way hand shake. it's funny that is's the apple CEO who's saying this."
"since apple product are known for their good security.If that's sarcasm, they actually are pretty good with security.Its crazy how people think encryption protects them, the NSA controls so many nodes they can middleman any password they want no problemo.How?? What good people need encryption the government cant access when the person is under arrest... ya know, for nothing. I dont need to encrypt my bank info, or my WoW login info, or my credit card statements, or my SIN number, or like whatever the hell else people think they need to encrypt. "
"Can anyone give me some examples of non-tinfoil-hat things people legitimately  need to encrypt that arent incriminating? medical records, banking information, sensitive business documents, legal correspondence, personal familly issues, Tax info, basically anything you wouldn't want to paste to your front window for everyone to see"
"think of anything you would mail that you wouldn't want to just write on the back of a postcard (which anyone can read and roughly equates to an unencrypted message).Naw, thats hardly comparable. "
"A) There is no post man delivering my emails by hand and for some reason curious of my personal business. "
"B) Why do you have your medical records / digital medical records?"
"C) Why do you have your banking information on a computer? "
"D) Sensitive Business documents almost works, except any company with business documents worth looking at have an internal network and business infrastructure. Not personal use. "
"E) Your criminal record is accessible by anyone who wants to know. And its not like they email you your charges... so this isnt even a real thing."
"F) Personal family issues falls under the mailman thing. "
"G) Assuming you do your own taxes and would have that on your computer, uh who would give a shit? What are they gonna do with that info? Not to mention the flawed logic there. If someone is taking an interest in you enough to hack your computer/phone then they already know you make money. They arent going to hack you and be like oh man, tax info! This looks interresting!!. "
"People mail almost everything you listed above *every day*. Legal documents, tax info, bank information, business documents, and *especially family issues*. Medical Records are probably the only thing shared digitally, and even then you get your health card in the mail. "
"The only thing anyone encrypts are nude pics, and assuming you have them legally then there are much better ways to hide them. Look man I gave you a good answer I don't have to make you accept itThats true, but my reply wasnt so much for you as for anyone who reads it. But thanks for the answer, even if I disagree. privacy isn't about what you have **to hide** it's about deciding what you want **to share**Wording something to sound dramatic doesn't change the reality of the topic. The average person doesn't encrypt shit and they're fine. The only thing strong encryption protects are criminals. "
"Also, you're computer is fine. You a aren't important enough to worry about it. If it da real concern people wouldn't have had to brute force celebrities iTunes passwords to leak their nudes. "
"Gotta be realistic about this. He also said  The PC is dead. You shouldn't necessarily listen to this guy. "
"Not that I'm for weakening encryption...Well, yes, that's marketing. He's not going to say Windows is doing amazing! as CEO of Apple.It's such a shame Tim Cook of all people has to say this. Apple is pure evil, I don't want them making sense.leave and never return please."
"how is he evil?It's Apple. They're the closest thing to a real-life SPECTRE. Why do you even ask?Just because Apple products are generally sold at quite a high price and are very closed doesn't mean that they're evil.That is *exactly* what makes them evil.Evil, or just unappealing to you? Because I don't see any problem with selling those items unless they have a monopoly, which they obviously don't.wow nerdittors praising Apple.. next step: cops for doing their jobOh please, Tim Cook is just pandering like politician.  something something something ANDROID IS LUITERALLY HEAVEN AND APPLLE IS OUT TO RAPE YOU.The government needs to make strong encryption illegal. There really is no need to have strong encryption unless you have something to hide, i.e. criminal/terrorist intent. Also, by forcing weak encryption, this allows intelligence/law enforcement agencies the ability to more easily discern between legal and illegal activities. Terrorists/criminals will continue to use strong encryption and this will make them more easy to track.Weak encryption doesn't just let the good guys in; it lets the bad guys in as well. That's the problem. If you pass laws that say nobody's allowed to lock their doors so police have easier access, criminals have easier access as well.That is a small price to pay to prevent another 9/11 or something even worse. Also, the government having more access to data will make it easier, not harder, to capture the criminals you are talking about. Weakening encryption can only be a net positive overall so it is a good trade off.Weakening encryption can only be a net positive"
"So you're okay with anyone being able to read your credit card number when you make a transaction?  I don't understand. There are many types of information that I'd like to keep secure."
"I do have something to hide: my money from criminals accessing my online banking. And if that happens, you can easily get your money back, but if another 9/11 happens or worse because terrorists can easily communicate over any network, then those lives lost can't come back. Also, government having more access to data will make it easier to capture criminals stealing your information, not harder.I hate Apple, but just this once...amen.Coming from Apple, this is hilarious. What? Apple seems to be the only one standing up against the government for encryption. While other tech companies (i.e. Google and Microsoft) are being very quiet about it. apple wants end to end so they can control you like they do all there users"
"Well by that reasoning I guess my bank controls me because I use https...>Apple CEO: If you halt or weaken encryption, the people that you hurt are not the folks that want to do bad things. It's the good people. The other people know where to go."
"What about the good people, for some reason or another, are about to do bad things?"
"They make up the majority."
"People are not born hardened seasoned criminals, they are made."
"The governments reasons for snooping is to stack the deck in their favor, to catch the newly Breaking Bad types before they reign a lot of destruction."
"I don't mind the government snooping because the government works on the rule of law. What I don't like is when corporate leaders feel they also can do the same thing, profit by it and in the meanwhile blow a lot of hot air about how they are defending their users when in reality they are not."
"Like Tim Cook is really going to throw in for all the users and allow potential terrorists a means to communicate without their encryption being broken. Yea, right. "
"And since one cannot tell the good from the bad guys, or when the good guys turn bad, then everyone gets snooped on regardless."
"I would be just glad if Tim Cook would stop all the Apple spying and tracking that Apple is doing themselves without the governments intervention, it's not like they need the money."
"Innocent until proven guilty is an decidedly American tenant. Not only are you assuming people to be guilty before providing any evidence, you're already willing to knowingly violate the rights of more innocents to find this evidence. It's people like you who will bring about the police state. "
"Better hope you never disagree with the government, or piss of a rich guy.  maybe some evidence happens to find its way onto your computer. It's really that easy. We found child porn on his PC.  And you just disappear. "
"And you're *asking* for this. Why? Because of the one in a million chance you'll get shot by a drug dealer or a terrorist? Your more likely to drown in your bathtub, or die falling down the stairs. These enemies of yours are imaginary."
"I assume this means your for banning all guns? And for outlawing personal cars, soda, cigarettes and beer?>I don't mind the government snooping"
"Just think of the time when the people in power are not the ones you agree with, and how they can use and manipulate your data to make you conform. it sucks that people like you existThis guy is a frequent contributor to r/applesucks. I think we can safely say he's not looking at the situation very objectively.Probably an nsa shill :p"
"Apple CEO: If you halt or weaken encryption, the people that you hurt are not the folks that want to do bad things. It's the good people. The other people know where to go.>Halt encryption"
"Literally the dumbest thing that anyone could ever think of. It is the core element of network security. Without it, there is no such thing as secure communication over the internet.It's all fun and games until someone in power gets their iMessages sniffed on a public network.More like the password to their bank account.I agree with him. If you outlaw encryption, only outlaws will have encryption. I've heard the exact same argument used with 'gun' in place of 'encryption'. Of course, the key difference is that one protects your property with deadly force, while the other protects it with passive force.Sounds like a familiar sentiment. Yet the government has no problem regulating weapons. I'm not a gun advocate necessarily but it seems like common sense to me that when you outlaw anything you just create a black market for it. Same argument for the second amendment.Sure. But we'll be able to crack the encryptionSame argument is used by pro gunners about gun control. Ban guns, only criminals will have guns. What about guns?Like gun control. The NRA can use this exact slogan. 'If you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns.'And then yay the rest of us who use encryption to be secure will be monitored since we would be indistinguishable from the outlaws  Just like with gunsWhen did politicians start believing that making something illegal will stop criminals... they're fucking criminals. If they didn't want to break the law they wouldn't be criminals in the first place. Boggles my mind."
"Better not encrypt my coke trafficking operation... because that's illegal.... Wat!If we outlaw encryption, we will no longer be able to exchange commerce on the internet legally.Except thats a good thing for them because there's less encrypted traffic for them to filter throughWell that's the technical term.Encryption is never going to be outlawed. People don't understand that Encryption is not something you do when you go to your underground layer. Encryption = Internet = Gaming = Cars = Airplanes. You can't simply stop Encryption....Encryption is Love Encryption is Life. This is the same argument used by pro gun individuals in the US. It is just as relevant in this situation. I wonder if he agrees that same logic applies to gun control. Not really comparable. I don't need to go to a store to buy encryption - nor can I read a book and magic a gun out of thin air."

"You could download a gun :)http://cdn.project-disco.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/YouWouldntDownloadACar1.jpgyeah you actually can. Im pretty sure people were freaking out over a 3D printable one called the patriot.[Liberator*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberator_\(gun\))close enough lol :)Guns aren't magic. You can build a rudimentary one relatively easily. [This](http://www.northeastshooters.com/vbulletin/threads/179192-DIY-Shovel-AK-photo-tsunami-warning) dude made an AK almost completely out of a shovel with basic tools. You can make a simple shotgun out of a nail and two pieces of pipe. Most gun designs that are considered modern are from the 60s or before, newer guns just iterate on those same basic designs. No, he built a receiver, which is the easiest part of an AK to build. Now let's see him build a barrel and a bolt.He built about the same percentage of that gun as someone implementing a cryptographic package built the encryption. He also didn't mine the ore to make the metal. You'd be surprised how easy to is to encrypt something well starting from scratch, and you'd be similarly surprised how non-functional a receiver is without a barrel and a fire control group, let alone a bolt.I'm a sysadmin for a living and I own several guns including a few that I put together, so I wouldn't be surprised by any of those things. Bolts aren't hard to come by in this country, neither are barrels or fire   control groups. The engineering specs for all those things are also no more a secret than the math that you need to encrypt something. I imagine homemade bullets are a lot harder to make.The bullets themselves aren't the hard part. For bullets you just make a mold, melt some metal, and pour it in the mold. They're just a solid piece of metal. The hardest part of making a fully functional round is the primer, because it requires very precise work. But knowing that, you could always modify the design of the gun you're making to use rounds that don't require that sort of primer, if you know you're going to be making your own ammo from scratch. Do you not also need to make gunpowder? Sounds quite complicated as compared to downloading some encryption software.you don't really even need gunpowder, but you do need a method of propulsion.It's all about skills you already have. It's easier for someone who is on here already to encrypt something using their computer, sure. But people, say where I grew up, out in the sticks. A lot of them already know how to make black powder. Smokeless powder is harder, but from what I know black powder isn't that hard and people still use it to hunt. They don't make it themselves because they can buy it, but a lot of them know how. Those people on the other hand would have a much harder time properly encrypting something and an even harder time actually coming up with encryption themselves. It's more about the materials you need access to. Yes some people might know more about manufacturing certain physical items than how to program or use software. "
"Point is the only physical materials you need to do encryption is a general purpose computer, you can't deny that's a whole lot easier to get than the tools and materials necessary to make a firearm."
"No, but you need materials as well as the instructions to make a gun."
"To use encryption you just need the equation. Computers make it faster, but you could do it by hand it you really wanted to (I wouldn't recommend it).To use encryption effectively, you need a computer. Nobody is SHA512 encrypting an entire message by hand, except cryptographers maybe. You also still need instructions to encrypt something, you need to understand math at a high level as well as knowing the algorithm if you're not using a computer. If you're using a computer, you need to know how to encrypt the message and how to send it, plus have the software to do so.Gun materials: Gunpowder and household junk + simple knowledge.  "
"Encryption materials: Computer and education + complex knowledge.  "
"Not a big barrier to entry for either.But they're not talking about outlawing a specific set of encrypted data -- they're talking about outlawing encryption.  That's like outlawing the knowledge of how to make a gun out of a shovel with basic tools, NOT outlawing the gun itself."
"Which makes enforcement something that belongs to the Thought Police: I see that you're doing something with that data that sure looks like it is transforming it into something unrecognizable.  I don't care if it's your bank account number or the plans to a secret airplane... what you're doing is illegal and must be stopped!"
"Here's another thought: what's the difference between encryption and encoding in general?  Are they going to make binary blobs and network level compression illegal too?  Because strong compression is indistinguishable from strong encryption.A nail and two pieces of pipe aren't thin air."
"Encryption is also less likely to prune you out through natural selection when you accidentally make a pipebomb and trigger it next to your face.You don't encrypt things out of thin air either. Unless you're literally doing the math to encrypt and decrypt something yourself, which the average person is not doing or going to do."
"Edit: effectively encrypt I should say. You can technically encrypt something with a caesar cipher easily without a computer or some other hardware, and it would be broken pretty much immediately. People didn't used to send bullets going 1500-2500 feet per second, until somebody thought up the gun. Your argument is like saying You don't shoot things out of thin air. Unless you're literally throwing a bullet 1500-2500 feet per second to cause damage to something, yourself, which the average person could not do."
"Of course they can't. That's the point of a gun. Likewise, calculating by hand RSA encryption has little practical use. The technology that actually *enacts* RSA encryption is very useful."
"Just because some individual cannot do it themselves, doesn't mean there isn't a solution that does it, or does it very, very well."
"That's really what is incredible about being human. If you have a problem, it's very likely that it's been solved, at least to some extent. If you're resourceful enough, you can take hold of that solution. Somebody's already out-thought you and figured out how to solve the problem. You just haven't found that solution, yet.> You can build a rudimentary one relatively easily. This[1] dude made an AK almost completely out of a shovel with basic tools."
"lol yeah, all you need is a full metal shop with a forge, a magazine, and the ammo. So easy! That's why, as we all know, criminals make their guns instead of buying them from straw purchasers.People are so far removed from how things work it is hilarious. That forge is some concrete sitting over top of some brick and with fire inside. Magazines (not clips) are just bent metal and a spring. The ammo is the hardest part to make yourself, more specifically the primer, but you can still do it. High-quality firearms were being manufactured long before steam engines were invented. do you know how many shooting sprees have been committed by people with home made guns in countries with stricter gun laws?[deleted]Compared to the rest of the civilized world it's the largest factor."
"Is mental health an issue? Yes. Media coverage? Yes. Preexisting crime rates? Yes."
"Does making it harder to get guns have a more immediate effect? Overwhelmingly, yes.Well it's a large part of it. You do know that In most of the shooting sprees that occurred in states with gun control, the guns were obtained in states without control, right?It's certainly a big factor.I think Americans fail to understand that *guns* aren't the American exclusivity, *gun violence* is."
"Guns don't kill people, but people without guns don't shoot people.Although to be fair the entire point of this comment thread is that if you outlaw X, only the outlaws will have X the point is there won't be a place where people don't have guns to shoot people. The whole concept is that isn't possible. You just create a place where only the criminals that want to shoot people have guns. "
"Criminals have guns in both scenarios, the difference is that law abiding citizens don't. None because there's no point for now. If you banned 100% of all guns, that's when you would see homemade guns, just like you already see homemade bombs. No amount of legislation can prevent people from killing each other. Humans are too fragile.I don't recall seeing any homemade guns while in the UK. You can still get guns in the UK. You can get up to a .22 rifle in the UK for pest controlYou mean [like this?](http://imgur.com/MkJSRRB)"
"That is a .22 I bought for my dad for his birthday.So I've always considered myself more on the anti-gun side than the pro-gun side but I understand that complete prohibition won't work (just like with drugs and such), but I've never really seen an argument that adequately explains a responsible pro-gun opinion (ie a good way to have pro-gun [rights] legislation while simultaneously reducing gun violence). Do you have one/know of one? Not trying to be a dick or anything, just would like to be more informed on the topic.Yes, we need more conceal carriers, and we need to get rid of gun free zones. Think about it, what is the one thing that stops an active shooter? Police right? Well how do they stop the shooter? They shoot the shooter... with a gun. You could argue vigilantism should be left to trained adults, but conceal carriers go through mandatory training already. And people practise shooting guns all the time for fun, so it's not like accuracy would be an issue. [There are already many examples of people taking down shooters with their own guns](http://www.personaldefenseworld.com/2015/03/10-cases-where-an-armed-citizen-took-down-an-active-shooter/#10-cases-where-an-armed-citizen-took-down-an-active-shooter-2), and since conceal carrying is getting more popular, I expect to see more stories of people preventing or mitagating shootings.Ok fair enough but a lot of people (myself included) are just uneasy with the idea of anyone being able to have a gun on them. Like there are a lot of people who would pass a screening process but could still have crazy anger issues (ie road rage).  I know they are definitely a huge minority and 99% of gun owners are responsible but that 1% scares the shit out of me.Here are some statistics that should make you more comfortable then."
"Gun ownership is already common. 1 in 3 people own guns. You've gone your whole life surrounded by gun owners."
"Everyone aside from convicted felons are already allowed to have a gun on them. Everyone can already transport guns in their car. We bassically have unrestricted access to firearms in this country, and we haven't descended into anarchy. Anyone who wants to kill people already has unlimited freedom to pick up a weapon and kill people, yet it's extremely rare. "
"Relative to other ways to die, guns should be the least of your worries. If you're confident enough to get on the freeway, there's no reason to be scared of guns. Over a million people die a year to car accidents. About 10k die a year to guns. I just don't understand how it's so scary. I'd be more worried about a bad diet than guns."
"Crime is at an all time low. You're living in the safest time in american history, and our gun laws have only been getting more relaxed. Gun laws used to be really restrictive, even in red states because people feared black people. Over the past 50 years, we've made huge amounts of progress in expanding gun rights, and we're only getting safer. This is actually a terrible argument. One would expect most shootings to occur via large-scale manufactured guns because there are far more of them and in the USA they are (for people who aren't good at DIYs) actually easier to come by. Make store bought guns illegal long enough and you won't be surprised to find out how many more murders there are committed by home-made weaponry.None, because why would you make an inferior product to do the job of a superior product that's easily obtained?What's your point? It's obviously still possible to acquire mass manufactured guns in those countries, and that's far easier than making your own. But if literally all guns were outlawed and unable to be acquired, then you can bet people would make their own guns.> http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2015/08/11/mystery-9mm-machine-pistol-seized-europe/"
"Soon, many."
"The Charlie Hebdo shooters didn't even need to make their own, and that was in France.ask chicago.None, they use either the guns they can still get or other means like arson/bombs. My point is that guns aren't magic. They're made from pretty basic materials. Funny you mention that.  In recent months police agencies have been finding these mysterious fully automatic machine pistols all across rights restrictive European nations...  http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2015/08/11/mystery-9mm-machine-pistol-seized-europe/"
"The origin of the pistol is still unknown.Oh what a shocker, criminals can get guns even if they are banned!"
"I don't understand why its so hard for people to understand this. [deleted]One thing I find very curious is the fake manufacturer markings.  If they are fake, then why bother doing the work to make them?  Is there some sort of underground product market to the point where there is brand recognition or something?I'd imagine so. With out some sort of name you're gonna walk up to your underworld gun dealer and ask for the black one with no name. It helps give a way to reference it just like people brand their weed or other drugs. So you know your getting the same thin you ordered before.I could make a bomb out of stuff I can buy at the hardware store. But we don't have complete assembled bombs on the shelf for sale because this would obviously lead to more bombings.The exact same logic applies. Both are tools that law abiding citizens can use to protect themselves and their privacy, while they're also capable of misuse by criminals. Any kind of ban only applies to law abiding individuals (by definition)."
"The only differences appear in their perceptions. One person might think Yes! Outlaw encryption because I don't have anything to hide while another person might say Yes! Ban guns because I don't have/like/want one.A gun is a phyical thing. You can't read a book and suddenly have a gun in your hand, or download ammunition."
"Encryption is an algorithm, a numerical recipe. A more apt analogy would be banning the recipe for gun powder and claiming this will stop terrorists from shooting people.would you download a bullet?The difference here is that it is literally impossible to outlaw encryption. Anyone with basic computer literacy can set up encrypted communication no matter how much the government tells us it's illegal. It's just math.We just have to encrypt guns and then guns are impossible to outlaw. Checkmate.The difference here is that it is literally impossible to outlaw guns. Anyone with a 3D-Printer or lathe and basic machining skills can make a gun, no matter how much the government tells us it's illegal. It's just fabrication.It's baffling how much Reddit loves to believe and enforce their echo chamber. What you said is entirely accurate, and yet they seem to think it's incredibly easy to just find a CS major who will encrypt stuff for you. I bet it's easier to convince a local machinist to break the law and make a gun than to convince a CS major to do it. But all it takes is a couple people downvoting you to hide your counterargument and help them maintain their hilariously ignorant confirmation bias. It's equal parts funny and sad.But you only need a few CS majors for everyone to have encryption."
"Also the encryption export bans didn't work either.CS majors are people, not vending machines. Not everything uses encryption, and it isn't suddenly going to start if it becomes illegal.What are you trying to say here? I honestly don't get how that applies to what I said.>find a CS major who will encrypt stuff for you"
"Why would you need to do that? There are loads of extensions and add-ons that allow you to use encryption by literally just clicking a few buttons:"
"[Virtu email encryption](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/virtru-email-encryption/nemmanchfojaehgkbgcfmdiidbopakpp?hl=en-US)"
"[Encipher It](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/encipher-it/fimncfoplhkgepigcpgjheeccdhemcfj?hl=en)"
"[Cryptocat](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cryptocat/gonbigodpnfghidmnphnadhepmbabhij?hl=en)"
"etc.It's a sad day when reddit has fallen so far that its users think running a few GPG commands requires a CS majorI mean, not necessarily a gunpowder firearm, although that's not *that* complicated, but everyone and their mom can make something deadly with much ease. Encryption, though, that shit is mad science to the overwhelming majority of people.But you don't need to *create* the crypto, merely download software. The issue isn't that the technology is trivial, the issue is that it's merely information and can be freely transmitted, copied, installed, and used by anyone. "
"Guns are tangible property, so while it's certainly possible for people to exchange the commodity, it takes a good deal more effort to acquire an illegally made or smuggled gun than to download freely available software. "
"Think about the protest aspect as well. If all guns were outlawed and collected, it would require a pretty substantial effort to distribute guns to a major share of the population. But digital revolutionaries need only publish openly licensed open source software from an off-shore server to completely subvert the ban... and the entity engaging in this protest doesn't even need to spend a lot of money or risk prosecution."
"Finally, consider enforcement. Exactly how would a ban on encryption be enforced? To know there is encryption at all, the government entity enforcing the ban would need to intrusively monitor billions of digital communications devices on a fairly constant basis. But if the crypto is any good, it would be nearly impossible to even detect in the first place, whereas a gun would become fairly easy to spot the moment it was used. So while enforcing a ban on guns would probably be difficult, enforcing a ban on cryptography would be literally impossible. You don't need to be a CS Major to set up some encryption software. You just need to know how to use Google and have the ability to read for about 10 minutes. That's a lot less skill than 3d printing a working gun (which you still have to buy the ammunition for from somewhere)Wasn't there a design on the internet a bit back for an m16 that is good for a few hundred rounds."
"So technically anyone who is good at google fu can make a gun.Yes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DconsfGsXyA"
"They get to about 30 rounds in that video but I assume they've made more progress.Oh this is what we're gonna do today? We're gonna fight?This is just a wild guess, but I'd say computers/computer skills are a bit more common in the general populace than machining equipment/machining skills. Also bullets.I am actually very pro-gun, but I really don't think it does any good to bring it up in this situation. The UK (which has already essentially outlawed guns) now wants to outlaw encryption, and my point is that no matter how hard they try, they will never be able to outlaw encryption with the same effectiveness that they have outlawed guns."
"The UK hasn't outlawed guns or anything like it. It has LICENSED guns and there are over 1.8 million in private ownership. Thats a lot for a country of 65 million where guns are supposed to be outlawed. "
"Millions of people in this country have fired weapons you're not even allowed to as a civilian in the USA such as fully automatic assault rifles. By the age of 14 I'd fired everything from a .22 rifle through to a 7.62 GPMG, the British equivalent of the M60, and a 40mm Bofors anti-aircraft gun."
"Shit if I want to fire a gun here in England without a firearms license I can walk half a mile to my local gun club any weekday night, pay a PS4 non member range fee, pay for my ammunition and use one of their club target rifles.You can own machine guns in the USA. It's complicated and like everything else, partially state specific, but you can.The principle is the same for both, the difference is that encrypting something takes literally millionths of the effort machining a(n effective) gun does.One time pads are dead simple and can be done using pen and paper. So long as the key is random and never reused, it's an incredibly strong system.That doesn't make it impossible to outlaw it. At all. It makes it impossible to eradicate it. "
"Which is also true of alcohol, drugs, guns, and basically any other highly marketable thing. Outlawing them does not make them go away - except in the hands of those who revere the law above all else i.e. *not* criminals.>That doesn't make it impossible to outlaw it. At all. It makes it impossible to eradicate it."
"Sure, a semantic error. You knew what I meant."
">Which is also true of alcohol, drugs, guns"
"Encryption is different from these things in that it is not a physical, tangible thing. It is essentially just an idea. A government can no more prevent multiplying two numbers together than they can prevent encryption (actually that's really all [encryption](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(algorithm\)) is). I agree that drugs and guns cannot truly be completely eradicated, but they can be to a much greater degree than encryption can.And to take it a step further, if you know the the government is looking for encrypted traffic, you can start hiding communications inside other data. For example, I wrote a working program that let me hide the entire text of the Neuromancer inside this image:"
"http://i.imgur.com/hR1dRZB.png"
"Granted, this is not the actual image file, I used a bitmap (which would be considerably larger in size) but it *can* be done. You'd never know there was any information hidden unless you knew specifically *where* to look (it is possible to find it, see if you can!), and even if you found it, you'd still not be able to read it unless you had the encryption key.ELI5, where is the data in this image? Sounds really coolIt's called [Steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography) and it's pretty cool.It's hard to get a true ELI5 explanation, but bear with me. "
"Any computer image is nothing but a huge array of pixels. Each pixel requires a certain amount of data to accurately convey color. In this case, each pixel uses three bytes. This is called 24 bit color mode. Each byte consists of eight bits. (8 bits *x* 3 bytes = 24 bits). What I do is take the least significant bit of each byte, and set it to one bit of payload data. You are left with an intact image that is visibly indistinguishable from the original. The payload data can be arbitrary, but in this case, I included an encrypted, compressed text file of the story The Neuromancer."
"The amount of data you can hide is determined by the geometry of the file. Let's say you have a 640x480 bitmap. Each pixel needs three bytes, and each byte can hold one bit of payload data. So... this bitmap would be approximately 921 KB. That means, I can hide 921 Kb (kilobits) or 115 Kilobytes. You can hide a LOT of data in 115 kilobytes.Thanks for that explanation! I suppose you don't even need a reference image to determine what data is there so long as you know the image is carrying a payload.Correct. There is a fixed scheme for how the data is stored. If you supply the correct key, it will be there. If you don't, you'll never be able to distinguish what's there from background noise.To elaborate (someone correct me if I'm wrong), the data being hidden in the picture is only a layer of obscurity (not encryption). It's like hiding a box in the bushes. "
"He mentions that, once unpacked, his payload is encrypted. So it's like he hid a box in the bushes, but also put a lock on it. Now someone would need to find the box AND have the key to unlock it."
"This distinction is an important one in cryptography because simply coding your payload into a picture like that could be easily intercepted if anyone ever deciphered the process (in this case, to look at the least significant bit of each byte).Comparing encryption to locks is misleading.  Encryption transforms the data.  So it's more like he took a box and stuck it inside wet concrete molded into the shape of a rock, and then  hid THAT in the bushes.  Now someone needs to find the rock, AND know that there's something inside worth chipping away at it to get."
"But you're right: steganography requires the original content be properly encrypted (such that cryptanalysis doesn't find any non-random repeating features) or else discovering the encoded content and then reversing it becomes trivial and can be automated.I mean the same applies to every illegal act. They've banned certain things but they keep getting done by the criminals who don't care about the law. Murder is illegal but that doesn't stop hundreds from being murdered every year. Drugs are illegal but that doesn't stop literally anyone from getting and using them. "
"Banning encryption only serves to make the innocent more vulnerable. Correct. You cannot uninvent something that already exists."
"It's staggering how many people I speak with that do not get this simple idea.Guns have been invented, yet are illegal in many countries. Same with cocaine. Right, because it's so hard to get cocaine or guns in countries where they are illegal.As is marijuana.If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns. Yeah but you cannot un-invent a gun or cocaine. People still use guns and cocaine even when illegal.Encryption algorithms are widely available (you can download from another country or ask an CS undergrad to code one up for you). At least with physical goods you have a chance at restricting access.So... basically.. Personally encrypt shit you want to keep private? Isn't this a given? Anyone who values encryption can't trust a corporation that is also lobbying for something else. If they want it bad enough, they'll sacrifice anything provided they can still deny it. "
"Sure we can trust Apple, Google or DroptoNSAbox, but that is just ignorance. Look at The Fappening.. Look at Google. They're a company that started off based on AD revenue.. You think your personal information is something they want locked away and inaccessible? Like discovering a inhabited continent Tell that to the war on drugs. I'm just saying. This is Apple we're talking about. Nothing is invented until they invent it.>  You cannot uninvent something that already exists."
"Counterargument: Like crypto, child porn exists and can be copied at zero cost, but banning it reduces its availability to everybody, including the criminal element."
"So banning stuff, even trivially producible stuff,  often works OK.>It's staggering how many people I speak with that do not get this simple idea."
"I get it, but from a certain perspective it isn't. "
"For many American's (or, humans in general), their exposure to technology isn't from a position of an informed consumer."
"Take for example: "
"* Verizon Wireless has a new ad that touts 50% less cost for their 'XXL' data package."
"* Fine print: 'compared to the next lowest tier'"
"Wat. Da. Fug. That's just one example. "
"Reddit, especially /r/technology, has a user bias as most users are embraced to modern technology, more informed, and passionate about keeping it free."
"That's not the case elsewhere."
"Look at Comcast. They own media outlets for a reason. (Granted, many reasons...). Imagine being able to influence people across multiple media outlets, while at the same time creating artificial limits in the communication pipelines (the internet) to boost profits. "
"So when it comes to things like cybersecurity, encryption, etc., how can we expect the average citizen that can't program their own DVR to understand it?"
"I passionately think (speaking as a US citizen) US citizens need to know more about encryption, don't think I'm arguing anything different."
"The way technology is changing, the population body really will have a hard time keeping up. As we approach the 'AI bubble' where algorithms and slick programming are going to start replacing jobs, we talk about it and it's exciting but we often forget something: **We're not telling people to stop getting degrees in areas that are going to get replaced; on a larger scale, we have no plan for what to do when thousands and thousands of jobs are replaced**."
"The other day I saw a machine that was flipping a sign. Yep. They automated the need for a sign flipper. Then we start thinking about automation in bigger categories. Fast food. Trucking. Driving. "
"Point is, all of this stuff is changing and we really need to understand that the population majority won't understand it. At that point something like encryption becomes an argument of Aren't you tough on crime?. Same reason bills like the Patriot Act pass. It's not patriotic. It's just a name. If you don't support it, YOU AREN'T A PATRIOT."
"You don't support banning encryption? YOU SUPPORT CYBERCRIME."
"Fucking awful. "
"The thing that's kind of more ridiculous is the existence of one-time pads.  Trivially simple encryption that's also perfect, and works just fine for digital messages or written ones.  They DO require organization though.So you're saying you can't put the shit back in to the horse?I don't see why a skilled surgeon couldn'tIt's the same impulse that leads to echo-chamber rejection of any other culturally scary ... well, anything.  The Good People Like Me in a safe camp with the warriors guarding us, and the Bad People outside worldview is probably genetically embedded, and it's behind a lot of this. Intelligent people's brains shut down when they're scared, too."
"Same with gun control slowing down crime to an extent. Maybe the petty criminals but anyone that would want a gun could get one I think the difference between encryption and guns is that with guns, not everybody wants to use them. Of those that do, not everyone is going to have the time and inclination to become competent in their use. They say that if you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns, but in many areas that becomes a near reality even without laws banning guns. Those that do tend to use them in crime, often crimes of passion."
"But with encryption, at the very least, every time you buy something on the Internet, you're using encryption. I can only imagine what other legitimate uses mandating backdoors would endanger.That doesn't mean you can't make it harder for people to get."
"I don't think you should halt or weaken encryption, but I don't think the then only the bad guys will have it argument is the best route."
"I think it's better to compare it to locks. People need locks for many reasons. Weakening locks would make the entire nation less secure.That's a really good analogy. Nobody'd be stupid enough to say We need to ban padlocks! It must be easier for law enforcement to get inside a criminal's house!, and yet that's exactly what an encryption ban is.They'd only insist that the government gets to have the master key, which also shouldn't happen.The issue is that locks can be broken with enough resources, while properly built encryption is totally secure regardless of the money you throw at the problem.Like those TSA locks?"
"Yeah, they are a master keyed system, and people have reverse engineered the TSA master keys because you can get a large enough sample at any hardware store.Are we talking about guns or encryption?Both. Trying to completely ban/outlaw guns is beyond retarded, same goes for encryption. The desire to outlaw them, and most other things for that matter, is based on irrational fears and boogeymen. Only violent criminals and nutjobs use guns! Civil people have no need for tools of destruction,  Only pedophiles and people who commit crimes want encryption! Civil people have nothing to hide!.I think after the fappening  the public would be more aware of the need for people other than terrorists and pedo's to use encryption. "
"I don't want it to be difficult for my doctor to adequately secure my records. [removed]Thoughtcrimes.They've tried that with drugs, guns, and many other things. They can't even keep them out of prisons. Banning objects works just as well as banning knowledge. I do find it somewhat ironic that this issue is important to the redditing community at large and therefore the same anti gun control message is used- which reddit is largely against. "
"Outlaw X and only criminals will have X. Works in so many cases and is probably the best emotional appeal for an issue.> Outlaw X and only criminals will have X. Works in so many cases "
"Works in all cases. "
"> is probably the best emotional appeal for an issue."
"No emotions; only facts and logic.I don't really agree that it's an emotional appeal. It seems like a logical appeal to me because it logically follows that criminals won't obey the law and such laws will only harm law-abiding people. The difference is that Reddit sees encryption as benefiting everyone, while Reddit sees guns as not benefiting everyone."
"I'm not here to argue about guns, but they're right about encryption.this is the first thing i thought of when i saw that headline. same argument about guns.is gun control a major issue among the American prison population?  No. But a few still find their way into inmate hands every year. "
"My point is that prison is literally the most controlled environment that most people could ever be exposed to in the US and they can't keep contraband out of the hands of the prisoners. Even if we all lived as prisoners, we would not be able to completely solve the problem and I don't think that anybody is willing to live their entire lives on lockdown. No but drugs are.The whole scenario really makes me think back to a book i read in high school called Harrison Bergeron. You can't control the idea of encryption since it is just math. It is like legislating stupidity.[Harrison Bergeron](http://www.tnellen.com/cybereng/harrison.html) is actually not a book, it's a short story by Kurt Vonnegut! You can draw a lot of parallels between this and [Export Grade Cryptography.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FREAK)It has been a long time since i was in high school. looks like i remembered it being a lot longer than it was.Especially when the thing that exists is just math.And in some form or another has been around for 1000s of years. The Romans used primitive encryption for their military communications. "
"Anyone that's suggesting banning encryption is a grade A moron. Any politicians doing should it be removed on account of mental disability. They're not fit to run a lemonade stand, much less a government.I have found that drugs are fairly effective in undiscovering math. I've found the opposite. Amphetamine has turned me into a math/programming boss.[removed]I'm a professional methematician, and this joke is soooooo old. (but that won't stop me from using it)Using what? Meth or math? Maybe both? But if you stop using math for  meth then how do you know if you're getting ripped off.When you get into the really complex stuff, ma/eth cease to be differentiable. Tried it once in high school. *MAN* was it ever trippy. Never again. I'm done with derivatives.The cynical part of me says that the government knows this already, and it's not the terrorists' data they're after. Terrorism just gives them a nice excuse to ban encryption so they can spy on all of us. Look into the history of communism over the past century and how the U.S. dealt with it. You get stuff like the Red Scare, Bay of Pigs, and DOZENS of Democratically-elected Communist governments. Basically, Terrorism is the new Communism and we've been fed a crock of shit for decades. People are still falling for it. The Military-Industrial complex is very real, it's not some conspiracy.You should append more easily, because that's the issue. Not whether they can, but the resources required.They do.  But if you make it so only terrorist can use encryption, legally, it sure does make it a lot easier to spot the terrorists!you mean the realistic, sensical, logical, and historically-referencing part of you? that part is smart. listen to it.> Terrorism just gives them a nice excuse to ban encryption so they can spy on all of us."
"If they ban encryption the entire banking industry will grind to a halt. It's required for communication and secure data storage.While I think so too, it's not right to think that way. It's like saying all terrorist are perfect and that they will never make a mistake. The more info the government has the more chance they have of catching a mistake. I don't agree with that but you're argument for it is not goodEveryone always assume conspiracies, but in honesty the best way to do bad things is to find **true believers** and then direct their outrage to benefit yourself."
"Kind of the entire background of organized religion being created.Exactly. They know full well this won't do shit to help against der turrists, what they're after is control. Full control over everyone."
"Politician up-and-coming that might rock the boat and upset corporation's profit-making ability? Well let's just dig up their browsing history and smear them with some kinky shit they looked at 5 years ago. Suddenly they're unelectable!/r/conspiracyNever waste a good tragedy.Im probably going to get shit on for saying this. But this is the same Exact principle to gun control. It's different, and the comparison is disingenuous. "
"For one thing, control implies regulations. I don't think anyone thinks there should be no regulations on guns or encryption. So this would only work if discussing a ban on encryption alongside a ban on guns. And that's not even close to the discussion on the table; it's always been about the degree of the regulations."
"More than that, all things equal, they aren't. Encryption is far more important to liberty than guns in the modern era. Guns are a method, one of many, of protecting yourself. Encryption is the only method of protecting digital information, and information is everything; it has every piece if meaningful data on everyone on the planet. It's the largest violation of freedom in history."
"And lastly, defiantly saying that gun bans would never work because guns already exist is foolish when you look at nations that DO have a ban on guns, have low crime, and 1/4 of the homicides the US has."
"I'm not arguing for a gun ban, but trying yo say it can never work is retarded when you consider it exists and it works.  You can say it's not for us; fair enough. But don't say it's an inherently flawed practice.But there is no regulations on encrypting. I could encrypt any data I want in couple minites.Im more interested in what the non-cynical part of you says?That they're really just that stupid. 'The government' or elected officials? The latter makes policy, and can be astonishingly clueless.Thought police, crime prevention.its a sad state of affairs when cynicism and realism are indistinguishable.> The cynical part of me says that..."
"I don't think you're being cynical at all, given the bills they're trying to pass and the businesses paying government to push these bills.There is nothing cynical about your line of thought. This is exactly the case. For Your Safety is the oldest line in the book.That's hardly cynical. There is no shortage of unambiguous evidence that this is exactly what government wants. I remember reading somewhere a while back that the NSA still bulk stores encrypted data they can't access and then they come back and crack it years later once they have the computing power/ability to do so.Unencrypted data from Americans is on a rolling deletion cycle. If they don't receive a warrant within 30 days (IIRC) it's flushed. "
"Encrypted data is stored indefinitely, but there are not attempts made to decrypt it (computationally infeasible) unless they receive a warrant. And even then it should be computationally infeasible to decrypt. That would be in no way unsurprising.meanwhile, if you ban real crypto, people will buy from someone who doesn't. the rest of the world is getting real tired of our shitEven more cynical:  They know there's nothing to find and don't give a shit, but expanding data collection expands contracts and budget."
"Ultimately government should be a way for me to legally redirect public money into my pocket.> expanding data collection expands contracts and budget"
"The main aim is and always has been financial gain, but not though bloating, try fraud. If you get wind of an upcoming windfall e.g. an oil company finding a new field then you can invest in the company *before* the knowledge becomes public. A form of insider trading for all extents and purposes. "
"There are also dozens of proven cases going back decades when these spy networks have been exposed as being used to steal technologies and to get an advantage in trade negotiations. The infamous 2001 EU Parliament report into ECHELON details them and that's what was known about 15 years ago!"
"All of this stuff *pre-dates* the fascination with the War on Terror by a long-shot. Economic espionage has traditionally been the primary function of spy networks. It would be naive to believe this has changed. Security theater is an incredibly lucrative business."
"The NSA's primary 'function' aside from that is economic espionage, as it also spies on foreign countries.And the TSA's primary function is as a federal jobs program.Give a man a fish, feed him for a day.  Give a man a TSA screening job and improve employment numbers for low-skilled labor! Can we just pay them to pick up litter on the side of the roads or something like that? I feel like that would improve the populace's lives much more than what we're currently paying them for.I say we pay them to make art. Paintings, music, dance, Youtube tv shows, whatever they might be good at.  At least there is some evidence that exposure to art reduces criminal behavior, unlike TSA searches.there is everything to find out. a complete record of everyones lives. the amount of money you can extract from this is infinite. insider information in every market, deep knowledge in human psychology. a complete sample size for advertisers. the possibilities are endless."
"then the pervs get all their sexts. "
"they arent doing it for no reason. no one does something for no reason.Ah, the Iron Law of Bureaucracy: An organisation will always put its interests ahead of its goals. And another top quote. This thread is a goldmineIt's the first thing I was taught in management 101: the primary goal of *anything*, including any group, is self-preservation.Some of the government might know this and are tricking the parts of government who don't know."
"Always assume your politicians are clueless and keep sending them knowledge whenever it looks like they're ignorant.UK's minister of internet security used to work in Google AND FacebookWhat particularly objectionable things has Joanna Shields been responsible for?The fact that there are so many documented examples of rogue agents conspiring to commit criminal acts within an agency using the agencies' resources demonstrates that this is possible and probably likely. "
"Just humans being humans. Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.Hmmm, where have I heard that before? Yet that's just not how reality works.A good quote, but more of a general observation than an actual rule. You honestly think the NSA, our fucking intelligence agency, is just straight up ignorant? Bullshit. This is not ignorance, this is control. Nobody in power wants an informed public. Let alone a public with the means to defend themselves. Yes, your normal day to day politicians might be clueless but not our intelligence agency. "
"Edit- I'm a dangus and flew right past the UK part but the point remains. Top people in power are not idiots or ignorant. They are well informed. "
"It's a big club....and YOU AIN'T IN IT!-George Carlin> You honestly think the NSA, our fucking intelligence agency, is just straight up ignorant? Bullshit. "
"The commenters above are not referring to the NSA, but to politicians in general. It was suggested that the most likely case is that a subset of people in government want to deliberately spy, and the rest of the politicians just thinks they're doing the right thing, as told by the smarter/more powerful people. The NSA was never mentioned.I still have a hard time believing that the majority of politicians are unaware of the ramifications of all this. They may be outta touch with some issues but not when it comes to the subject of power, influence, and control on a wide scale.[deleted]But blatant ignorance is intent.[removed]I'm on your side, but I think saying our lives are at stake is a little hyperbolic. Plus, that's the type of fear-mongering we're trying to combat."
"edit: In case it wasn't clear, I'm on your side. As in, I'm for encryption and think it's important for protecting privacy, which, again, I'm for.If someone stole my identity they could pretty much steal my life along with it.Many medical devices we use on a daily basis rely on encryption. If that encryption is compromised bad actors could potentially gain access to things like medicine pumps, heart monitors, and many other devices. Lives aren't always at stake, but it's hard to say compromising encryption doesn't at least make us less safe in life threatening situations."
"Source: work in healthcare information security.This, also every Tesla on the road as well as every piece of farming equipment and grid connected power station. If we open ourself up to low grade encryption we give ourselves to whomever wants to hack and take us over.I managed to convince my mostly computer illiterate grandparents by comparing encryption to bank vault."
"A strong encryption is the shinny 2 ft solid steel door with all the fancy lock on it at the bank down the street."
"A weak encryption is like the wooden front door of the house."
"No encryption is like the public park across the street from the bank."
"When you have sensitive or highly valuable stuff, do you keep it on the bench in the park, a closet in the house, or in a locked box in the bank's vault?"
"And now they believe encryption to be very important and the government is been stupid.I prefer a safe, an envelope and a postcard."
"A safe has a lock and a combination that can only be opened with the combination or a lot of effort. This is like strong encryption."
"An envelope is openable by the government if they want but there are rules saying when they can and can't do it. There's also very little protection against a criminal who gets into your  mailbox. This is like a government backdoor."
"A postcard is public and readable by anyone who can see it. It's not necessarily plastered on billboards but anyone who handles your mail can read it  easily. This is no encryption at all.Haha. Yes, that does sound like a closer analogy. It was spur of the moment, and we were just at the bank. So that's the only analogy I could thought of at the time."
"Oh well, it worked, so that's all that matters. :PYou could use an analogy with only a safe.  Imagine a super secure 2 feet thick steel safe with a high tech ultra secure unlocking mechanism that's unlocked by some sort of iris scanner or facial recognition technology.  The only persons that can access the safe are those authorised to be able to open it by the scanner.  However the safe also has a shitty traditional pin tumbler lock and master key that overides the high tech scanner so that the government can come along with their master key and check you're not keeping anything they disapprove of in the safe."
"So what happens when some nefarious person comes along and decides they want access to your safe?  They obviously cant abuse the scanner to gain authorisation without another authorised person present, so the only weak point of entry is the shitty traditional lock.  Being a knowledgeable person on how such locks work, they know that there are several methods of entry using just the vulnerabilities of the traditional pin tumbler lock.  They could try and find a way to obtain the master key, but that's unlikely to happen.  They could drill the lock open and try to gain access to the inside of the other locking mechanism but this may be too much of a brute force approach that damages the higher tech lock, but it might just work.  They could however learn to pick locks and simply open the lock with a simple lock picking set purchased from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/GOSO-Piece-Lock-Pick-Set/dp/B0079IKMX6).  Even locks that are designed to defeat lock pickers can be overcome by someone who who [reasonably practised at the art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI7Lx-73lU0).  Lastly, they could find out what sort of key is required to open the lock and then manufacture what is known as a bump key that will [open up any lock of its type without even having to know what the original key looked like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=131j0htYIoU).  "
"So yea, not only has the addition of a master key rendered the high tech lock useless, but its also given a way of entry to anyone with a bit of technical know how that doesn't even require access to the master key.That is way too much information and fancy high tech stuff for my grandparents. LOL. Years of dealing with them has taught me that - when it comes to technology, keep it simple, keep it something they can relate to.What If Apple would just stop selling their products in the UK in th event of an encryption ban?considering Apple products are popular in the UK and the UK is a major market for Apple i am guessing they won't.Who would win, in that situation? No one.I know that Apple is too greedy to lose on UKs worth of sales..."
"[But *if*.](http://i.imgur.com/SZAXMD7.jpg)That cash that Joker is burning in that picture is absolutely nothing compared to the cash that Apple could burn. "
"Apple has approximately $250 billion in cash. "
"Scale wise, that's roughly 2,000 pallets of cash. "
"They could lose UK sales for a couple years and be totally fine, they wouldn't even blink. Apple does have ~~millions~~ billions in cash to fall back to."
"And who wouldn't love to see some riots in London over no more iPhones?"
"But yeah, everyone does lose.206 Billion actually, but yea, they won't pull the product, but they might get creative about it.Apple. Riot different.This is truly the most innovative riot yet.It's beyond innovative. It's ... *revolutionary.*It would probably cause enough public backlash to get the government to reverse its decision.One election cycle is all it would take. The politicians who made the law would be booted from office. Politicians against the law would be voted it. The law would disappear. Apple could sell their phones again. Everyone wins.Except for the massive loss of sales by Apple, it's gonna hurt Apple a lot more than the UK and there's no certainty it would take one cycle, that's just your prediction."
"Edit: I'm just pointing out it's not as simple a decision as this looks, there is potential losses/gains no matter what direction they go unless certain political action is taken.I personally hope that if Apple has any respect for the privacy of its customers, they would stop selling the products, and release a statement as to why they came to this decision.http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2127048/Apple-6bn-UK--paid-10m-tax.html"
"This article indicates that about 10% of Apple's revenue comes from the UK. That is quite significant, but considering what a firm position Cook has taken on this issue I would not be surprised if Apple pulled out of the UK rather than backdoor their products. Pretty old article 3yrs~. I really doubt it's that high anymore because Apple has expanded to several more markets since (namely China). Accommodating the UK regulations would be expensive and potentially damaging to the security of their services in other regions (you can't remove end to end encryption from iMessage in just the UK). So I could definitely see it being more worthwhile for Apple to pull out of the UK to at least some extent. Think of all the good press and publicity they would get. Wouldn't they just disable iMessage in the UK? Seems to me that this would be the most reasonable thing to do. I truly hope this would happen - if only to see Cameron backpedalling like the clueless cunt he is.You wouldn't see that happening. He'll come out with some BS exception or something but he won't admit he was wrong in any way.Please don't disparage cunts by comparing them to David Cameron. They already have enough problems in this world to deal with, being cunts and all. Excuse me, I take offence it that word. Please use asterisks at least next time, like D\*\*\*d C\*\****n.Dhunter2d Chunter2nI know, so offensive."

"[deleted]TIL I'm a bad people. Obviously the government know that. Tim is saying this to inform the average citizen. The gov says they *need* to spy for their safety, and Tim is pointing out this isn't the case, and will only work against the average citizen.Tim knows that too. But he can't just say it that way. He's doing the best he can to retain our right to encryption. Good guy Tim CookWhat I really like is that Apple put a 'canary in the coal mine' with a statement on their webpage saying they have never surrendered data to a government agency (paraphrased). I believe the thought is that they aren't allowed to keep it unless it's true, and since they can't reveal a secret court order, they're giving a warning if they remove it. Quite a few websites do this, actually:"
"https://canarywatch.org/Tim Cook can and has been [saying it that way, to anyone who will listen](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/10/01/445026470/apple-ceo-tim-cook-privacy-is-a-fundamental-human-right):"
">I don't think you will hear the [National Security Agency] asking for a back door. ... There have been different conversations with the FBI, I think, over time. ... But my own view is everyone's coming around to some core tenets. And those core tenets are that encryption is a must in today's world."
">And I think everybody's coming around also to recognizing that any back door means a back door for bad guys as well as good guys. And so a back door is a nonstarter. It means we are all not safe. ... I don't support a back door for any government, ever.So this is why Tim Cook has been getting unwarranted sheit, all along? He doesn't want to get in line with backdooring and general security dismantling?I'm pretty confident that he's familiar with backdooringIt's funny because he's gay"
"Samsung's CEO is even more gay. And waterproofFor the record, anyone who doesn't use Apple products or has a Jihad against them: I've been able to format my Hard Drives using AES encryption for years, and when you reformat a drive it gives you three options in OS X.  Quick format which just writes over the old information, full format which writes 0s over every block on the hard drive before formatting it, and an extended format that will write random bits of data all over the hard drive and wipe it 7 times before formatting your drive.The formatting on osx is nice. When I sold my MacBook, I just picked the option to wipe three times because why not. Took 3 hours lol.The write 0 option is all you need. There has been ample research that it's impossible to recover data from a drive wiped like that.Actually, if that drive is encrypted and you erase the keys then all data will be no more then noise.True. How hard is it to brute force the keys? Serious question. I imagine the NSA has farms of systems designed specifically to brute form through encryption.Breaking it through brute force would be impossible, as in, the universe would undergo heat death before then even if you combined all of the computing power worldwide. Their only hope would be to discover and exploit a weakness in the encryption algorithm.> How hard is it to brute force the keys?"
"As shown above, even with a supercomputer, it would take 1 billion billion years to crack the 128-bit AES key using brute force attack. This is more than the age of the universe (13.75 billion years)"
"[Source](http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1279619)Don't forget, they can store your data and decrypt once quantum computing is viable. That might take a while, but when storing seriously incriminating stuff, this might be important.> Don't forget, they can store your data and decrypt once quantum computing is viable."
"AES is not vulnerable to quantum computers. Well, slightly, using something called Grover's algorithm, but doubling the key size will easily stop that.Quantum computers can't crack AES256, it remains strong even against Grover's algorithm For an encrypted hard drive, simply overwriting they key is sufficient. But 7 times man!then microwave it.  Thanks Mr. Robot.I accidentally chose this option when formatting a 300gb partition on an external hard drive. It took 14 hoursThat's the standard for many organizations and even the govt so I can see why Apple would support it. In reality a simple override with 0's is more than sufficient. Worked for a company that refurbished gov't/university computers for use in high school and elementary schools. "
"The gov't drives were often wiped once before sent to us and then we had to reformat them using the 7 write process. Took forever on mechanical hard drives.> Quick format which just writes over the old information, "
"Actually quick format just removes the directory entries that tell the drive that there's something there. The data is all still there, untouched. This is absolutely true, which is why I actually like the extended format options on OS X.  I usually just go for writing 0's because the extended format takes something like an entire day, but I totally appreciate having the option.I'm a linux sysadmin."
"Without strong encryption I have no idea how I'd do my work on a day to day basis."
"I'm pretty sure if the US outlaws encryption for everyone, then tons of companies will move to a country where it's legal."
"Are they going to outlaw it for personal use only and force everyone tech savvy to incorporate themselves? That's also silly.Don't be a pussy and just telnet.  Correct. And we have enough flaws in our security now. Weak encryption makes hack almost trivial. The government are the ones spying. The way this sentence is laid out, they are the bad people. What's the point in telling them this?Victim disarmament.If Apple really wants to get the message across, they should refuse to sell Apple products in the UK if they implement this. Make an example of them. When 60 million people can't get access to their precious iPhones, they'll start screaming at the government and the government will back down. And Apple can afford to forgo UK profits for a time.[removed]I've always thought of it like this."
"Trained robbers rarely bust down the front door. They get in through weaknesses in the building and surgically collect the cash, then get out as quietly as they entered."
"The government would rather bust down the front door and case the joint just to make sure you're not up to anything.The government would rather forbid you from having a door, actually.I will try a slightly different angle on why they want this. This is about being lazy. The government wants to leverage you against you when you do something bad. This is a nice way around the 5h amendment. "
"The FBI might be the front for this chatter on the hill but they are not the ones crying like babies. That is the DEA. The DEA had grown accustomed to wire tapping every one and any one they liked if they could even vaguely justify involvement in drug activity. These people hired IT people finally and no longer use standard level non-encryption to communicate.  They use end to end encrypted iMessages. This is why they are hell bent on bringing down iMessage. The DEA does not want to use human intelligence they just want to go back to the old way they worked which is skim and exploit you agains you. "
"This terror smoke screen is that a smoke screen. "
"I am now putting on my tin foil hat, and say once they have this massive data bank who is minding the shop so to speak. Once you have this data how will it be used if your not subject to a current investigation. This is where they invoke the secrets act.

I am also aware that the UK could be a bell weather for where america wants to go. The Five Eyes arrangement makes it too likely that expanded surveillance powers in the UK -- where they already record *all* Internet traffic under Tempora -- can be used against Americans via intelligence sharing and parallel construction. Something scarier than the NSA is the NSA minus the Bill of Rights, and there is such a thing: GCHQ.Well that is trueAaaaaaaaaaamen.  "
"Organizations under the governments, like the CIA, FBI, NSA, already know this.  Our leaders are either naive or evil enough to believe it.  A-fucking-men. Laws are not there to stop the law breakers. Law breakers don't care about breaking the law."
"It's the UK government to be specific. They are not to be trustedInformation gathering is not to counter terrorism it is to get an advantage in economy. It has nothing to do with fighting terrorism Ten bucks says he won't apply that logic to guns.If you outlaw guns, then only outlaws will have guns."
"Well, duh.[If you outlaw encryption, only outlaws will have encryption.](https://xkcd.com/504/)It's pretty fucked up companies are trying to protect us from our governments. It should be the other way around.You can replace the word encryption with the second amendment and still have a true statement.   As a matter of fact, the first amendment would also be an appropriate substitute. Finally, something from Apple that I can get with! Apple CEO..."
"You mean Tim Cook?OP: He who shall not be named...How many people off the street would know who that is though? It's better to make it easier for people to recognize."

"You mean the CEO of Apple?Apple CEO..."
"You mean Tim Cook?Yes, the CEO of Apple is in position to be Tim cook."
"Wait a minute....WTF? Why am I seeing so many comments about gun control in here? It's not even remotely close to the same issue. If I owned a gun, there's no way a government or other entity could spy on me with it."
"As soon as we allow one person in through a back door, it means criminals can get through it to. There's no point in twisting that analogy to work with guns because computers can't kill people (unless it's a big server and falls in someone).Because the If you outlaw encryption only outlaws with have encryption is a verbatim argument against gun control if you replace encryption with guns. This argument is super common among gun control opponents.ITT: gun controlThis is EXACTLY the same argument that can be used ANYTIME a government wants to use to ban anything. If it has a good side and a bad side (which everything does) then someone in government wants to take it from the people. Bad people will be bad no matter what the government does. except in this case, the solution being proposed would do literally nothing to hurt criminals. they would simply not use algorithms that have a backdoor."
"for the average person, this is a nightmare scenario. breaking encryption is essentially a nation-wide enforcement of compromised internet connections for individuals and businesses. "
"on top of that, the government would have full plaintext access to all communication sent by any entity using a device in their jurisdiction."
"> Over the last 16 months, as I've debated this issue around the world, every single time somebody has said to me, I don't really worry about invasions of privacy because I don't have anything to hide. I always say the same thing to them. I get out a pen, I write down my email address. I say, Here's my email address. What I want you to do when you get home is email me the passwords to all of your email accounts, not just the nice, respectable work one in your name, but all of them, because I want to be able to just troll through what it is you're doing online, read what I want to read and publish whatever I find interesting. After all, if you're not a bad person, if you're doing nothing wrong, you should have nothing to hide. Not a single person has taken me up on that offer."
"Glenn Greenwald in Why privacy matters - TED Talk*drops iphone*when they talk about banning encryption what does it actually mean for someone who isn't computer savvy? Do they mean anyone can read my emails and messages etc?It basically means if you ever thought about starting a company that helps people who have had identity theft it's becoming a really good time to do it.so, then we all have to become criminals with the knowledge to encrypt our own phones. "
"we all go to jail>not enough jails and building them seems silly> everyone on lifetime house arrest>still go to work/school/hang out and live our lives because they still need people to turn the wheels and press the buttons, but under FULL surveillance>3 meals a day and full medical care provided at tax payer expenses>It's like requiring that everyone have no locks on their doors by law. Criminals will have clandestine locks installed and be safe. Law-abiding people will be in constant danger and have their homes trespassed into all the time by criminals.This is the same paradigm with the war on drugs."
"Simply outlawing and maybe adding stronger punishments does not give the government control more control. In fact it does the complete opposite. You lose control of what you are attempting to control.'Good people', have morals, morals are anti-government..100% true and accurate. If you halt something that is mostly used by good people, to protect themselves, the bad guys will still be able to hurt them."
"Sound familiar?"
"I was legitimately flabbergasted when I read this headline. I thought to myself....this is exactly the same point with law abiding gun owners.This is the same for gun laws.Could we not replace the word 'encryption' with 'firearms'?Exactly like gun laws.  Thank you for making a great parallel.  It's almost like the same argument with gun laws ... Take away guns from everyone then only the bad guys have them and not the good .Maybe Apple can put some funding into https://letsencrypt.org then. 2nd AmendmentThose who would give up essential liberty, to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety."
"-- Benjamin FranklinI think this can apply to weapons tooIsn't this the same argument with guns, drugs, and prostitution?Gun Control LogicI'm not really sure what this quote means.  it means anyone who is going to use encryption to evade the law will do so whether or not the encryption used is illegal."
"outlawing encryption or weakening it with backdoors severely hurts people who want to protect their personal identifying information when, for example, shopping online or accessing personal accounts from their mobile device. "
"compromised encryption can be exploited very easily for the benefit of hackers and identity thieves. in the security world, if an encryption scheme is  even suspected to be weak by some attack, it is essentially sworn off and replaced by a more secure algorithm. government-backdoor encryption is broken by design and is a joke in the security community. it's ludicrous that this is even being proposed let alone discussed in a serious manner.sounds like gun controlWhy does this sound like the anti-gun control argument?Same thing with gunsSounds like the argument for guns. Funny that we accept thus argument for encryption, but not gun control, especially with the advent of 3d printersSimilar argument to be made for overreaching gun control?[removed]Yes. Especially in the US as we already have 300,000,000 firearms in private hands. If you banned them tomorrow the criminals wouldn't turn theirs in and it would take probably 50 years to make a good dent in the illegal firearms. If you banned guns tomorrow, 99% of law-abiding people would also not turn them in.    > If you banned guns tomorrow, 99% of law-abiding people would also not turn them in.    "
"That's an oxymoron. I think it is understood to what I meant.  If you want to be technical, fine, 99% of law-abiding people would suddenly become criminals because they wouldn't turn them in.  Shouldn't the second amendment apply to encryption? Has anyone tried to make this argument in court? It doesn't seem like such a stretch of logic, if you think about it.I think the 1st Amendment is all we really need to defend encryption. The founders even used encryption when they sent letters (hiding messages in code). "
"You can't ban speech except in cases where it endangers others like screaming fire in a crowded theater or telling everyone to kill such and such (ex. Hate speech). Encryption by itself is neutral. It would be like trying to ban a language just because only a few people can read it.  "
"The only reason encryption used to be restricted was because it was classified as weaponry/state secrets and the 1st Amendment doesn't give people the right to endanger the nation by exporting/selling state secrets. However that argument is dead since everyone has encryption now. Restricting big companies from including high-end encryption for their customers doesn't change the fact that they can get it elsewhere. "
"Terrorists don't need iMessage and I doubt they trust it anyways. When they are building bombs or buying weapons do you really think they aren't buying military grade encryption? "
"> A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."
"Arms seem pretty ambiguous so maybe. But then again, that could also mean background checks for the use of encryption, just like people want background checks for the use of guns. Or maybe, just like you may need a permit to carry guns, you may need a permit to use encryption.It definitely seems like a huge stretch of logic. The second amendment deals with a completely different subject matter. Both encryption and arms are tools to fight tyranny. I think it's a valid comparison. I guess the logical step is akin to how patenting something people do every day in the physical world, but on the internet is absurd. So why do we draw a distinction between being armed in the physical world, vs arming oneself on the internet?[removed]The 1st Amendment and 4th Amendment seem to apply much more clearly here."
"1st -- no abridging the freedom of speech -- i.e. I can send you encrypted code, or whatever else I want."
"4th -- No unreasonable searches and seizures -- i.e. privacy against their reviewing my communication for code/content they don't like.I've never thought of it like this. Have an upvote No. It cannot; they are different entities with different uses with different reasons for existing with different abuses."
"It's like comparing oranges and rocks.[removed]There are similarities in the argument, but no similarities behind WHY you would make that argument, nor the objects being argued about."
"It's like saying training your dog to pee outside makes life easier, so you should train your kid to pee outside.> There are similarities in the argument"
"Isn't that literally what the person you were responding to was saying? Exactly, came here for this.  The only caveat is that if your kid accidentally gets your encryption keys he's not likely to kill himself. [removed]Many gun deaths are due to previously law abiding citizens. The kind of people who would not own an illegal firearm. Things like accidental death and 2nd degree murder (no premeditation, just anger). That being said, I'm against banning guns altogether. Waiting periods and background checks do save lives. Also, buying a gun on the black market is not as easy as the NRA would have you believe. It's also much harder for a 5 year old to understand encryption than it is to shoot somebodyWhich is a huge difference, so its not really the same argument at all when any sort of context is included.But that's the point: the authorities want to track the good people. They have other methods for tracking bad people -- they always have, back when encryption meant secret book codes and dead-drops. It's called espionage, and governments are very good at it."
"But they want to control the masses, and the best way to do that is make sure they (the masses) know that the government knows (or will find out) all their dirty little secrets.ITT: a gun control debate in /r/technologyMy thoughts exactly: when encryption is outlawed only the outlaws will have encryption!Why are we still buying into this terrorism argument? It's just a stupid talking point. This is about the average person and collecting their money. Government is strangling us with taxes and crippling the world economy to save their asses.  THIS IS ABOUT YOUR DATA AND HOW THAT DATA CAN BE USED TO CONTROL YOU AND YOUR MONEY. FYI public officials: If you're not smart enough to understand why weakening encryption is a very bad thing, you shouldn't be making decisions for the public interest. Think of Apple what you will, but come privacy these guys are on top compared to other major tech companies. The ol' gun control argument.Surprise! It was never about the bad people.This is pretty similar to part of the pro gun argument actually.The idea that stopping encryption helps catch criminals is ridiculous, any serious criminals will buy encryption packages if necessary.  "
"The war on data is like the war on drugs. Currently a massive waste of time and money.Apple CEO: I'll say whatever it takes to sell more product. I'm an Apple fan, btw.That's no doubt the whole point. "
"Spying on the average citizen is no doubt far more important to these agencies who want to weaken it than spying on the tiny amount of terrorists and the like out there. "
"The likelihood of anyone in an industrialized nation being a victim of terrorism violence is so low that it barely exists. "
"In the USA, in the past several years combined the amount of people dead from terrorist violence just barely ekes into double digits, as in somewhere between 10 and 20 depending on how you count and what you include as terrorism. Basically none of it was Muslim terrorism, which seems to be the bogey man du jour."
"Meanwhile, tens of thousands have died in traffic, 8500 people have been murdered with guns in non-terrorism involved ways, and millions have perished from preventable illnesses and the like. Terrorism barely registers on the chart."
"For that, people should give up their civil liberties and right to privacy?"
"Seriously?Ah, Apple CEO, you are so adorable."
"It's not to go after whatever excuse they can come up with. It's to acquire and maintain power by doing things like illegally monitor those communications through the ministries that have no supervision (i.e. defense industries) for the interests of those who govern so that they can keep on governing. It is so naively egocentric that they would seriously jeopardize the security of their telecommunication services because of it."
"The law is not for everyone. I though that myth had been debunked some time ago. It is a high ceiling that gives a house advantage to the established few and maintains order between equals.Were going to ban use of the letter 'e' while were at it.People that are always watching you can't be trusted. They're not doing anything useful and present only risk. Increased risk increases anxiety, unease. Increasing anxiety and increasing population density can yield only one outcome.Look fellow gun owners--another double standard!Computers weren't designed to kill people though....Same exact logic applies to gun control. NRA has being saying that for years. So if we ban guns the good people will be the only ones that are affected? hmmm...EXACTLY the same reason DRM is bad.I am all in favor of pervasive encryption but this is a silly argument.  Most crimes are poorly planned if they are planned at all, and there is a good chance the the cops will find something on the suspects phone which will aid the investigation / prosecution.  We're not talking about terrorist masterminds, we're talking about some guy who texts his buddies about how he's going to kill his ex's dog, and then goes and does it.u can't hack me, I got Norton!!http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nKf2KtXnhB8/Uqfif1t8tBI/AAAAAAAABBs/nyIWLXCBXCA/s1600/hackers-gif-preparing-to-hack.gifApple is talking to the people, not the NSA and the rest of the government.  The government already knows this because the specific reason they want this is to spy on Americans, not terrorists.Welcome to the gun argument. "
"If you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns. Sounds exactly like the argument for guns. Just as valid too.Funny. This argument being used for phones and surveillance when it is a strong argument against overarching gun control laws and often dismissed.I wish this logic would be applied to gun control. Is he talking about encryption? Or gun control?It's the same thing with gun control^^this, but unfortunately I believe the stereotype demographic that would own a Mac would probably disagree with you. Not all of those, mind you, just the stereotype. I'm glad you see my point. Yea the typical stereotype wouldn't agree that's for sure. It's an interesting concept I like to think about. It's the difference between a good idea in theory and a good idea in practice. In theory, you have a problem. Either gun violence or criminals/terrorists being able to encrypt communications. How can we solve this? Oh by putting backdoors into encryption or by saying concealed carry for lawful citizens isn't allowed and all high capacity rifles should be limited to 10 rounds and have a fixed magazine. In practice this is horrible. A terrorist or criminal will find the encryption without a backdoor. Same thing for someone wanting to kill a bunch of people with a gun. So you say they can only have ten rounds and the magazine needs to be fixed? They can still quickly kill ten people. Not to mention the fact that guns and gun hardware is available anywhere. Someone looking to kill many people isn't exactly going to follow gun laws. They will just order that pmag 30 online. "
"It's ridiculous that people think outlawing or disallowing certain things that are readily available will prevent people that have already chosen to break the law from getting those things. Especially gun control. There are millions of gun owners in this country. Even more guns. By suddenly trying to control them out outlawing therm you are only putting law abiding citizens in danger. So lawful people will listen. But that guy mugging people doesn't give a shit. They will likely be even more capable to get a gun because where are all the guns people owned that are now illegal?This same argument can be applied to gun control.So kinda like gun laws? If you outlaw guns for the good law abiding citizen then only then bad unlawful people will have guns.This is a great analogy."
"Encryption : protection of data :: guns : protection from terrible people.This is essentially the same argument many make on gun control..."
"Gun laws only affect law abiding citizens because the bad guys are already cool with breaking the law.correct"
"the differences are many, however."
"everyone uses encryption in their daily lives, whether or not they know it. they only reason a guy sitting in grand central/times square with a wifi sniffer can't collect millions of credit card number is because of encrypted network connections. weakening the encryption used on these networks would be a serious attack vector that would make everyone vulnerable to these attackers."
"additionally, there is a significant gap between the average gun criminal vs the average cyber criminal. anyone using encryption in a nefarious manner is smart enough to simply not use government-broken encryption. so the ban is essentially worthless."
"people who acquire guns for nefarious purposes do not need any exceptional skill or knowledge to do harm with them, but acquiring an illegal firearm is an actual challenge that may dissuade the average dumb criminal. Except the facts simply don't support that statement. The vast majority of crime guns come from straw purchases/illegal transfers and theft. The laws on the books prohibiting straw purchasing and thefts haven't done a thing to stop these illegal gun transfers. I struggle to see how adding more words to a piece of paper will do anything to dissuade criminals...i agree with the overall argument that gun control is worthless and mostly ineffective"
"however i wouldn't agree that banning encryption is in the same league with strict gun control. i would venture to bet that at least one gun crime has been avoided simply by virtue of guns not being readily available by a would-be criminal. however, exactly zero criminals who use encryption would be stopped by a ban on encryption. a gun is physical equipment while encryption is something that can be searched for and downloaded within seconds.So wait, conservatives use this argument for gun rights and get ridiculed by liberals for being naive, but liberals can use it use it for internet privacy rights and its justified?Kinda like gunsThis could be a quote against gun control"
"The same logic applies to owning firearms, drugs, our rights, etc...I think this a conservative gun control argument applied to a different technology. If you outlaw guns, only law abiding citizens will stop buying them. ITT: every controversial comment is about gun control Just like guns. They know this, and going after the bad guys is not their true agenda. These same people don't understand this argument for more restrictive gun laws...Same can be said for strict gun control. Making it harder for a law-abiding citizen to purchase a gun does nothing to stop criminals.It definitely does.Well, just about every single other country in the world handily disproves that notion. Well, I might not quite agree, but I'm afraid to open up that whole can of worms."
"> Making it harder for a law-abiding citizen to purchase a gun does nothing to stop criminals."
"Have the lax gun laws made it easier to stop criminals?It allows more citizens to defend themselves; yes.Yes, which is why we need more conceal carriers.This same argument applies to gun control. It has been, is, and always will be about those in control retaining their control. There is a reason why there is a trope about hackers being the ones to free society from the bonds of government. This is strangely like that argument about banning guns to stop criminals.Funny, I use this argument to argue against gun control and get told that's totes not the same thing.Says the CEO of the company that ships a known-compromised version of OoenSSH in its latest OS and hasn't updated it.If you're talking about the SSH default keys, iOS doesn't ship with a vulnerability. Rooted iOS devices have it. Very logical. Sounds a bit familiar though, oh yeah, it's the same reason to not get stupid with gun control. Let's all clap and applaud Tim Cook for supporting public interests in privacy and then be totally surprised and outraged when it is eventually found out that Apple has been sharing our personal information with the NSASame thing with gun control and drugs.This is the exact same argument against more gun control."
"More gun control means you hurt the people who are law-abiding as the bad people already break existing laws and obtain their guns illegally. Except that you can't shoot somebody in the face with encryption.yeah but your kid can't accidentally encrypt himself in the head with the key you forgot to lock in a vault.funny - same could be said for gun controlWe have seen this exact law making philosophy when it comes to gun laws.  They don't care that they are only hurting the good people, that's the entire point of the legislation...His name is Tim Cook. Just like gun control!Isn't this the same reasoning people use to defend gun rights?  It seems to me you could replace 'encryption' with 'gun rights' and it would read the same.  I don't think this says anything about either issue, but I think it does say something about this argument, like, maybe it isn't all that sound.NRA or Apple. Sounds like the same argument.Yet whenever we apply this same logic to guns, reddit freaks out.Amusingly this is PRECISELY the same argument that Pro-2A folks use in regards to firearms!That's funny, this argument sounds similar to the one against gun control. Same argument regarding gun control. The other people know where to go: away from proprietary systems and companies which can be strongarmed by fascist governments like UK."
"Only open source community projects are immune. Immune? When possession or use of strong encryption can very easily be made a felony? You need to get out from the Open Source Will Save Us! lie. Stop being a fucking fanboy for two goddamn minutes. > When possession or use of strong encryption can very easily be made a felony?"
"Is it a felony to obtain and compile source, and install a firmware image? There is no such law yet. Even if it was: how do you even prove you're in violation? It's kinda hard."
"> Open Source Will Save Us! lie"
"It's not a lie. It's the only method that allows you to verify that a device is doing what it purports to be doing. Everything else is based on trusting other people, with no ability to replicate their work."

"You seem to have progressed to the bullet box already. Can't fault you with that, shoot the damn bastards while you still can.[deleted]Apple CEO needs to call it out for what it is and not pander to the dialogue. This is not about stopping bad people this is about circumventing well established Constitutional expectations. Apple CEO just needs to come out and say the governments excuse is bullshit and disingenuous.Holy shit, this is so fucking true.  More people need to understand this, instead of the neckjerk if you aren't doing anything bad, what does it matter? response.  The bad guys have darknet and deepweb connections where they can hide anyway.if anyone ever gives you the what do i have to hide? argument, just respond with this:"
"> Over the last 16 months, as I've debated this issue around the world, every single time somebody has said to me, I don't really worry about invasions of privacy because I don't have anything to hide. I always say the same thing to them. I get out a pen, I write down my email address. I say, Here's my email address. What I want you to do when you get home is email me the passwords to all of your email accounts, not just the nice, respectable work one in your name, but all of them, because I want to be able to just troll through what it is you're doing online, read what I want to read and publish whatever I find interesting. After all, if you're not a bad person, if you're doing nothing wrong, you should have nothing to hide. Not a single person has taken me up on that offer."
"Glenn Greenwald in Why privacy matters - TED TalkThis is true and the quote is great but I have to wonder what goes on behind the scenes.It's the same thing with DRM. It's only paying customers that ever have to deal with it because pirates just remove it.This whole argument they're presenting is basically saying we want to be able to raid houses of dangerous criminals easier, so we should ban door locks."
"It's so dumb and easy to see through that I really think anyone that actually buys it should be banned from ever voting again.What?  If you stop making it harder to do things, the good people will lose out as the bad ones already taught themselves to do the slightly harder things.  "
"...what?Ehh its all useless when the IT Vendors all allow backdoors for the NSA anyway.I love the fact that Apple is so strong on its stance when it comes to this matter. I really hope whatever comes next doesn't shake them from current their business policies. Working in the IT field for over 10 yrs. I can attest to that statement. I like the way he's ELI5-ing this one. "
"Bad things, good people. etc."
"This is the sort of thing we need, because governments will try to spin us out of our freedoms *democratically* by getting the ignorant to vote for bullshit.I love how everyone in here is so supportive of this statement but wont even look at the same argument for firearms.  In addition to that, banning encryption violates our right to free speech.I may be stupid to ask this but whats the long term plan. Whats their plan with motive with all this data what do you think they will do with the information?Not true at all. Many criminals use extremely unsophisticated methods to commit crimes...Oh yes, I'm sure the government wants to weaken encryption because it will help the good people in the long run. They're just misinformed, that's all! Give them the right information and you can bet they'll do the right thing! Honestly, I think that they can read encrypted data. Yeah, well, duh."
"If you remove your front door, it's not the burglars you hurt, but the people who live there."
"DEEP.Guys."
"Why is this a controversy?"
"Encrypted data is a fact of life. Federal and State laws will have to change to accommodate some hypothetical no more encryption political movement, one example being HIPPA. We effectively wouldn't be allowed to have electronic versions of patient data, which means no online/automated health-care services or health-care related services PERIOD."
"Also, encryption is merely a mathematical masking of data. Like, how can you be against that without being against things like compression algorithms. And who among us wants to outlaw 7zip?"
"To the informed, this issue is just non-sensical. Just a small point: the concept of digital backdoors has been around since way, waaay before Snowden..Thank you for that seriously obvious statementMight as well require all mail to be written on post cards as well. Federally implemented back doors are the same as someone telling you to leave your bedroom window unlocked. Stating, it's ok, we're the only ones who know about it.Honestly I have no problem for the government to spy on my internet/email/phone calls as long as they stop putting shit in my food and water and the air I breath....I find, that somehow, people who agree with this argument, tend to discount the analogous one for guns.Yes, so now allow there to be a GPGTools for iOS.This argument sounds familiar. Reminds me of the situation with immigration laws in the U.SWhy do we have to dumb down the argument to this level? Aren't the government helped by brilliant enough advisors?Encryption is a tool that ups an arms war of encryption/decryption. It can be used for good and bad. Not sure how having an unbreakable lock is somehow more good than bad or more bad than good at all.There are already end-to-end encryption services available for text messaging and VOIP. So how do they expect to halt or weaken these services? In those cases the only people who can decrypt the signals are the sender and the recipient.It's OK Apple, I've stepped my security up, Decoder Ring! Makes a bunch of sense doesn't it?"
"What benefit would the government get if they implemented wide spread monitoring? "
"They wouldn't catch the bad guys, they know how to get around."
"But direct advertising is pretty good reason eh? They know what you want so they give you ads for that stuff.this feels oddly similar to many things that are said in the debate on gun violence (not that i am for the people who want to put guns in every classroom or anything like that)I can't believe people are even *considering* outlawing encryption. I know lawmakers are dumb, but I didn't know they were *that* dumb...Silicon Valley should form its own country, or buy California and [secede from the union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secession_in_the_United_States). The tax benefits alone would be worth it. Slowly it could buy up other cash-strapped states, offering free education programs that fin in with an overall corporate agenda - giving rise to a new generation of scientists, leaders, and designers. As the old American Union slowly fades into obscurity, world peace will start to have a real chance.I see the echo chamber is still functioning.Typical politicians... If we make a law against something people will stop using it"
"We should outlaw cocaine. Oh wait....i.e. You have nothing to fear if you have nothing to hide.Unfortunately people don't feel that same way about guns yea, thats the point, retard - FBIIt's less about terrorism and more about affairs and strange porn. Im david cameron and I want to ban copy/paste in favour of sticking my penis is a pigs mouth please? See also: LawsSo Apple makes the 2nd Amendment / NRA argument and everyone is with them?Its true the FBI knows it too. The deep web is quite the place As someone going into network administration, I fear what this will cause if anything is passed to weaken encryption. So in other words the exact people who are being targeted....."
"Working as intended.I know he's not Steve Jobs, but I'm sure we'll all know who you are talking about if you say Tim Cook, lol.Quoting my network prof back in college:"
">For every lock, there is always a keyJesus Christ... Man in the middle attacks take zero effort if nothing is hidden!For once it isn't US politicians doing something stupid. Although I'm sure they're thinking the same thing. Been saying this about crackers DRM and piracy for years, exact same thing only people you hurt with draconian methods is the clean folks, anyone doing anything shady is generally going to be skilled enough that they can bypass your measuresEat shit GCHQ - I'm in Canada now!The thing is, there's no actual way to tell what he thinks."
"This is just the most profitable thing to say right now. He might mean it, or he might be saying it because he thinks it'll be a popular thing to say.Hate on Apple all you want, at least they're taking this stand.Which is of no concern to the people who want this. In fact, its almost certainly the entire motivation behind it.I've been saying for years that encryption, network security suites and certain types of hacking scripts should have 2nd Amendment protections. just be like FINE, NO MORE COMPUTERS THEN"
"After reading the article for the first time I am considering using Apple devices. So impressed.Wait, is this about actual computers, or a subtle metaphor from anti-gun control enthusiasts?He is absolutely right.Politicians don't care. They are paid but care. After all they are taught that they know better than everybody else.Wow - Tim Cook being smart.  Weird.First sense out of his mouthWow finally something useful from Apple. I didn't read every comment, but the overwhelming majority of the people in this thread have no fucking clue how this works."
"Data being secure and that secure data being untraceable by the government are sooooo different.What's the point behind weakening encryption? To make it easier to crack the encryption? A fucking no brainer. Might as well not encrypt at all. Could well make it to a modern-day Monty Python skit.Is it just me or does there seem to be a lot of similar rhetorical motifs between gun control and encryption policy?This logic could applied elsewhere also. Like on gun control.Only good guys with encryption can stop bad guys with encryption.This is my argument against gun controlSounds like the NRA but what do I know.If you make your devices closed source, the people you hurt are not the folks that want to do bad things. It's the good people. The other people know where to go.The exact same logic applies to citizen disarmament.This is why Tim Cook rocks. It's the same dumb government logic as gun control. Cook is a proud NRA member btw. Gates is a OBAMA loving hippy. Source? I don't know what Cook's specific stance on gun control is, but regardless of that I doubt you could really call him a conservative.You don't have to be a conservative to have a logical/non-fear based stance on firearms.No, but the rest of your comment seems like it is trying to portray him as more conservative than he is."
"I would still be interested in a source on him being a proud NRA member. I haven't been able to find anything googling around for it.Is this satire or can you come up with a source for Tim Cook being a member of the NRA?He assumes that the government isn't one of the 'other people'.No he's not. He's just being careful how he's framing the whole thing. He's not stupid. Perhaps. Maybe this would be better:"
"His statement implies or suggests that the government isn't one of the 'other people'.It sounds like he was telling a room full of 5-year-olds.All criminals are technologically sophisticated and all noncriminals are not."
"Simply not true.I remember years ago when I, as well as many others, looked at Apple as the epitome of evil corporation. Now that's quite far from the truth. I really respect most of what they've done in the past few years and the way they shaped their corporate culture is huge.If banning encryption will help keep bad people from doing bad things, shouldn't banning guns do it as well? Hell, why not just throw everyone in prison, because they just 'might' do something illegal at some point in their life.Hahahaha. Apple CEO doesn't have a name. Where is Google on this issue?Thanks for not circlejerking about apple.isn't that what they say about guns? In Australia, after a minor incident all guns are taken by the government and VERY few gun misuse and accidents are found. though I can't attest to the violence (sexual assault, battery, ...) being reduced."
"Though the transport of guns can be easily caught as Australia is a continent far far away separated by vast ocean. In America, it might be downright impossible. Where are guns manufactured and assembled anyway?I can build a gun in my garage in a weekend. 3D printing is a bitch"
"Strange. This is the same argument used by 2nd amendment rightists.Don't Apple and Google already have backdoors in their phones?Same argument for gun control. Apple only is interested in protecting rich people.  Can't have people of more-than-modest means being inconvenienced by being hacked."
"Exhibit A: The Fappening.  "
"Exhibit B: Their release of a crypto library that doesn't work.Wait, wait, wait, did someone from Apple say something totally correct?"
"To everyone that doesn't know how often you use encryption, everytime you see a https:// instead of http:// you're using encryption. You need strong encryption, because the bad people might want your info and with poor encryption and backdoors they are likely to get it, and then it doesn't help you at all that the government have the same info as the bad people."
"Also there are already really strong encryptions out there that the bad people probably already use, so a weak encryption only really hurts you.Great argument. Same argument for guns and bitcoin... and... everything."
"Same concept for gun ownership.This is the same argument against gun control. Imagine if the same logic was applied to gun ownership.Or RPG ownership, or tank ownership, or artillery ownership, or ICBM ownership...Private citizens actually do own those things... Although I'm not sure where one would buy an ICBM but the others aren't difficult to come by legally.You are being sarcastic but I don't think you realize almost no weapon is banned in the US. Just heavily heavily restricted when you get past weapons the typical man could carry.Outlaw both PGP and RPG!!!!! /sSo by your logic, you, a regular citizen, only need 8 bit encryption. Only the government should have the best encryption, because they are the only ones that can be trusted with it.I'm glad you now see how ridiculous it is to try and compare weapon ownership to privacy rights.  I wouldn't say it's ridiculous at all. The government has no business in what weapons I own, or what encryption I use.Privacy and guns are totally different.They are not mutually exclusive.  The 2nd protects the other rights.  The bill of rights is an enumeration of basic human rights, it's not a ranking of importance.What makes them different?Privacy is the the ability to think or perform acts in a setting or situation where information about these thoughts or events are inaccessible to others. "
"A gun is a device designed to hold,  and trigger,  a chemically,  electrically,  air,  or otherwise propelled projectile, at a remote target. "
"I already understand the technical differences, although I appreciate your response. I should have been more clear with my question. When it comes to government control of citizen activity, what makes gun ownership or use of encryption different? Why can this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/3sa38d/apple_ceo_if_you_halt_or_weaken_encryption_the/cwvdz94) get up voted, but some one applying the same reason get down voted?And yet both are considered basic human rights in the United States.I bet he hates gunsHe's from Alabama, so that's a big bet...Translation: I am saying this because it makes my company look great and the competition look like assholes. They can profit from your information and we don't. We profit using huge markups so we'll tell you that your privacy matters... unless we ever decide to make money off of your information. Then, we'll pull the fastest 180 in the history of anything. Oh, the government already has ways to get your info. We couldn't do business in the US if we actually blocked them.Says the company that uses slave labor, bloody minerals, and dodges all taxes."
"They are bad people, they just like to pretend otherwise.Dumb dumb here. What's encryption? "
"Edit: I'll Google it, but if anyone wants to tell me anyways I'll be forever grateful."
"Edit 2: Googled it and still lost. :/Encryption is used to secure information, often when sent to someone. If you want so send hello to someone and encrypt it, an algorithm will transform it so something like iwjqkiwnamk so that no one can see the content of your message during delivery. Only the recipient will have the counterpart to your encryption (like a key) to see what you originally sended. It's an important part of data security today and necessary to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks (systems that sniff in networks to get passwords out of the sent data)"
"If the government would force devices to have a backdoor, like a master key for the government to decrypt the data, they would be adding a severe security hole to the device, helping attackers to get your data. It's dangerous and stupid to go against encryption, since it's already hard to prevent hackers from trying to breach into your servers as a company.Its funny how this argument is invalid when it comes go drugs or guns. yeah, the government already knows where to go if they want to fuck over apple users"
"the engineers/programmers you hired, tim cookI know this is pithy and it's going to be front page material regardless of the facts but it's not actually true. I work in law enforcement and your average criminal isn't moriarty or even the villain in a typical law and order episode. I quite regularly find troves of incriminating evidence that they are carrying around for no reason at all. I once had a girl with a netbook who had an excel spreadsheet accounting for her cocaine sales saved to the front page without securing windows with any kind of password. Encryption saves these felons from their own stupidity. "
"In other words: *If I look hard enough, I can find something to charge anyone with, please let me look at all their stuff so I can charge everyone*No in other words if criminals were already encrypting their info then law enforcement wouldn't care since the evidence was already beyond reach. Reddit has this misperception that if it's common knowledge within the hive mind then it is common knowledge within society at large. It just isn't true. Most criminals talk to cops even after their Miranda warning. People give permission for searches all the time. Even when they are hiding contraband. "
"If the average criminal was smart enough to take sensible precautions he wouldn't be a criminal. The average criminal isn't encrypting, so banning encryption is a good idea......"
"Just because some people give up their rights willingly, doesn't mean you get to take them away from everyone.That's not what I said. There are very valid privacy concerns especially with so much data being stolen by online criminals. But this statement linked by the op is incorrect. > statement linked by the op is incorrect."
"The statement isn't about innocent people being arrested, it's about hurt. There are many ways that breaking encryption comes back to hurt the very people government is said to represent. From economic impacts, to social, and onwards."
"Who cares about criminals stealing data when the government is stealing so much more data as to make criminal efforts appear comicalCould you provide a link for more info on that case? It sounds like you're exemplifying small scale incidents to support a decision of societal scale. Who wants to talk? ;)"

"-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----Well that was annoying. The problem is of course authenticity :)The circlejerk is strong here on Reddit. How about a more nuanced, realistic take: Encryption has both good and bad consequences, as does government surveillance."
"I'll take my downvotes right here, tyvm.Since when did Apple Care about common folk?[deleted]> Until Apple goes open source they cannot be trusted no matter what they say."
"You'll be down voted to hell, but your right.Their programming language Swift is open source, among what others have said."
"Anyway, they'll probably open source OS X and iOS as soon as Microsoft open sources Windows and Windows Phone OS. Which is to say never.Based on your comments here the best thing I can suggest for you is to not use any technology. I don't know what you do on your computer that makes you so paranoidYour downvotes confirm it. Apple. You will die a slow and beautiful death. You used to be good. And then you turned that gold into shit. That is some accomplishment. You can't seriously be suggesting that the largest computer company open source everything. That makes no business sense at all. No company would do that. Companies open source things that they don't mind competitors having.opensource.apple.comTheir OS kernels have been open-sourced from the get-go, and they recently open sourced their crypto library."
"https://developer.apple.com/cryptography/That's right. Hate on one of the few companies that's publicly opposing this fucking insanity. That will make things turn out right! Step 1: Be Apple CEO  "
"Step 2: Say Something obvious  "
"Step 3:???  "
"Step 4: random person gets karma.  It's hard to believe Tim Cook could be so naive. Attempts to weaken encryption are part of a strategy for eventual political profiling so that this society of the rich can identify and detain people who oppose their agenda.Yes, created by the illuminati. Maybe, just maybe, his message was to the public, not to the people who know this. You can be sure that anybody who uses the word folks in a public forum is a sociopath.Built in back doors at hardware level in processors? if an apple ceo said you put 1 and 1 together and you get 2, someone would be highlighting this quote as a notable observation from the apple ceo.Apple not being evil? What? "
"Serious propsSame thing with the second amendment right to keep and bear arms."
"I am surprised that it took liberals this long to figure it out finally. Actually, it's funny you say that.  There's a rare but horrible virus that I've run across while fixing people's computers."
"Basically, it infects through an innocuous file and encrypts every single data file in your OS in 2048 bit asynchronous encryption.  Then, it says that it will delete the encryption key if you don't pay them $500 or $1000 in bitcoins within 6-12 months of infection.  It provides instructions on how to purchase bitcoins, how to pay them, and how to use TOR in case their site is blocked."
"So amusingly, his statement is not completely true.  Encryption is already absurdly strong as-is.  Honestly, there's not much you can do to actively weaken it.  2048 asynchronous can encrypt 1 GB/s under virtually unbreakable encryption.  Is there even a point in entertaining the notion that it could be weakened or broken in some way without the public key?  Brute forcing the key would take millions of years lol.  At that point, the only weakness of encryption is the human element.Except even if us non bad actors don't have that level of encryption, the bad guys will still find it because *somebody somewhere* will ignore the laws and create stronger encryption. So your entire scenario doesn't even play out any differently.I fail to believe he really gives a shit given that Apple work for the intelligence servicesPlease, please don't downvote me because I do believe privacy is very important and shouldn't be compromised. But I cannot be a hypocrite and accept this reasoning because it's the exact same logic that gun nuts use to argue for looser gun laws. Banning guns hurts the good guys because the bad guys will still know where to go to get them anyways.the differences in these arguments are many"
"not everyone uses a gun in their daily lives. in fact, 99% of people do not. however, everyone uses encryption in their daily lives, whether or not they know it. they only reason a guy sitting in grand central/times square with a wifi sniffer can't collect millions of credit card number is because of encrypted network connections. weakening the encryption used on these networks would be a serious attack vector that would make everyone vulnerable to these attackers."
"additionally, there is a significant skill gap between the average gun criminal vs the average cyber criminal. anyone using encryption in a nefarious manner is smart enough to simply not use government-broken encryption. so the ban is essentially worthless."
"people who acquire guns for nefarious purposes do not need any exceptional skill or knowledge to do harm with them, but acquiring an illegal firearm is an actual challenge that may dissuade the average dumb criminal.Well you can argue that banning guns still makes it harder for gun nuts to obtain guns. And for guns, it's not just 'bad guys' who are the problem. A lot of accidents are caused by innocents owning guns, police carrying guns, kids taking guns to school, mentally ill people; these people are not in the category of 'terrorists', they are not necessarily the people would still know where to get a gun."
"The same is not true for privacy. Encryption is extremely easy, banning it makes no ounce of difference to the difficulty of encrypting messages for those 'bad guys'. > But I cannot be a hypocrite and accept this reasoning because it's the exact same logic that gun nuts use"
"So you don't agree with it because it sounds similar to an argument about another completely unrelated topic? That's some terrible logicIt's really not, if an argument isn't valid, it isn't valid. Context is irrelevant in socratic method.What an incredible generalisation So what reasoning do you use to stop the government from abusing its power?That's kinda the point.  When everyone uses PGP, it's really hard to sift through all that info and find the bad guys.  If only criminals use PGP, then you just find PGP users and you know you're going to find something in their ranks quickly and efficiently.If Encryption is removed from the face of the earth then what happens to those emails sent from the US to China that negotiate a way to crush the Russian economy forcing them to beg the US for help?  "
"That email is now free for anyone and everyone to read.  "
"How about those communications which could be so secret hidden from the public for years and years which has now been stolen by some 14 year old hacktivist proving that Bush ordered Bin Laden to blow up the towers then thought shit we need someone to blame and cover my ass... Saddam/Osama did it!.  "
"I hope the government understands that if they remove encryption all their stuff could effectively be laid bare to the public and any other nation intent on digging up some secrets to force politicians  in to bend over backwards to help avoid tax etc...  "
"Ask yourselves this? Are you fully prepaid to disclose every last moment of your life online? Are you willing to show that saucy text you just sent your wife to the public?  "
"Well thanks for the downvote. Maybe explain why?Theres already backdoors in Apple products just for the NSA. "
"Call it *conspiracy* until the next Ed Snow if you want.  Prove it? You're saying the NSA can break AES? No there aren't. And how exactly would you know?They aren't *direct* backdoors made specifically or in conjunction with the NSA. But just like MS, they often leave known vulnerabilities in their software, and share that information so that they can put their hands up in the air should something come back around. This is what we call the 3 way hand shake. it's funny that is's the apple CEO who's saying this."
"since apple product are known for their good security.If that's sarcasm, they actually are pretty good with security.Its crazy how people think encryption protects them, the NSA controls so many nodes they can middleman any password they want no problemo.How?? What good people need encryption the government cant access when the person is under arrest... ya know, for nothing. I dont need to encrypt my bank info, or my WoW login info, or my credit card statements, or my SIN number, or like whatever the hell else people think they need to encrypt. "
"Can anyone give me some examples of non-tinfoil-hat things people legitimately  need to encrypt that arent incriminating? medical records, banking information, sensitive business documents, legal correspondence, personal familly issues, Tax info, basically anything you wouldn't want to paste to your front window for everyone to see"
"think of anything you would mail that you wouldn't want to just write on the back of a postcard (which anyone can read and roughly equates to an unencrypted message).Naw, thats hardly comparable. "
"A) There is no post man delivering my emails by hand and for some reason curious of my personal business. "
"B) Why do you have your medical records / digital medical records?"
"C) Why do you have your banking information on a computer? "
"D) Sensitive Business documents almost works, except any company with business documents worth looking at have an internal network and business infrastructure. Not personal use. "
"E) Your criminal record is accessible by anyone who wants to know. And its not like they email you your charges... so this isnt even a real thing."
"F) Personal family issues falls under the mailman thing. "
"G) Assuming you do your own taxes and would have that on your computer, uh who would give a shit? What are they gonna do with that info? Not to mention the flawed logic there. If someone is taking an interest in you enough to hack your computer/phone then they already know you make money. They arent going to hack you and be like oh man, tax info! This looks interresting!!. "
"People mail almost everything you listed above *every day*. Legal documents, tax info, bank information, business documents, and *especially family issues*. Medical Records are probably the only thing shared digitally, and even then you get your health card in the mail. "
"The only thing anyone encrypts are nude pics, and assuming you have them legally then there are much better ways to hide them. Look man I gave you a good answer I don't have to make you accept itThats true, but my reply wasnt so much for you as for anyone who reads it. But thanks for the answer, even if I disagree. privacy isn't about what you have **to hide** it's about deciding what you want **to share**Wording something to sound dramatic doesn't change the reality of the topic. The average person doesn't encrypt shit and they're fine. The only thing strong encryption protects are criminals. "
"Also, you're computer is fine. You a aren't important enough to worry about it. If it da real concern people wouldn't have had to brute force celebrities iTunes passwords to leak their nudes. "
"Gotta be realistic about this. He also said  The PC is dead. You shouldn't necessarily listen to this guy. "
"Not that I'm for weakening encryption...Well, yes, that's marketing. He's not going to say Windows is doing amazing! as CEO of Apple.It's such a shame Tim Cook of all people has to say this. Apple is pure evil, I don't want them making sense.leave and never return please."
"how is he evil?It's Apple. They're the closest thing to a real-life SPECTRE. Why do you even ask?Just because Apple products are generally sold at quite a high price and are very closed doesn't mean that they're evil.That is *exactly* what makes them evil.Evil, or just unappealing to you? Because I don't see any problem with selling those items unless they have a monopoly, which they obviously don't.wow nerdittors praising Apple.. next step: cops for doing their jobOh please, Tim Cook is just pandering like politician.  something something something ANDROID IS LUITERALLY HEAVEN AND APPLLE IS OUT TO RAPE YOU.The government needs to make strong encryption illegal. There really is no need to have strong encryption unless you have something to hide, i.e. criminal/terrorist intent. Also, by forcing weak encryption, this allows intelligence/law enforcement agencies the ability to more easily discern between legal and illegal activities. Terrorists/criminals will continue to use strong encryption and this will make them more easy to track.Weak encryption doesn't just let the good guys in; it lets the bad guys in as well. That's the problem. If you pass laws that say nobody's allowed to lock their doors so police have easier access, criminals have easier access as well.That is a small price to pay to prevent another 9/11 or something even worse. Also, the government having more access to data will make it easier, not harder, to capture the criminals you are talking about. Weakening encryption can only be a net positive overall so it is a good trade off.Weakening encryption can only be a net positive"
"So you're okay with anyone being able to read your credit card number when you make a transaction?  I don't understand. There are many types of information that I'd like to keep secure."
"I do have something to hide: my money from criminals accessing my online banking. And if that happens, you can easily get your money back, but if another 9/11 happens or worse because terrorists can easily communicate over any network, then those lives lost can't come back. Also, government having more access to data will make it easier to capture criminals stealing your information, not harder.I hate Apple, but just this once...amen.Coming from Apple, this is hilarious. What? Apple seems to be the only one standing up against the government for encryption. While other tech companies (i.e. Google and Microsoft) are being very quiet about it. apple wants end to end so they can control you like they do all there users"
"Well by that reasoning I guess my bank controls me because I use https...>Apple CEO: If you halt or weaken encryption, the people that you hurt are not the folks that want to do bad things. It's the good people. The other people know where to go."
"What about the good people, for some reason or another, are about to do bad things?"
"They make up the majority."
"People are not born hardened seasoned criminals, they are made."
"The governments reasons for snooping is to stack the deck in their favor, to catch the newly Breaking Bad types before they reign a lot of destruction."
"I don't mind the government snooping because the government works on the rule of law. What I don't like is when corporate leaders feel they also can do the same thing, profit by it and in the meanwhile blow a lot of hot air about how they are defending their users when in reality they are not."
"Like Tim Cook is really going to throw in for all the users and allow potential terrorists a means to communicate without their encryption being broken. Yea, right. "
"And since one cannot tell the good from the bad guys, or when the good guys turn bad, then everyone gets snooped on regardless."
"I would be just glad if Tim Cook would stop all the Apple spying and tracking that Apple is doing themselves without the governments intervention, it's not like they need the money."
"Innocent until proven guilty is an decidedly American tenant. Not only are you assuming people to be guilty before providing any evidence, you're already willing to knowingly violate the rights of more innocents to find this evidence. It's people like you who will bring about the police state. "
"Better hope you never disagree with the government, or piss of a rich guy.  maybe some evidence happens to find its way onto your computer. It's really that easy. We found child porn on his PC.  And you just disappear. "
"And you're *asking* for this. Why? Because of the one in a million chance you'll get shot by a drug dealer or a terrorist? Your more likely to drown in your bathtub, or die falling down the stairs. These enemies of yours are imaginary."
"I assume this means your for banning all guns? And for outlawing personal cars, soda, cigarettes and beer?>I don't mind the government snooping"
"Just think of the time when the people in power are not the ones you agree with, and how they can use and manipulate your data to make you conform. it sucks that people like you existThis guy is a frequent contributor to r/applesucks. I think we can safely say he's not looking at the situation very objectively.Probably an nsa shill :p"
"Apple CEO Tim Cook directly responds to court order requiring decryption of San Bernardino shooter's iPhone> And while the government may argue that its use would be limited to this case, there is no way to guarantee such control."
"This is the single most important point in this whole debate. There is absolutely no guarantee and furthermore, access by unauthorized parties becomes a function of time.Similar to the gun debate in that regard.A government actor could, instead of getting Apple to create a compromised version of iOS, obtain the Apple source code and signing key and do it themselves. Getting the source code would be straightforward--all they need is a spy working there. Getting the signing key might be a bit harder, but with the resources of the U.S. government, it sure seems possible."
"Same goes for any company that has source code. It's not *that* difficult to obtain. Hell, the source code for Windows is out in the wild--I bet the source code for iOS is obtainable, too.I mean, there probably is (in some capacity) an internal code repository at Apple. I'd wager it's *extremely* locked down from everyone that doesn't need access, possibly encrypted in the same way that iMessages are, so only the engineers working on the project can access the code for it.They would still need to install that software on the phone which requires the phone to be decrypted prior to the installation. Apple should build a device to beat their own encryption, let the feds use it just this one time with the supervision of Apple, then after they get what they need Tim Cook will simply type in his own name, and the machine will self destruct and catch on fire The modern iPhones all use full disk encryption, where the access to the flash chip goes through a chip that is needed to decrypt the flash memory. If I am not mistaken, this is also the chip that would wipe the memory if the wrong password is entered too many times. The flash memory is AES256 encrypted with a key burned in, in the factory. In other words, not even the owner of the phone knows this particular key. That is why you can't simply move the flash memory from one device to another, and then keep using it."
"So that device you are talking about, would need to break AES256. That would not be feasible for the near future, unless they are in possesion of severely advanced quantum computers, or a lot of time. Or they could to extract the key from a most likely tamper resistent chip.It was a joke referencing The Dark Knight movie where Batman makes that machine that can eavesdrop on everyone in the city and Lucias is against it I'm confused now - if that is the case, how would creating a new iOS which removes some security features gain them access to the data, presumably you still need both keys to get to the data?"
"*edit* ok the BBC says they only want to be able to guess the passcodes without the risk of the flash being erased. And then Gotham will be saved. "
"And... I am pretty sure they are not liable if you are compromised. Plus their phones become a ***lot*** more vulnerable to a brute-force attack.Unlikely? I guarantee that the government/courts will apply this again, to the point that in 10 years, it's routinely used in things like divorce cases. Doubt me? Look at what has happened with car black boxes and cell phone gps information. It would be another stingray. It would be commonly used, clearly illegal, but used in a way that makes it unchallengeable. Scope creep...  Back doors and internet filters both..Isn't the phone the property of the county, as it was a work phone? So Apple is refusing the owners request here. The county authorized the FBI to help here.I look at this as the soccer mom debate point. They think some power of the government will only be used in a case like this, then ignore how it's abused for every run of the mill drug investigation and more. I wonder if the person making that argument actually believes that bullshit or is just a evil lying sack of shit.Kind of makes you think of the atomic bomb. Terrifying.It's also absurd since there is no evidence that any event the Federal government has expanded it's authority claiming it was for a single emergency has ever been given up and almost always used again.  I hate to be brutal here but the Fed's are liars.  Always have been.  Maybe it's not their intention to be so but they are making promises they know good and well they can't and behind closed doors would say they have no desire to keep.If there is one thing the government, particularly its intelligence agencies, have shown time and time again, it's that given the opportunity, they will abuse *any* privilege they are granted for any ends they see fit."
"I am as absolutely certain as the sun will rise each morning that if this tool is provided to them, it will be abused in a matter of hours. I can't imagine it being more than a couple of years before the tool is in the hands of everyone from the FBI down to the small town police station and it becomes a normal part of day to day policing. Arrest someone for drink and disorderly? Confiscate their phone and go fishing for something."
"This is law enforcement's wet dream and the likelihood of them behaving themselves with it is somewhere between 0 and none."
"This response is what happens when you spend decades abusing the trust of the people and then have the nerve to say trust us. Given the lack of oversight and accountability of these organisations, I think it safe to say they have no reason as to why they *should* be trusted.> access by unauthorized parties becomes a function of time"
"So does the likelihood that an FBI agent gets turned by a foreign government. "
"You'll be surprised what threatening family or giving a few million will do to a person.The FBI can't keep it's personelle records safe from"
"China, does anyone believe they could keep this secret from China? Especially now that they know said magic bullet might be made?Is it the most important?  I'd say that not only is it *not* the most important point, but it's a bad one to make the most important point.  Even if they could make a magical guarantee, they are still wrong.  "
"When we say things like but you can't guarantee... then the conversation becomes about how they can try to make said guarantee or at least be able to to convince you of said guarantee.  It shifts the goal posts and creates misinformation for the many people out there that are not too familiar with the concept of encryption.  A trustworthy government has no more right to this as an untrustworthy one. "
"Encryption is encryption and nobody, include the government, has any special right for secret ways to break it.  It undermines freedom.  It undermines security.  It undermines the entire Information Age.  It's as simple as that.  "
"This may happen but in my opinion the real problem will be that with all the hassle they'll possibly go back to making less secure phones. Then they can just unlock them next time."
"But if they do the authorities will continue to ask them to unlock every phone they seize from then on. So, Apple can't win either way. Damned if you do, damned if you don't."
"All it is essentially is the gov harassing a technology company regardless of which solution they offer.> All it is essentially is the gov harassing a technology company regardless of which solution they offer."
"And doing it publicly so as to either shame the company or gain public support. As my security professor once told us, it's not a matter of what are the chances. It's a matter of when.Not just a matter of can't guarantee, it seems *hilariously* unlikely that this won't immediately lead to the same request every time they find a device they think is interesting, and shortly after that it'll end up in the hands of third parties. I think you mean "
"Contractors"
"Then, a few years later local cops ala stingrays.You're absolutely correct.  Eventually, the technology to brute force phones would be sold to local PD's by a private company.  Hell, it will probably just be an upgrade on a [UFED] (http://www.cellebrite.com/Mobile-Forensics/Solutions/ufed-pro-series), which many local departments already have."
"Source: Retired Detective - and have used these types of devices.Yep. Cellebrite is notorious for this. To my knowledge none of them work on recent iOS or Apple hardware.Cellebrite sure makes it seem like they're a handy, helpful corporation - except their sole reason for existing is violating human rights and invading privacy."
"The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) supports Apple's position:"
"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/02/eff-support-apple-encryption-battleI like the message, but how do we verify that Apple upholds Cook's promise? "
"I know this might sound like conspiracy gobble, but for all we know, this public address could be a publicity stunt to cover up the opposite and garner trust in Apple as a defender of privacy."
"Secret courts and gag orders are thing.We can't know. But by writing this open letter, Apple is shining a light on the attacks on privacy by the US government, ones that are even more personal than the Snowden leaks.Because right now they could say they've been ordered by a court and must comply, but instead they're having their lawyers fight it in court, which costs them money and risks them getting bad PR-- you know Fox News will paint them as terrorist lovers. It's government vs. big business. Fox News might be more sympathetic than you expect.Just donated to the EFF and I urge other redditors to do the same. They've been fighting for our freedoms for a very long time.I feel like anyone sane and remotely knowledgeable supports Apple's position."
"But in seriousness, it is good to see another organization speak out in support.Wow. Major props to standing up for what you believe in, even at the behest of your own government. All I can hope for is that other tech companies will stand in solidarity with Apple.Lol, it's marketing.They can afford it. They do have more money than the government after all. A bum on the street has more money than government when you consider debt.  Remember that when they want to raise taxes.I'm sorry but I can't take you seriously when you make a comparison like that. "
"I get what you're trying to do but it's not coming across like you want it to. Indeed! Not all companies would stand up like this. The reply Apple has given makes me proud to be their customer. What if Apple is just making a stand against this publicly, but actually willingly complies anyway? He needs to be willing to step forward as the one saying no when the contempt of court talk starts.  Be willing to sit in jail for a little bit as the CEO of the world's most recognizable company to make a point.  I think this would go away.He should have linked the apple 1984 big brother ad after his name.I don't understand this though. It seems like other tech companies like Yahoo, Google, and even Apple were forced to hand over metadata etc. How is Apple, who once spied on their own customers via the iPhone suddenly standing up to the feds on this? It seems inconsistent.You act like our government  doesn't do shit all the time to fuck people over... You can certainly count out Google and the NSA."
"http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/5/6/nsa-chief-google.htmlEverytime Cook brings this up though we don't hear a peep from either MSFT or Alphabet. It'd be nice if the 3 big companies stood together.This was nearly 2 years ago (the story), and it says they had email exchanges and a relationship with the NSA _before_ the Snowden revelations. Apparently, Google was under the impression the NSA were the good guys and were helping in terms of technology. NOT in just wholesale turning over everyone's information to the NSA. "
"After Snowden and Google finds out just what the hell the NSA was doing, including hacking into their own networks, they were pissed:"
"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131106/00235225143/pissed-off-google-security-guys-issue-fu-to-nsa-announce-data-center-traffic-now-encrypted.shtml"
"Also, Google has been one of the few companies that have actually gone to court over the National Security Letters they get from the FBI. Hey, blame Google for looking at searchs for vibrators that play o cum all ye faithful all you want. But they don't want governments prying into everyone's business either. "
"And also, this:"
"http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-now-requires-full-device-encryption-on-new-android-6-0-devices/"
"Remember, Android isn't like Apple. Google didn't have total control over devices and software. Manufacturers like HTC, Samsung and Motorola can take their software and then do whatever they want to with it...including choosing not to encrypt them by default. With 6.0 though, Google is requiring it and their trying to gain more control.There's nothing there suggesting Google is any more willing to provide backdoor access to Android devices. Apparently to you just speaking to the NSA is criminal. You must have missed the bit in Tim's letter where he stated that up until this point they have been cooperating with the FBI and have provided all the data they have access to.I mean, I don't think they really have a choice in the matter to talk to the Feds if it's court mandated... Very different than willful cooperation. Are t most android phones unencrypted because it's software encryption which was too resource heavy? Therefore they wouldn't need a back foot to hack into the phone. Pretty much any Android phone can be encrypted, easily. From Android 6.0 on, the encryption is on by default. And the performance boost you get disabling it is in the range of not humanly perceptible."
"At least, that's the case on high end phones. I guess that with 80EUR toy phones, it might be a whole different story. "
"The high-end devices most likely all have hardware acceleration for the encryption used, so the performance hit will be negligible.Thats because all new phones will need to have a hardware encryption chip installed so that it no longer bogs down the software.My brain just moved Apple from the Fuck You bin to the Good Guy bin.Superficially I agree wholeheartedly with you, but in this instance that is only because Apple's interests align with ours.  On another issue this could be an example of a corporation acting against the will of the people's government in order to protect its own interests."
"I don't know what I find more scary: that a corporation can wield this much power; that it takes an entity with the power and profile of Apple to stand up to the government; or that the government's agenda is so diametrically opposed to the needs of the people it represents.Apple's power was given to it by _us_, and we could take it away in a product cycle. What's more inherently democratic than that?Product cycles are even more frequent than election cycles. I like where this is headed...The amount of money they have... It would take more than a product cycle to lose that power.A democracy. I'm not yet ready to fully transition to a corporate Republic Well if Apple felt it would lose their customers by opposing this then they wouldn't do it. Ironically we're actually seeing corporations representing our interests better than the elected government officials, because the corporation is financially motivated to do so. The government is acting in the best interests of itself and the country, not it's people.I always thought that a country was it's people...THAT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE SOMETHING A TRUE PATRIOT WOULD SAY!Oh you sweet summer child.Thank you, Tim Cook!"
"Maybe the FBI should have been more thorough at the suspect's apartment instead of leaving shredded documents, and volumes of other material behind and Letting the media storm the apartment. Were they just being lazy or something?Apple has many faults, but the thing that I admire most about the company is its stance on encryption and data security. Even the recent news on Error 53 if a third-party Touch ID Home button is used on an iPhone highlights their focus on security; controversial as bricking the device is, it definitely prevents any compromised fingerprint sensors from accessing and storing fingerprint data. I hope Apple will continue to fight the efforts of out-of-touch politicians and overreaching government agencies like the FBI to weaken encryption, which no doubt is used by the government itself to protect its own secrets. "
"Much more about iOS security in [Apple's white paper.](https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf)To be fair, encryption and security have only become larger issues for Apple within the past couple years. The article is referring to the user pin code on the phone itself, not transmitted data. Messaging to and from Apple devices can still be accessed by the government as it passes through cell networks, from what we know."
"The change in messaging, I think, has more to do with ripping support from public-sector BlackBerry contracts. BlackBerry data is encrypted locally and is not accessible by the government while traversing a network. It is the reason why BlackBerry is banned in India and China, as they have refused to allow government decryption. They are still the go-to smartphones for the public sector in every single developed country, and those are contracts that Apple wants its phones on."
"Apple is playing catch-up on the only remaining field that it doesn't have an edge over BlackBerry, and that is data security. I'm glad that it is finally being taken seriously, as I'm an iPhone user myself.I also support and applaud Apples stance, but lets not put a halo on them and call them revolutionaries fighting for our freedom."
"A very large part of this stand comes from a twofold self interest. "
"Firstly as a commercial enterprise in personal communications, it is a massive value drop to be told publicly that your data and conversations cannot be considered secure. A publicly acknowledged backdoor will mean that anyone with the right security clearance,and the right black market channels has unlimited access to any ones data, be it of commercial, personal or criminal nature. "
"Try selling that on TV and billboards with bright primary colours."
"Secondly, given the huge amount of public data dumps stolen recently, Apple are wise enough to know that by drastically weakening the publics expected security, they drastically weaken themselves. Large companies from Ashley Madison to Sony know they are primary targets in the encryption wars."
"Thankfully for us, Apples economic survival depends having access to exactly the level of security the pubic needs and deserves.It makes zero sense to brick the device when they could just disable the touch ID feature instead.  Which is exactly what they do UNTIL you update the device.   Then they brick it.  They only care about your security until you update it.   "
"Your comment makes no sense.  Their argument is if someone were to create an unofficial device which plugs into the wire where the one button connects and brute force access to a stolen phone. all they need to do is open up the phone and connect their device (pre-iOS 9.2.1) and boom they have access.  Now they can no longer do that as home buttons have an authenticity check which a 3rd party device (home button brute forcer) would fail."
"Simply disabling the Touch ID means that the system falls back on the less secure method a key code.  which could be beaten by trying 99,999 times if the user doesn't set the phone to erase itself after 10 tries and erasing itself still doesn't stop the bad guys from selling the phone."
"It is still better to brick a stolen phone than to allow the bad guys access to stored passwords which may include bank accounts or personal information.  "
"Apple should unbrick currently bricked devices allowing them to return to older versions of iOS, but still keep the bricking functionality moving forward (including blocking users with modified phones from future software upgrades)."
"It's simply too hard to create a grandfather clause for phones with unofficial home buttons because eventually bad guys find a way to use that clause to allow them to connect and use a brute force device.I've argued this point *dozens of times* in the past week so I'm going to up vote your negative post in the hopes others see this reply: "
"The TL:DR is the nature of the fingerprint sensor involves trusted access to something called the secure enclave. A modified device could pull not just your fingerprint data but the MASTER KEY derived from your passcode + UDID used to write the AES-256 scrambled data to NAND storage. "
"Basically, it could fuck you. Nobody in the security world was mad about this. It was absolutely, 100% the right call to do and awesome for Apple to even have this kind of security at all.They don't take this stance because they believe in privacy. Just like Microsoft they will stand by it as long as it's profitable."
"I'm not saying it's a bad thing, just remember that it's because of money, not principles.Apple has always been about privacy. "
"http://youtu.be/39iKLwlUqBoAnd it's the same with Google, etc. They're companies, meant to make a profit. But what you're missing is that companies need to be founded on principles in order to be an organization at all. Because if profit is their 100% sole motivator then there's plenty of other industries they could be in or things to sell. I was gong to say, all of a sudden the Touch ID debacle makes a lot more sense. Originally it was cast as apples war against 3rd party repair companies, and while that's a side effect, it was likely an action they took in response to the security concern. > controversial as bricking the device is, it definitely prevents any compromised fingerprint sensors from accessing and storing fingerprint data."
"So that's what it was? Have a source for that? Couldn't find it in your link. Because that would make infinitely more sense than them just locking out third party repairs (while they don't brick devices for third party repairs on other parts of their phones). Somehow must've missed that during the outrage back then."
"EDIT: found one myself: http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/06/apple-says-iphone-error-53-is-to-protect-customers-securityWell, that's because when it comes to Apple and Reddit, outrage outruns facts by several hundred miles an hour. >  Even the recent news on Error 53 if a third-party Touch ID Home button is used on an iPhone highlights their focus on security; "
"but that was only after you ran an update, so why not make the update query the Home button and refuse to install if it does not come back as working correctly followed by a message telling the person to go get their device serviced by a Apple certified tech?Because people wouldn't so it's still a security weakness and its still Apple who get the blame when security is breached. The most secure thing in the world is a box you cannot open. "
"I'm sure if you asked lots of people would they prefer an insecure phone that they can get the data off till they are able to get it repaired properly vs a secure phone that will never work again, they will opt for the former. "
"That would completely defeat its purpose as a security measure. Like it or not, the way to make it work correctly would be to make it brick instantly as it turns on. "
"My preferred fix would be instantly just lock the phone so it can only be wiped at reinstalled or unlocked by Apple. Self destruct the data, not the hardware.Not even brick the device. Just refuse to decrypt data on the device and display a message that bad hardware has been installed, please visit an Apple Store to get it fixed. > My preferred fix would be instantly just lock the phone so it can only be wiped at reinstalled or unlocked by Apple"
"My preferred fix is bricking it. Otherwise it's possible for someone to tamper with my phone, wipe it, and then trick me to restore from backup and continue using the phone without noticing that it's no longer secure."
"> That would completely defeat its purpose as a security measure. "
"no, you don't expect protection from an update that you don't already have installed. The bricking for security was a facet of the new update "
"Therefore doing a check (will this update immediately brick the device) is the sane thing to do prior to installing the update because at that point the user has no reason to expect that level of security. The whole point of the security enclave is that it destroys the part of itself that holds the key, making it resistant to tampering. Apple specifically cut the Jtag connectors to the chip so it cannot be read or written to externally - the chip destroying itself in case of unauthorised scanner being used is just a fantastic security measure, really that's how security should be done.If I understand it correctly, this was because the security hole was fixed in the new update. Previous versions of the OS did not check for this. Yep, the idea behind it is good, but how Apple executed this is just a huge middle finger to its customers.Coupled with their history of not being friendly to third party repair, it does imply a certain anti-competitiveness, whether intentional or not.Well, do you think it is unfair for Apple to assume that a piece of hardware that they installed in the device is present on that device? Especially since that particular device contains an encryption key.I think if an update has the ability to render a device inoperable if one of the parts is missing or broken it should check that part before allowing the update to be applied. What he said"
"That, or show a message every once in a while warning the user of the issue and, in short, explain what could happen and that bringing it in a shop could fix itTin foil hat time: What if Apple purposefully made their reaction to third party tampering severe to garner more attention toward encryption?As a privacy- and security-minded iPhone user I for one am very glad that they responded to that situation as they did. It was a gaping security hole and reacting as they did closed it securely. Had they not patched it hacking into any iPhone would simply require physical access for long enough to replace the Touch ID sensor."
"Edit: Added the previously-omitted words iPhone user.Yes, I too am glad that they didnt bend to the attempt at trying to exploit emotions in order to pressure them to bend to their will. Perhaps bricking the Touch ID functionality and not the entire fucking phone would have been smart.I know where you're coming from, but no, that would not have been smart. Secure systems will always come at the cost of convenience. "
"Whether we're talking about the convenience of being able to replace the Touch ID sensor in an unauthorized way or the convenience of being able to gain access to your phone for mass surveillance, more security will always come with side effects that make certain things less convenient, almost by definition.Perhaps reading the white paper and understanding the intricacies of the crypto system would have been smart. If you'd have done that you'd know such a thing isn't possible and would create unnecessary vulnerabilities. Security comes whole or not at all, there are no compromises in cryptography.And having access to the device to further tamper with the software til you figure out how to override touchID being disabled or entering new info about the component you just installed"
"Just because you don't understand something entirely and can curse on the internet about it, doesn't make you right "
"Trust in the people more educated then you fighting for your security Trusting other people to look after your security is exactly the wrong message...So you're gonna make your own phone hardware and software independently? You're gonna defend your home from military take over? "
"It's easy to act like you're capable of anything on your own when you've relied on everyone for your protection up to posting that comment How would bricking touch-id, and requiring The user to Enter Their passcode instead, be a Security problem?You're just thinking about yourself, ignoring all the government and military contracts Apple has. This is not about you.  Chances are you don't even own their phone. Apparently, It didn't work in the iPhone because the passcode was managed by the same hardware as the touchID. This was a change made in the iPhone 6 and continues. > Trust in the people more educated then you fighting for your security"
"isn't this ironic?"
"It would be if he was claiming to be more educated, but I don't believe he is!Indeed, because trust itself is not a secure mechanism of humanity.Its not as simple as Apple standing up for what they believe in. Apple is an international company which tries to sell in every market it can. If the FBI can get a back door into iOS that means two very bad things for American tech companies."
"1. The American government now has a backdoor in every iPhone sold world wide. Apple couldn't limit this just to the ones they sell in the US because then all one would need to do to get around this is by a phone from another market. No one likes the idea of a foreign government having access to their information. This would seriously hurt American businesses as non-Americans would be much more inclined to use alternatives or create their own competing devices."
"2. Now every government world wide can demand their own back doors. It becomes a logistical nightmare of keeping track of who can and who can't have access. Going back to point one how would Americans like it if the Russian government demanded Apple give them a back door to all Apple devices?Not only that, but if someone could exploit the system *they* would have access to that data as well. Three Secretaries of State have used unsecured servers to store official (work) emails. I can only imagine wtf they've got in their unofficial (non-work provided) phones. Or their spouses, or children. A fence is only as strong as its weakest link. It'd be silly to think those people aren't targets for attack. Another thing to consider, if they weaken security, then organizations that use their device for secure communications would likely drop them. It has market share implications as well. He has to be diplomatic in his message I suppose. But we all know for a fact that the FBI, NSA and quite possibly your local police station would abuse the hell out of this backdoor, whenever it suits their purpose."
"The rules with regards to search and seizure aren't as well defined with newer forms of technology, especially data. Or even if they are it seems as if authorities do not seem to care as long as they can't be caught. Nor do they necessarily care since the courts are not even willing to hear any arguments against such search and seizure."
"FBI will abuse this backdoor(if built) every chance it gets.I'm not the most tech savvy, however that's been my argument the entire time. If Apple does this once, they'll be doing it a million times. What's worse is they're building something that could cause world havoc. Again I'm not the smartest however all this talk over Hillary having sensitive documents in her personal email? If there was a back door couldn't it be breached on her phone and those emails brought to light? All I know is at 36 years old I've seen the internet go from a general idea to having access to it in our pockets, there is a lot of information that can be found from our phones, over the internet, to the point where it's frightening. We can all give what ifs, but that's the problem, the only way we'll figure out how bad this can get is if it does. Man I kinda miss the 1980s. Even if the FBI won't abuse it, and that is a big if, it will be leaked eventually.Apple is also being singled out.  If they comply, they will become a pariah and their iPhone sales will bleed away to every other smart phone vendor who still has secure data."
"...or have the other vendors already happily complied?> FBI, NSA and quite possibly your local police station would abuse the hell out of this backdoor"
"The problem for politicians is that they can't or won't see that a backdoor of this type isn't just for the good guys. As we've all seen, it doesn't take long to spread the details of how to exploit the backdoor once they are discovered.> He has to be diplomatic in his message I suppose."
"He could have said nothing and embraced the government's wishes... The rules for search and seizure are plenty defined for everyone's private property regardless of technological advancements. Which is why civil forfeiture is a thing... > But we all know for a fact that the FBI, NSA and quite possibly your local police station would abuse the hell out of this backdoor, whenever it suits their purpose."
"They probably would, but that's not the primary issue. Consider that Apple are basically being asked to *build a way to circumvent their security measures and hand it over to a third party*. It is just insanity - I would be surprised also if it didn't violate their terms of service, thus making it illegal. I agree with you when it comes to Local PD. State level government is still a bit like the wild west where depending on locality, all sorts of shit can happen. Chris Christie shut down the busiest bridge in the country, Alabama jails a clean 75% of it's black male population. "
"But with regards to the federal government, it has to be considered that the FBI, CIA, etc. has enough information on you, the day you turned 18, to ruin your life had they chosen to. They are the ones who gave you your SS number after all. Society has, and will probably always be, a system where the people trust the government and the powers that be to do right by them and when that power is abused, there are measures to correct the issue, like voting. The nuclear option for the people, if the situation gets as bad as some doomsday say-ers claim, would be a full overthrow of government where total chaos ensues, much like the French Revolution or the Chinese cultural revolution. "
"Because of this, I personally do not think that a government accessing our online data, changes the fundamental basis of how society runs.  I am against the government having our data for personal privacy reasons, for instance, they don't need to know if I told my girlfriend I loved her today, but as far as that abuse of data for the sake of imprisoning the innocent... I believe it won't change those metrics. Whether or not the fed is competent enough to keep our data safe from the hands of hackers, and dangerous individuals is a whole other argument.Why hasn't a new amendment been ratified to match the new technology age? So many were ratified in the 100 years after the first singing, and signings have since tapered off into nothingness. The amendments need to be reexamine and new ones ratified to match the current age of the world.Because polarization. It's getting harder and harder to pass bills and everyone has different interests. Many Democrats and Republicans in Congress are actually pro surveillance. > FBI would abuse the hell out of this backdoor"
"Maybe. Maybe not."
"But you can bet your ass the NSA/CIA/rogue agents inside the FBI sure would.Rogue nsa agents in the FBI sounds like a good spy thriller book. That this might actually be true is terrifyingYes they would, the US gov has previous, they simply cannot be trusted.>>     FBI would abuse the hell out of this backdoor"
"> "
"> Maybe. Maybe not."
"Uh... what? The FBI is as bad as the NSA when it comes to violating rights and ignoring the constitution, they're just less capable."

"http://www.engadget.com/2015/12/08/fbi-says-it-uses-zero-day-exploits/Slippery slope argument. It is equal to how the patriot act was targeted at terrorist but has been primarily used for domestic surveillance. A thing that is intended for one purpose, unless clearly restricted to that purpose, leads to a slippery slope ever expanding purposes due to legal precedence.Its less a 'slippery slope' and more of a 'we're already at the bottom of the canyon'. The FBI and US Gov use any means available regardless of the constitution or due process already- this would just give them another tool.Even when it's clearly restricted, it still ends up in common usage otherwise.  People cannot be trusted with omnisciency.  Period.Or any hacker that gets an idea of how it works. This could then be used in any world wide government to spy and detain people fighting against a country. I could hack a CEO phone and start insider trading, or they could have some weirdo stalk women easily with this. There are so many bad scenerios that can happen with a backdoor that it's insane.Weirdo stalk girls? Like what has proven to be rampant among the NSA of agents using their powers to gain unlawful access to exes and people of their interest?That's the quiet story that shocks me the most. The amount of corporate espionage you could have control of and using it to play the  market or steal from other companies. China is doing it, who says others aren't either?I suggest everybody will have to install an additional door to their home with one master key, and this key will be given to the FBI. The key will also open any safe inside the house. Sometimes there's a need to search the house or even save people in it, and it's very difficult when the owner is not around. This way, the FBI will have access, to be used only in legitimate cases and truthfully, based on the good intentions of the agents. For our own good. Politicians and public figures are excluded. Unless they have something against the FBI, in which case this key will be used to get information that might shape their agenda and priorities. Again, for the public's benefit.And if FBI is busy then perhaps a private bailbondsman can do it for them on a retainer? Sounds safe and easy enough.Damn. Standing up for the privacy of millions in the wake of adversity by your own government. Gotta respect that move."
"U.S Government: *Please..*"

The risk is the US government then cracks down on 'imported' foreign-owned hardware to strike back.Now I understand why they have built new 'Spaceship' headquarters. If something goes wrong they just take off and start to pay taxes on any planet they want.That may be true, but what is the or else in this scenario? Apple is one of the few companies to have deep enough pockets to fight the US Gov in court. And i think they would stand a decent chance of winning, too.> And i think they would stand a decent chance of winning, too."
"Uh, they already lost....?"
"That's kind of the whole thing. This thread wouldn't exist if they had won. They lost, and they're saying don't care, still won't do itWell thankfully we have a fully functioning court system, including a Supreme Court ready to hear this potentially important case.  I mean think of what a mess it would be if we have a SC with an even number of justices...The appeal court decision will stand if the SC is split."
"And there is already somes cases were some SC judges recuse themselves and the number of justices is even."
"Furthermore it will take quite some time to reach the SC.I hope everyone finds solidarity with Apple on this subject. It's infuriating what the government wants to do.[According to wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Writs_Act) it appears it has previously been used to get a small cellphone manufacturer to create a backdoor.  It'll be interesting to see what difference it makes now that it's Apple.  They can actually defend themselves from the FBI."
"[On October 31, 2014, the act was used by the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York to compel an unnamed smartphone manufacturer to bypass the lock screen of a smartphone allegedly involved in a credit card fraud.](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7012457256018582034)Someone needs to craft a clever FOIA to get the name of that manufacturer.I am usually no fan of apple, but my opinion of them just soared.I agree! I have always disliked the the marketing scheme, overpriced hardware, and the ego that comes with Apple. However, they are standing up to the encryption. This alone gives me motivation to buy an apple product. These days I actually find the ego thing to be the opposite, with Android users tending to be the ones talking down to iPhone users instead of the reverse. Then again I never see anyone discussing this outside of the internet.> the ego "
"Let's be honest, the android master race is much worse. Honestly, I got an iPhone recently over it. Compared to android, this thing is secure as *fuck*. iMessage uses end to end encryption by default, Touch ID is used extensively, four digit pins just aren't good enough and are disallowed, apps cannot access your location without asking and rarely get access when the app isn't running, unlike android which asks you once before installing, and gives whatever away to them. Individual apps don't have unfettered access to the system and can only background for 15 minutes after closure (with a few exceptions such as audio).  It blows my mind how much better the idle battery drain is, probably because it doesn't let apps track you however they please constantly. Screen on battery life is equivalent to Android. "
"I don't know if I would have liked it nearly as much with older software releases, but it's got feature parity with android nowadays. If you want emulators and such, you can build and install them for free now, assuming you have a bit of technical knowledge and a Mac. That's pretty much the only thing that's tempted me to jailbreak. You can do things like replace the keyboard and stuff nowadays. They've done this since the FBI asked for unencrypted iMessages a few years backFrom the BBC:"
">**The FBI has asked Apple to do two things.**"
">**Firstly, it wants the company to alter Farook's iPhone so that investigators can make unlimited attempts at the passcode without the risk of erasing the data.**"
">**Secondly, it wants Apple to help implement a way to rapidly try different passcode combinations, to save tapping in each one manually.**"
">**The FBI wants to use what is known as a brute force attack, trying out every combination until stumbling across the correct one and unlocking the phone.**"
"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35594245"
"So it doesn't seem like Apple can unlock the phone for the FBI, but they can modify it to make the chances of breaking into it easier.i understand why the FBI wants the first one (not that i agree)"
"But the second one? Those lazy fuckers. its only 10000 combinations get one of your interns to do it.Because the key is destroyed after a few brute force tries and at that point it's impossible to recover.  They want a custom os that removes that so they can brute force it.Except point 1 bypasses the wipe after N failed attempts! Did you even read? You are like the 8th person to bring this up.Can the passcode be more than 4 digits though?Seriously, 20 tries per minute should be doable, that means after 1 workday you've tried all combinations."
"1 workday. You could find plenty of people to do this for $200 over a day or two (plus on average they'd only need to try 5K to find it)."
"Meanwhile they want some Apple engineers to actually spend time on this at a fully loaded cost of upwards of $1500 a day to make that software. It shouldn't be too hard, but even if the engineer needs to spend 4 hours on it that's considerably more than the $200 bucks. And this is IT, that 4 hour estimate is probably on the conservative side."
"It's just insane - probably even just the people involved on the request side, lawyers, officers, ... that had to vet, read and edit the second point would've cost more than paying the $200.They are probably thinking they are saving taxpayer's $200..."
"> its only 10000 combinations get one of your interns to do it.  "
"Well, they are asking to make it so they can try all 10000 if I understand it correctly. Currently the phone doesn't allow that and will disable itself after repeated failures"
"you see, the issue is that after repeated failures the phone will wipe itself,"
"which is point 1, to disable that to allow for multiple attempts with no wiping."
"Which means that given point 1, anyone can sit down, spend a day and try all possible combinations of 0000 to 9999. "
"which means that they dont really need the point 2 but they are asking for it."
"So i can only surmise that they are extremely lazy."
"But of course they are lazy. since they are here harassing people for the easy way out instead of going out, talking to people and doing actual investigative work. >which means that they dont really need the point 2 but they are asking for it.  "
"Ok, I never gathered that they specifically wanted that on top of 1. But I know if I were asking for 1 I would also ask hey, can you fix 2 as well while you are at it? so I guess it makes sense."
"Yea, they probably thinking that too since they were already breaking down the door, might as well raid the fridge too.It can wipe itself after 10 tries.which is what point 1 is for, so it doesn't wipe itself."
"with that, you dont need point 2, just sit down, and try from 0000 to 9999."
"but nah, these lazy people who hasn't done any real investigative work can't manage that, they need an easier method. Lazy Lazy Lazy. > But the second one? Those lazy fuckers. its only 10000 combinations get one of your interns to do it."
"Except most devices are set up to erase themselves after 10 failed attempts.Except point 1 bypasses the wipe after N failed attempts! Did you even read? You are like the 7th person to bring this up.Yeah but as far as I remember from when I had an iPhone it locks after 3 tries, locking the phone for 5 minutes and that 'locked time' increases every time, meaning after  another try you would have to wait half an hour, then an hour and so on. I can't remember when it caps out though.I imagine that was part of the first change, remove both time and attempt limits.Presumably a removal of that system is included in the first thing mentioned.Uhm.... iOS now supports alphanumeric passcodes. It takes a little by of digging to find (settings, touchid and passcodes, change passcode, passcode options) but it's there. "
"Trying to brute force that with manual entry would take multiple lifetimes. it is confirmed that the phone in question uses a 4 digit numeric lock."
"iphone 5C without any security enclave, nor the security features of iOS 8 and above.It would be funny if they gave them  the first one but not the second.morbidly so.The first one is the key to the whole thing though. Electronic inputs can be as fast as you want but as soon as you hit a certain number of wrong guesses, the thing times out or starts erasing data. If you take away the guess limit/time out, you've broken the entire thing. FBI goes through all this shit, 5 years of court proceedings and 3 different presidents, finally Apple is forced to build an unlocker firmware which they drag out for another 8 months. FBI drooling and rubbing their hands together. So much juicy info. Been waiting so long. Today's the day. Slide to unlock... ok it begins, this could take a while... first up:"
"1111"
"success>Rather than asking for legislative action through Congress, the FBI is proposing an unprecedented use of the All Writs Act of 1789 to justify an expansion of its authority."
"Seriously? THe FBI is using an act, made in a time long long before even the invention of electrical lamps, to justify their demand for Apple to create a backdoor into iPhones? "
"That is unbelievably, undeniably, stupendously ridiculous.The current version was actually first passed in 1911. And the message behind all writs has nothing to do with technology, so it's really the same as saying that someone is invoking the 10 commandments or the constitution. We didn't have cell phones or TVs or automobiles when the constitution was written, but we still abide by those laws even when they involve phones, TVs, and cars.  This is not even the first case of the all writs act being used to try and unlock cell phones to get information from a suspect."
"It seems it was successfully used in a credit card fraud (of all things) in 2014. https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7012457256018582034"
"And they were harping on Apple to do it in December of 2014, a year BEFORE San Bernardino, again bringing up all writs. http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/12/feds-want-apples-help-to-defeat-encrypted-phones-new-legal-case-shows/"
"This feels like an opportunity for the gov't to once again bring up the act so that they can get a master key. You have to wonder if the efforts just won't go away -- repeating themselves tragedy after tragedy -- until finally the backdoor exists once people become afraid enough of society to let the gov't buttfuck 'em once again.Its a matter of physical vs digital.  It is considered 100% normal and reasonable for the government to ask a safe manufacturer or locksmith to open a lockbox/safe.  Its considered sane and reasonable for a court to order someone to open there locked filing cabinet, or to acquire a mastery key to open the cabinet from its manufacturer."
"Yet when it comes to cellphones and in general digital documents people start losing there mind.  Its suddenly completely unreasonable to ask someone to unlock there cellphone, even with a court order.  Its suddenly completely unreasonable to approach the manufacturer to unlock a cellphone even with a court order.  Yet if that were a safe, filing cabinet, or lockbox people wouldn't even think twice about it.  "
"To this end encrypting your documents should not somehow grant immunity to prosecution, or make all information that was encrypted get thrown out of court.  "
"Yet by the same token, the government can't just walk in your house and open your safe, while theoretically with backdoors, artificial access, etc they could access your digital documents without ever notifying you directly or completely without your knowledge.  Doing that would obviously be illegal, but people still fear it anyhow.  "
"I know my opinion and points are not popular on reddit, but at the end of the day encrypted documents should legally be treated the same way as physical documents/items in a locked container.  "
"I disagree with you, but this is a well reasoned argument that I consider often. I genuinely think we would be as a net gross more safe if the Feds were given back door access to popular services. However, I think of encryption as more of a first amendment issue than anything. What is encryption but a language to store information? And then at that point, the fifth amendment should cover any argument to be forced to explain the language. Check out the Bernstein vs US and Hubbell vs US Supreme Court cases.  For a start, the courts are already able to force people to unlock their cellphones, just like they are able to force people to unlock their safes. "
"This is more like the Gov telling the biggest alarm manufacturers that all alarm systems must have a single master code that disables them, which 'only the police' will have."
"Sooner rather than later, that code will be available to everyone who wants it. Do manufacturers actually have master keys for top-end safes? I am struggling to find any useful reading on the topic of government safe raiding. "
"I can imagine manufacturers advising the FBI on structural weaknesses of the safe so they can brute force it, but a safe with a backdoor sounds like a very, very bad safe."
"If everyone stored private data in physical safes made by apple, it would be equally as bad for apple to build the safe with a backdoor, because as soon as somebody with malicious intent notices the backdoor, absolutely everybody has their safes compromised. "
"It's a lot harder to abuse seizing a safe or locked container because it requires physical access.  I think the concern is that, with the internet and digital age, a backdoor means a vulnerability that anyone could abuse from anywhere (rogue nation state, hackers, terrorists, etc).  It also has financial repercussions.  What company would trust a product that has been deliberately rendered compromised?  How will this affect Apple's iPhone sales, which would directly affect the US economy?  So, this has both security and financial repercussions, which is significant enough to have a public debate over.But if the safe maker creates a safe that even he doesn't know how to crack then the request becomes unreasonable. He can't crack it if he can't crack it.This IS the difference between physical vs digital. If the government asks for a way to unlock a strongbox or filing cabinet, that does not allow someone from ANYWHERE else in the world to reverse engineer and gain access everyone else's filing cabinets."
"The analogies aren't even the same. These devices, iPhones and other smartphones, contain vast information about a person. It's not only a matter of the government breeching privacy, it's that it leads to every digital attacker gaining an ability to track and abuse this power at will. Physical goods are not the same as the security of a digital product because one does not have to have physical proximity to access it."
"If a backdoor is created, anyone will be able to access it, track you, listen to you, and abuse this. It is something that the NSA is already abusing with gathering information about every single internet transaction wherever they can just because they can. How is this new power not going to be abused when it could then be done so easily to millions of people?> encrypted documents should legally be treated the same way as physical documents"
"Consider the difference between using physical master key and digital one. Specifically how easy it is to copy the latter. So no: they shouldn't.yeah but forcing people to crack their safes is not the same deal as forcing people to give access to all their data- especially since merely the existence of the ability to access all your data means it's guaranteed to be abused and be out there in the wild.  "
"imagine your local police officer listening in to your private voice mails/text messages just on the suspicion of you doing something illegal. that's the endgame here not privacy or whatever you're talking about.  "
"also it's very clear now that if you give the govt the ability to do something it's not a question of them following due process, it's do whatever they want ask questions when someone blows the whistleYour analogy is wrong and I will tell you why."
"Yes, no one blinks an eye when those requests for *physical* access are made. They are reasonable precisely because access will always remain physical. This matter is different in the digital world. To stay with your analogy: the FBI needs a warrant to go into your house and open your safe for the documents you hold there. One could argue that they could theoretically enter your house for that purpose without that warrant but that would clearly be unconstitutional. Moreover, you would be able to know if someone had entered your home to open your safe. What the FBI wants here is to be able to view the contents of your safe without anyone ever knowing they did so. The implication is of course that the barrier to do so *without a warrant* is immensely lowered and this opens the door to all sorts of abuse.Would you mind if I look at any and all files on your computer and on your phone? If you allow a backdoor, I'll get in there eventually.Are you the hacker known as 4chan?It's not surprising though. Thankfully it seems Apple is willing fight it. That Supreme Court nomination is looking more and more important.I suspect the PR war is even more important. Apple seems to be making good early gains in this case but overall the government is still winning: If you don't give us what we want you side with terrorists, etc.You didn't say it, but lets not forget that despite all the other reasons reddit hates Scalia he was actually on the correct side of this issue:"
"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/antonin-scalia-fighter-privacy-rights-fourth-amendmentIt seems like a paradox at first, but conservatives are normally against this sort of thing, while liberals are for it. Eh, it's not like it is that cut and dry. This does not seem like an issue that can be easily put in a spectrum of conservative -- liberal.IIRC all of the republican candidates except for Paul were pro backdoors when asked during the first debate.[Hillary Clinton](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/12/hillary-clinton-wants-manhattan-like-project-to-break-encryption/) also is in favor of breaking encryption standards.My favorite part."
"The government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone. But that's simply not true. Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices. In the physical world, it would be the equivalent of a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks -- from restaurants and banks to stores and homes. No reasonable person would find that acceptable.**Tim Cook with the reverse Taylor Swift!**"
"Nice to explicitly see They asked us to create a backdoor. Has this ever occurred in Silicon Valley(other than a canary)?"
"Hope others will stand up, this ought to bring awareness.It makes me wonder if they were ordered not to reveal it, and if not, I wonder why not? The government has been so free with orders to suppress exactly this kind of disclosure, it is hard to believe they wouldn't have applied it in this case.Terrorism cases are highly public and the locked phone has been a public issue as a result. It suddenly becoming evidence could not have been hidden.It happened with a secure email provider called  [Lavabit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavabit) but they said they'd rather shut down than give in. So they shut down!Not in silicon valley that I know of. But Linus Torvalds said he'd been approached by multiple governments.That's kinda interesting given Linux being open source. People would just compile from an old copy of the source codeIf they've approached Linus and he outed wgat happened makes you wonder what exploits are purposefully in MS software.

And ultimately, we fear that this demand would undermine the very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect.   "
"This right here is the 4th Amendment. Allowing access into our private information is a direct violation. The federal government has no right and this is why Apple refused.

Incidentally, the piecemeal permission system he talks about in that video (as well as full-disk encryption) are just now being made mandatory on Android Marshmallow (5+ years later).And most devices are going to suffer big performance penalties for the new mandatory encryption.

I can foresee a lot of Is your Android device slow? Here's one quick fix!! articles popping up in the near future. Just a heads up, modern SSDs have hardware-accelerated AES-256, and can run at full speed. "
"See all the latest Samsung SSDs. FDE performance issues came from a time when it was done with software only.not only SDDs, but modern intel CPUs have hardware accelerated AES, there's almost no difference in performance Yes, modern SSDs do have hardware accelerated encryption. But almost all Android phones do not, as they do not use SSDs in the same sense as your computer. 95% of phone's use eMMC, which is a long evolved derivative of the original SD card standard pretty much. "
"AES acceleration is included in the ARMv8 architecture, which Android phone's have just started to get in the last year or so. However, Apple includes a dedicated encryption engine that sits between the memory and storage on the phone that is faster than the ARMv8 instructions could ever wish to be. It's shit like this which is why the spec argument between iPhones and Android phones is pointless. Apple do a lot to get the most out of the hardware, more than just throwing more cores or more Mhz at it. > And most devices are going to suffer big performance penalties for the new mandatory encryption. Android manufactures have been skimping out on quality NAND chips and controllers for years."
"The situation with encryption on Android is quite bad because it just does full disk encryption in the kernel. It's slow and not very secure in the grand scheme of things. "
"Apple's phones do AES256 in hardware on the DMA path between flash storage and main memory. They can encrypt the disk as well as individual files on top of it without significant loss of performance. The iOS kernel doesn't even handle anything relevant to encryption anymore; iPhones have an isolated coprocessor running its own OS for interfacing with the encryption hardware.It's funny how apple adopted ARMv8 almost a year before the rest of the industry when they already had hardware accelerated encryption since the 3GS. The dedicated hardware still smokes the ARM implementation though. It shocks me this isn't the industry standard yet. Apple buying PA Semi back in 2008 feels super prescient right now.The loudest advocates for encryption backdoors seem to be republicans who use the argument, If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear. I suspect it was intentional that Cook essentially stated, If we defeat encryption, only terrorists and criminals will have encryption and law abiding citizens will be vulnerable. He paraphrased the If we ban guns, only criminals well have guns argument so the target audience understand it. Brilliant."

If only we had one of those....  /sIt's more of, I like the status quo, and I won't ever be fighting it. Screw everyone that might ever even try and fuck with it down the road.I like that you make this argument, because I like to see encryption and 2nd amendment linked. In my head, if the second amendment exists to safeguard the rights of citizens to defend themselves, including against their own government; and if the US government, many times in the past, has classified strong encryption as a munition and controlled its export, I believe that encryption needs to be defended on the grounds of the second amendment."
"Encryption is a defensive weapon, but it is a weapon.I invite anyone who uses the nothing to hide argument for encryption to take a dump with the door open.

Instructions unclear, poop stuck in ceiling fanOnly El Chupanibre can help me now. I've never noticed the hypocrisy there before but you're absolutely right. If wanting privacy means you have something to hide, then wanting a gun means you plan on shooting somebody. "
"Ironic too how second amendment activists claim the right to bear arms as important for overthrowing any future tyrannical government, when these days reliable and widely available encryption technology would be considerably more useful than guns should that need ever arise. If the data is encrypted, how would a new version of iOS be able to decrypt the data?They just need the right 4 digit code. So Apple install a new version of iOS without a limit on attempts. The FBI then try out 10000 combinations until they unlock the phone and view the contents. The idea being that custom Apple-signed iBoot software could (theoretically - there is some disagreement from Apple on this point) be written, allowing one to bypass password guess limits / automatic device erasure for failed passwords, thus allowing for the possibility of a brute force attack.> allowing one to bypass password guess limits / automatic device erasure for failed passwords"
"In the larger picture, you'd think that Apple will build the limits and deletion into hardware in the next iThings, so that an alternative firmware would not be enough to do the job.The iPhone 5s and newer use hardware for the time limiting. :)Unfortunately, the firmware on that hardware is still what decides how the time limited works, so we're not quite there yet.

"They already did, but this is an iPhone 5C with an Apple A6. The Apple A7 phones and later have an isolated coprocessor running its own OS that handles security and the timeout is implemented there. The iOS kernel has no direct access to it anymore. I just wonder how they'd install this custom version of iOS. Far as I remember you can't just plug the phone in to a computer and upgrade, you need to unlock the phone first. You'd also need to trust a new computer before the phone even communicates with it."
"You could put the device in to recovery/DFU mode but I don't think you can install iOS as a n upgrade from there, it would wipe the data they're trying to access.Remove flash chip, dump data, update data needed to run custom iOS. It would be more of a dual boot I imagine.Perhaps they have some kind of serial interface on the board that can circumvent these modes.Ah, thanks; that makes much more sense!If we continue to allow efforts of government agencies and out-of-touch politicians to weaken encryption with the justification of fighting terrorism, then the terrorists have already won. Terrorism is not merely killing for the sake of killing, but seeks to strike fear into the hearts and whittle away the freedoms of the target population. "
"Regarding the San Bernardino attack, the investigation *can* continue without targeting the privacy of every other electronics consumer - tracing connections through interviews, house warrants, and other traditional means will almost certainly provide no less evidence than engineering a weakness in software in *suspicion* of the presence of some clues.

"They would immediately use this for economic spying and worse.I'm a hardcore FOSS user, but this sort of stance really does make me trust Apple. I respect them for handing over the data that they had when given a reasonable, just, legal order. I also respect them for taking a stand against an unjust, dangerous order. This is the sort of stance the major players need to be taking if a culture of protecting users privacy is to be adopted by all the other tech companies out there. Nothing but love for Apple here.I've been wanting to move to FOSS for a long time, but Apple's stance on issues like this is what keeps my trust in them and makes my probably inevitable move a less critical priority.As someone who hates Apple, wow... Tim Cook just earned so much of my respect with this.I've never understood the hate or even the need. The reality, as I've seen it play out over the last 15 years, is really just divisional marketing in a limited market."

People bought into it and they became the biggest phone vendor by volume in the world for a while. Not only doing well but they obliterated other Android resellers."
"Other companies are famous for competing in this way.> The government is asking Apple to hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customers -- including tens of millions of American citizens -- from sophisticated hackers and cybercriminals. The same engineers who built strong encryption into the iPhone to protect our users would, ironically, be ordered to weaken those protections and make our users less safe."
"Major props to Apple for standing up to this.>But now the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone."
"Very powerful words. Good on them for being so direct on this issue.*Now* Samsung needs to copy Apple.Thank you, TimThey should show Tim Cook's letter on the front page of apple.com, not some obscure customer-letter page."
"Well I guess media will pick it up pretty quickly."
"It's the fourth link under the header on the home page.They kinda did. www.apple.com, it's on one of the 4 items below the big header.Kind of happy with my choice of phone today.So fucking bad ass!Not the first time an arm of the US gov has done this. "
"Usually against smaller companies, but if you look, you'll be surprised how many big US multinational companies have had the same strong armed request and threat and complied out of fear (financially, criminally and politically). "
"Not many took this stance and survive unscathed, so I tip my hat to him. Goodluck."
"Most end up with their business ruined, bankrupt and sometimes even criminal charges and somehow end up dead or in hiding shortly afterwards."
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LavabitTim Cook has so much of my respect for standing as a crusader for encryption and privacy. "
"Even though I'm not an Apple guy, they're currently the only company actively pushing this issue and not just with words but they're actually building products and software which supports this. Out of curiosity, why couldn't the FBI just build the backdoor themselves?  I'm specifically asking about this phone in question.  How would they get this backdoor onto an already locked phone that even apple isn't suppose to be able to access currently?The FBI can't create iOS from scratch in order to build a back door into it. "
"The fbi is, from my understanding, is essentially asking the new version of iOS to be built by Apple to include code to remove the limit of times a pin code can be attempted prior to it erasing and resetting as per current iOS protocol. Removing this feature would allow the fbi to simply brute force 4 digit pins until it's unlocked. They would also need the use of Apple's security certificates to sign the update and their server infrastructure to pass the update to the phone IF they somehow built their own firmware.While I'm no fan of Apple and it's past actions, I applaud Tim for this statement. Apple just gained some massive cred today. For once I'm glad that I'm using their phones.People ask me why I trust certain corporations like Apple with my data over the government. It's pretty simple, Apple has a financial interest in protecting my data, the government does not. This is a fantastic step forward against the moves the US Gov is taking to bypass encryption."
"The standard consumer does not read tech blogs. They don't read forums such as these and journals on the pros and cons of strong encryption on personal devices. They buy gadgets, and use them."
"When someone like Tim Cook is so open about the intentions of Apple in this case, people will listen. He has the opportunity to speak directly to the consumers and be heard by a much wider audience, unlike the tech blogs which have been saying the same thing."
"It's by getting these consumers to be pro-encryption that we can ensure it's here to stay. Tech geeks like us can care all we want but if the standard consumer doesn't understand why it's so important then it's easy to spread misinformation or for people to simply not care when it's gone.I am a pretty staunch Google supporter and have stayed away from Apple products for a while. If Apple wins this fight I will buy an i something just to show my support. Your turn Google/Alphabet. Time to step the fuck upHoly SHIT. This is an amazing show of integrity from Apple and Tim Cook.This is the best course of action to bring the issue of what the gov't is doing to the surface. The average American probably wouldn't batter an eyelid if their response wasn't this big.Data Security is definitely something Apple take pride in."
"I sit here waiting for the next jailbreak to fiddle around inside, but on the other side of the fence it's their, mine and all consumer's worst nightmares for reasons/posts like this. The exploit being used for something other than just an enhancement platform.I guess the US government will have to decide which they love more: invading the privacy of their citizens or sucking corporate dick.Apple just went up a few points in my book. Taking this threat and telling the people about it up front. Does the government not understand that compromising security on the iPhone would destroy apple? If (when) this masterkey version of iOS got into the wrong hands, the iPhone would no longer be secure for anyone. People would be tossing iPhones in the trash. It would be ruinous for apple. "
"I understand that what the FBI is asking for isn't a simple backdoor access code, but the average user won't take the time to understand the difference. Oh the iPhone isn't secure? Better toss it."
"I'm happy to see Cook taking this stance on privacy. I hope enough people care about this to get some definitive protections against the government prying into our devices.I wholeheartedly agree. I am very happy to see Cook taking this stance on privacy, which has become a vital, if overlooked, necessity in this day and age. I never have much to say about apple, but I have to applaud their integrity with this decision, regardless of how much these decisions are self beneficial. As much as i dislike apple i deeply respect what they're doing hereNot a fan of Apple or its products, but my respect for them shot way up. This was a huge. Props to them for standing up when it mattered the most. My position on them definitely changed in the positive light The people that support backdoor access do not fully understand why encryption is needed and what serious repercussions can happen.  Don't let the government scare us out of our freedom like the Patriot Act.  Educate yourself on what encryption is all about and why it's a necessity and you'll understand why creating a backdoor is such a bad idea.Cook deserves much respect for this response.I have to admit I gained a bunch of respect for Apple just now."
"Earlier today I thought They just want to remove the security system that prevents brute force attempts. Not actually remove the encryption so its okay. This slapped me back to my senses and helped me to realize this is NOT okay."
"Apple allowing this would be saying it is okay to weaken security because something is bad enough That is the kind of crap that got the Patriot Act passed and the police thinking that excessive force is okay. "
"This IS a real slippery slope. Not some fake They coming for our guns! slippery slope the gun nuts are always saying whenever someone wants to pass a gun control measure."
"So I applaud apple and hope they take this to the highest court. The FBI should do its job and do a complete investigation (The one they didn't do when they left a frakking crime scene open to the media!) not work on eroding civil liberties hoping for a quick fix.TIL that Apple encrypts your iPhone to the point they put the data out of our own reachAs an Android user, I must say...BRAVO. "
"Makes me wonder if Samsung already has a backdoor in my Note 4....I don't like their products, but I applaud them for their stance on this matterDevil's advocate here. How could we ever know if a backdoor was created? Couldn't Apple publicly refuse but secretly allow access to the government? Our nation's history is full of lies and scandals, why couldn't this just be another?More than likely it would be found. That information would then be used to blackmail the company or sold to competition to use as proof and ruin Apple or others."
"The backdoors can be found, especially since there are a lot of people out there actively tracking things like this down. I love watching Defcon videos and gotta figure a lot of things like this would come out there for certain.Yeah I've pretty much read the same thing from a lot of people. Backdoors are very hard to hide especially in something as popular as an iPhone.The feds should have directly contacted the Chinese for assistance in this matter.Can you smell what the TIM is cookingI hope other companies use this to make a stand as well.>All that information needs to be protected from hackers and criminals who want to access it, steal it, and use it without our knowledge or permission. "
"I think I'd actually be more worried about government and law enforcement than I would be hackers and criminals. The latter might have the ability to steal your money or identity but the former can flat out destroy your life!*Gets the popcorn ready*Apple giving the finger to the over intrusive government and exposing their legal tactic in doing so... Using an Act from 1798?? Seriously?? "
"If they had a legitimacy to what they are doing, they would pass a modern day law. I own zero Apple products and I am about to run to the store.....Fucking glad that I only use iPhones and buy the same for my family members as well.Tomorrow's submission: Tim Cook held in contempt of ~~FBI~~ court and arrested by US Marshalls.Can someone ELI5 what the call to action is?  I don't understand the purpose of the letter...Federal government wants into the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters. Apple says that literally can't be done. FBI wants Apple to build that back door from scratch. Apple says fuck that, knowing that it sets a precedent and the code to do this couldn't possibly be kept safe or even reserved only for terrorism investigations.All the people saying they respect apple now, or they hate them but agree on this... This sort of thing is par for the course in my view. This is the apple I've always known and this is no surprise at all. "
"The way they pushed recycling, reducing harmful materials, and other noble causes when there was no financial incentive to do so. They do things because they're the right thing to do. [Mad props.](http://i.imgur.com/VfaGh9P.gif?noredirect) Not an Apple fan but I definitely admire Tim Cook for that.What is the FBI claiming they may need from the phone that they don't have?   Sounds like they are trying to use this as an excuse to force Apple to give them a tool they have wanted for yearsThings that affected this; Guns and Religion"
"Things that didn't affect this; Encryption and Tim CookOh shit, I hope Bill Gates gets behind this. That'd be huge.i dislike apple as a company but this is the correct response. Praise should be given for this decision.i think my respect for apple just went up a notch(android user)"
"This man has just earned my absolute respect. If this is indeed the way he's proceeding, and this isn't a ruse to keep the public at bay while some back room deals are being worked out, he's a model for other companies to follow.Today I hate Apple a little less.Imagine you live in a home built by a large home builder. Toll Brothers, Ryan Homes, Ryland Homes, etc..... Imagine the FBI were trying to get a criminal in one of these homes. So they turn to the home builder and say Give us a key that opens the backdoor to every home you've ever built. But we only want to use it this once, even though we will keep the key afterwards. Would you find that acceptable? I would not.Oh wow, Props to Apple for doing that. Respect! Maybe my next phone will be an iphone. If iPhone isn't your thing, turn on full Disk encryption. Just note though. Apple, as with every other company, has to hand over information to the FBI if they request it. They have no choice. The issue here is that the FBI wants an easy way to decrypt it. So while companies like Google may have a bad rep for cooperating, its not like they had a choice, and they too are firm on the no backdoors policy. It's just that Apple is more outspoken about it because they are the first to implement full disk encryption as standards in their phones and do it retroactively via updates. So they encounter these requests more so. I'm no fan of Apple in general, but support their stance on this issue.Good for Apple, MS are also fighting the good fight too, the US want access to MS accounts outside the US and issue court orders to do just that!!The FBI is attempting to use a 227 year old law (1789) to justify forcing a private company to create a software backdoor in 2016...exposing the private information of millions of US citizens and even individuals abroad. This would include access to our health data, location tracking, text messages, etc. Kudos to Apple for standing up against tyranny; let's hope they prevail and prevent a precedent from being established which would effectively demolish the final barrier of privacy we have left.Title is a tad misleading, FBI wants a backdoor in all iPhones, not just getting into this one person's phone. Good for Cook and Apple for saying noI read that they only want in this phone. They want a way to brute force the password. They want Apple to change the software in THIS phone so they can do that. I'm OK with them wanting in this phone as it's proven they are terrorists. Anymore info gained from this phone could be valuable. However I think Apple should be the ones to get the data and then send that to the FBI and not just allow the FBI to do the 'cracking'. Once they find a way in, fuck knows what they'll get upto. At least you can trust Apple to not do this on all other phones, once they have the data the FBI want.Tim Cook, you really earned my respect!"
"https://giphy.com/gifs/little-jeter-yCAoGdVUCW5LWPLAYER 2 HAS ENTERED THE GAME>Customers expect Apple and other technology companies to do everything in our power to protect their personal information, and at Apple we are deeply committed to safeguarding their data."
"https://m.popkey.co/1c786e/kvKXd.gifThis is nice. But nowhere does it say we won't or we refuse. It simply says they're asking us to, this tool does not exist yet, and we think it's a dangerous thing. This almost reads as a canary. As in, this is what we're being asked to do... now you know."
"The article says they've complied with every FBI request (and then some). And remember under things like the Patriot Act, these companies aren't ALLOWED to tell you they've given the government access to your data. We'll see how things go, but this seems like nice PR, allowing them to seem well-intended (and maybe they are) while ultimately going along with it (and maybe they feel they have no choice)."
"It's really important that users control their data. Decentralization, encryption, etc. If you are funnelling your data to one company (Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Dropbox, whoever), signing huge EULAs you don't understand/read, using code that can't be understood, that you don't control... then we can't be surprised when these things happen. People want everything to be easy and don't care as long as it works. But the power we're giving to these companies, and governments around the world, is very very dangerous.People don't care. Look at how many people use Chrome, for example.It's a sad day when I completely agree with Apple on something...  Fuck you, government. If a lone analyst could sit inside the army and take off with all top-secret data, imagine the story repeating itself over at FB(Ayyeee) with all your personal data.Could this create a similar scenario to Lavabit? If this goes all the way to the end, is one of the options for apple to shut down in order to maintain its stance?Something related to the subject of device encryption. [This](https://theintercept.com/2015/11/15/exploiting-emotions-about-paris-to-blame-snowden-distract-from-actual-culprits-who-empowered-isis/) may provide further insight into what the government is trying to do."
"Damn. Props to apple for thisMajor Respect to him for standing up to his beliefs o7Why do they need to oppose this?  I was under the impression that they couldn't do it in the first place.  They can still update the phone to a new insecure OS, and then hack that new OS."
"With the current OS/software/hardware/etc they can't.Could someone explain how this is any different from trying to gain access to an encrypted hard drive?"
"Why can't you take the memory out of the phone, clone the encrypted data, then do as many brute force attacks as you want?"
"Any info appreciated!The encryption on a hard drive can be easily brute forced since it is not protected by an outer layer of security. It can be copied bit by bit or attached to a third party computer which then can try to decrypt the file system for as long as it wants. The iPhone on the other hand protects its file system; it is only accessible via the touch interface and strongly limits the amount of tries you have to enter a password. It also provides the option to erase the system if the password is entered incorrect ten times."
"Imagine your HardDrive in a save that you have to open by punching in a code and if you enter the wrong number ten times it will nuke the hard drive inside..."
"Why they don't just repsond we don't have the means to unencrypt this phone? done.Because they've not been asked to directly decrypt it, and AFAIK it's established fact that they *do* have the ability to do what they have been ordered to do.That is what they normally reply with when ordered to decrypt the device.  This time the court ordered a custom firmware be created so that the FBI could attempt to guess the phones passphrase as many times and as quickly as they wanted so they could gain access.  Also the new firmware would remove the auto wipe after 'x' attempts protection.Wow. Um yeah what he said. The next thing he should do is publicly call out other tech giants to take the same stance.Tim Cook is referring to 2 different things and I'm unclear of what is actually going on here :"
"* a master key which would be installed on a new iOS version which would presumably be usable as soon as the user decrypts content (a master key is by itself unusable if it wasn't used to encrypt the key to the data and if the current protection is well designed it can't happen until users decrypt their data)."
"* a way to input passwords at a faster pace than through the interface."
"Like he explains the first is a technical and social aberration, but the second is a different beast and he doesn't explain why it's such a bad thing. I'm even surprised the FBI needs Apple to circumvent the GUI and input passwords directly. If they can't it's more security through obscurity than real security : if you get at the flash content (which should be possible, I don't think iPhone are destroying themselves if they are opened) and know the data layout you should be able to copy the data elsewhere and brute-force the password. There could be a TPM device in there protecting the password though : is the US government requiring the TPM device to be backdoored too?Bad things await us frensAs long as Apple publicly supports this type of consumer security, they've got me as a customer. God damn it US Gov, see what you did, you made Tim Cook sad.Not a big Apple guy, but good for them. Encryption shouldn't be lessened. GG Tim Cook. Holy shit, i thought this was all talk from some some sincerely stupid mother fuckers. The judge that ordered this needs to be disbarred immediately. "
"Everyone should encrypt their phones right now.Well I hope if apple does cave the will tell the world so people can avoid that IOS update. Its small shred of hope, but it would be nice. I'm very impressed Mr. Cook. You came off extremely heartfelt and trustworthy. I'm wondering, if this attack was just a part of a larger plan and going through imessage could have revealed/prevented this what would happen?Don't like Apple but I like this stance they're taking. >While we believe the FBI's intentions are good, it would be wrong for the government to force us to build a backdoor into our products. "
"So they might not have a choice to do it.. people say usa has democracy. FBI and USA government have been doing such things for a long time. apple will eventual give up. there is no please. do it or you are fucked.The government already has access to our health records and financial data.  The government can even track cash spending on a limited basis (newer bills are chipped).  "
"Anything uploaded to iCloud will be turned over with a subpoena and can be hacked without a subpoena (Did you people forget about The Fappening already?)."
"If you do anything on the Internet, the NSA has it in their databases."
"The letter sounds great but the only thing protected by your phone's encryption are photos not uploaded to the Internet and data stored in apps with no Internet connectivity."
"If you believe owning an iPhone/iPad or an encrypted Android secures your data from anyone but petty thieves, don't kid yourself.It's in Apple's interest to refuse to provide a backdoor. Otherwise, their products will stop selling in 250 other countries over the world. Even American citizens would probably switch away from iOS on the day such a backdoor is created. Ultimately, Apple would probbably have to close its Phone business.The government is like the creepy guy who tells the girl it's just the tip.Dear FBI,"
"Fuck off. "
"Love Always,"
"Tim.Serious question. What can the government do if Apple engineers just shrugs and say we don't know how to do it?I wonder if the FBI would allow US president or other high level politician to own an iPhone with a known backdoor.Secret Service only let Obama have a limited Blackberry after a whole lot of back and forth. I remember there was an episode of that Bear Grylls show where Obama was with him, Bear suggested they take a selfie by a waterfall and Obama said he had to borrow a phone from a member of his staff because he was not allowed to have oneThe cynic in me worries that this is just a PR move while they do indeed comply with the demands of the FBI in some way or another, but I'm gonna try to push that aside for now and say, good job Tim Cook. If this is honest and sincere then I'm very impressed despite not being much of an Apple guy myself.I think he should have ended it with saying We dont negotiate with terrorists"
"That would have gotten the message across.I've never been a fan of Apple. Somewhere between the image of the average Apple user and the company's marketing and/or business decisions, I've found countless arguments opposing the use of their products."
"But, this. I don't simply like this. I *respect* this. I may not get rid of my smartphone tomorrow but I am paying attention. And if the world we are heading towards involves governments being so shamelessly indifferent to a citizen's privacy, Apple may just have won a customer by taking such a clear stance on this.Really gonna need a 9 the justice who supports strong encryptionMore back bone than other tech companies."
"In a world where the vast majority of American's aren't educated in the relatively complex mathematics of data security, how can we expect people to even understand the implications of the FBI's request. I guess my biggest concern here is the implication that this *is* possible, even if Apple are refusing to do it."
"The technical specialists at the FBI know what the roadblocks are and what's needed to bypass them. Getting Apple to write the software is the easy route. The hard route (writing it themselves) is still available and they will probably take it."
"What this also exposes - not just for Apple, but probably all mobile OSes - is an inherent security flaw where the security of your data is directly reliant on the security roadblocks placed in the software. That is, that the security of the data can be massively weakened simply by replacing the OS."
"It would seem fundamental now that the two must be interlinked and go as far as encrypting the entire OS along with the data such that you either decrypt everything or you brick the device. Simply, it shouldn't be possible to replace the OS without having authority to access to the data."
"How many smart phones use hardware security modules in addition to data encryption?"
"Edit: To use the door/key analogy, while they don't have a master key, they have implicilty confirmed that it is theoretically possible to replace the entire locking mechanism with one that's way easier to pick, without opening or damaging the door."
"That's a fundamental design flaw.As much as I hate their walled-garden app ecosystem preventing me from developing without Apple hardware or paying through the nose for a rental server just for compilation, it *does* give them a hell of a lot of control to protect average users. Good on you Tim!!! I hate Apple, but damn, I really love Tim Cook.Very well stated. I may not support Apple in much, but Tim Cook is amazing for standing up for Apple users. Apple may be the only company that can lead in such an endevor. Nothing against Microsoft, but I personally doubt a similar message from Satya could have as much sway behind it.I hope they get what they wantWhich party? If Apple, me too. Maybe it's just due to politics but the whole article sounds like it would actually be possible to do it and decrypt an existing so called secure iPhone. If the iPhone really is secure, no discussion would be needed as nothing could be done to encrypt it."
"But how is the iPhone actually secured? A 4 digit pin isn't exactly hard to break. Just need a summer student trying out all combinations in a smart way."
"http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2012-09/infographic-day-fastest-way-crack-4-digit-pin-numberHe could have just shortened it to fuck da policeHe should make some more donations to congressmen. They have the IRS covered already, a couple of extra mil should take care of the Feds....He better have his mechanic check his brake lines. I have an iphone and really like it. That being said, is it really that hard to believe that there isn't already a backdoor in ios and this is just for publicity?If they have the possibility to unlock an encrypted device even if they have to create a tool that does not exist yet, doesn't that mean there is already a backdoor?Just yesterday two City Watch officers beat up a citizen, drove him to a forest and threatened with death after he pointed out that they were breaking the law. Now they are in jail mostly thanks to the fact that he recorded the incident on his iPhone. They tried accessing the phone to delete the video but failed. "
"Edit: Happened in Warsaw, Poland. They are innocent until proven otherwise, but that video is a pretty solid proof. And City Watch is not a police in case anyone wonders. It's a glorified security without guns. "
"Could Apple use The First Amendment as a defense against the court order compelling it to backdoor iOS?"
"https://plus.google.com/+CodyCasterline/posts/Cx21oSbbo4wWhat prevents people from brute-forcing the memory directly instead of using some intentionally limited UI? Does not sound that hard with only 10k key permutations...I wish there a presidential candidate that held such views... Oh, wait...Time to post a scene from one of my favorite movies, a Man for All Seasons: https://youtu.be/PDBiLT3LASk"
"Can someone explain this to me? The FBI requests a new version of iOS to be installed on a single phone that was involved in the attack.  What, exactly, does this mean?  If the phone is locked, how will they install new software on it without unlocking?  People are suggesting an update to iOS that will get pushed-out to all users, but contain a backdoor that is specific to that one particular device -- but how will the new iOS version be installed without unlocking first?I believe you can force an update to a device. I don't know the specifics. The Update wouldn't be available to everybody. Only to FBI for them to use when they need to decrypt someone's device. Automatic software update just for that phone, maybe? Apple would surely have the tools to force the phone to update with or without its passcode The update would allow it to be unlocked. But just in forcing Apple to make that happen, the update may as well be put on everyone's phones for all Apple's customers are concerned. It would mean our data is no longer safe. can someone explain to me what how exactly is the terrorist's phone encrypted? I'm here thinking because they can't get past the lock screen and icloud activation. Is that all? I bet this has already been made."
"This could be a cover up. Makes me wonder about Samsungs or any other phone company's stance on this. Does google embrace this as well with their products? I'd like to hear from them now.My next phone is an IPhone.I wonder if the backdoor can be also applied to android, or already has.I really dislike apple and their walled garden approach and policies. However this, this is right on the ball.Why doesn't Apple create a tool to get into the phone but not give it to law enforcement? You want to get into the phone, get a court order, bring us the phone, we'll do it for you. Problem solved? It's a burden on Apple, time, employees, etc.. so charge law enforcement $1,000 per device. Does anyone really think there should be no way to access the information on two mass murderer's phones? Both extremes are unnacceptable ie No one can access a locked phone or law enforcement has carte blanche to break into people's locked phones. Seems pretty simple to find an acceptable middle ground.>Why doesn't Apple create a tool to get into the phone but not give it to law enforcement?"
"The problem here is, where is this tool going to be stored? Is it just one computer/server inside a special room inside Apple HQ? Like it was said in the article, the fear is not so much the Government (though we know it is), but also the other people who may potentially get their hands on this.What if the tool leaks?What about people autside of USA ? Can they not just Patriot Act into it?damn, much respect to tim cook "
"I'm confused. Are the FBI trying to install a 'back door' which allows them to simply open the phone, or are they trying to get access to a program which would allow them to input a passcode infinetly without consequences?Never been an Apple fan but fair play to them for the stance they're taking. Wish more companies would do the sameHate the products. Despise iOS. iTunes is the worst piece of shit to ever contaminate a PC."
"Love the stance on encryption, howeverEveryone is so worried about what uncle sam can get off your iphone. chances are they already have it. I-phone might be encrypted, but once data leaves the phone, that data is open to anyone wanting to grab it. "
"The San Bernardino killers can't use their phone anymore, so that data is just sitting. Won't xmit. 10 failed login attempts and the phone resets, losing all data that could potentially help in the case or prevent more attacks. "
"Let's say some sicko kidnaps a shit ton of kiddies, stashes them all over, and stores that info on his i-phone. Gets into it with our boys in blue, and gets shot 20 times.....killer is down. What about those kids? You guys gonna scream 4th amendment then?"
"slippery slope argument can go a lot of different ways.As a practitioner of law, I got to say, attempting to use the All Writs Act of 1789 is a bold move Cotton.  I get uncomfortable when I have to rely on case law from the 1980's.I'm usually not a fan of apple but this is objectively a good thing for them to do.Hah, a US corporation is defending people's right to privacy. Meanwhile in the UK the government introduces surveillance laws and the public doesn't even blink an eye. Preach on, brother Tim.  Apple is not in the business of peddling personal data, nor should it be.Good on Tim Cook ... I am not a fan of Apple by any measure, but kudos to the company standing up for its customers/constituents - pity politicians don't have the balls to do the same thing!"
"(except for Bernie Sanders of course)Reddit in a nutshell right here.Congrats to apple for not giving in to the FBI; However, with all of the security flaws, in damn near every release of iOS, all the FBI has to do is wait around for some script kiddie to notice it, and brag about finding it, online. That'll give them a little more of a chance to gaining access to the device without apples help, and didn't do anything illegal because Apple released the iOS version that gave such access."
"I mean, when apple decides to release a patch, the FBI doesn't need to update the iOS until someone else brags about another security flaw they've found, and so on, and so forth. "
"Trying to get a shell program to access the data is just ridiculous though. Millions of Apple iOS users, not even just iPhones. Those without iPhones probably have an iTouch, or an iPad. "
"That expands their access to damn near everyone in the US and insane amounts overseas. All they would need to do is obtain your device for a short period of time and load Thor version of iOS and BAM, your info and everything you say/do is right in front of them. "
"Who knows, maybe they can even just do a fake Apple server and when people update, it's actually a phishing site to the FBI's version. Apple would be none the wiser and just think people wanted to jailbreak, or haven't updated yet. By then... It's too late. All your data is compromised, and so is Apples integrity. "
"Good on Apple for not being the governments bitch outside what is legally required. "
"Edit: their* version of iOS, not Thor. Although that sounds like a nice update name. I wonder if Steve left this on his will and why they're so adamant. Good job Apple. Steve hired Tim, presumably because he trusted him. No need to put anything in writing. Apple really pulled through for their end users this time. not yet. "
"This is just the start of pulling.>We oppose this order, which has implications far beyond the legal case at hand. "
"Sorry for being dumb. Does that mean that they did not give up yet, or they already gave it to FBI very and publicly reluctantly. Simply means they won't do itThey are refusing a court order. So the government can now decided to come in and force them at gun point arrest them all shut down apple attempt to sue them"
"But they won't because that would really step up the whole police state thing.Bravo Tim Cook! Bravo!I fully support Apple in this. If they compromise I wouldn't buy another iPhone. Law enforcement will have to do their job instead of relying on technology.You do realize that Apple are one of the strongest supporters of this, if Apple are forced to back down, then there aren't any other phone companies which would be safe.Pretty sure that was clear in the letter that they support it Wow, imposing The Writ Act which was written in 1789!? On 2016 tech? That's reaching a bit, to put it mildly. The FBI should ask China to help. I'm sure they already have a suitable backdoor enabled iOS version already they could lend out.When the government feels it is beyond the protocol of checks and balances..If the Apple team can create a new IOS that can unlock the data on an existing iPhone without destroying it, I wonder if a hacker team couldn't do the same.The FB fucking I can't get into the phone themselves??? And they expect me to believe this?  All they want is a back door device that they can use over and over. 10 failed attempts and the phone resets. They need to preserve the data within, not just break in.# The 4th Amendmemt"
"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things ..."
"Thank you Tim Cook for respecting the 4th Amendmemt.The problem here is that also becomes a Well....we tried letter when they are strong armed to do it anyway. I applaud Mr. Cook in this efforts, but does anyone seriously think  this ends well, without government overreach? I have a distaste for Apple products for reasons I won't discuss here but this response is exactly why I appreciate their existence. An open letter to the customer on such a controversial topic regardless of stance is a courageous and commendable move.As a loyal Android user and Apple hater I have to say I have nothing but respect for Mr. Cook.  While I'll never support Apple as a company I will support them on issues like this.  I hope Apple and Google can put their differences aside and work together to fight this, let's face it if any company gives in that sets a precedent and the rest will fall like domino's."
"Bravo Mr. Cook.Dear United States Government: Fuck off.And this is how it begins ..."
"They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety. - Benjamin Franklinlol this begun like 15 years ago bud.....good quote thoThis is insanity."
"As soon as Apple products have a legally mandated backdoor, everyone will stop buying them. "
"We're talking the death of the company here."
"Imagine a world where only American products had legally mandated backdoors.... "
"The lack of understanding it shows from the FBI is telling, too.... the people in charge are simply too old to be working there any more, they just do not get how information flows in the modern world."
"The 1960's world of shut the presses, arrest the journalists, squash all leaks is dead and gone. You CANNOT stop the spread of information in our world. Which means as soon as one hacker, criminal or terrorist has access to that backdoor, they all will within weeks...there is NO WAY to stop this. Ask Edward Snowden. Or DVD John."
"What needs to be done is, the heads of the FBI (Or whoever suggested this nonsense) need to be retired. They are dangerously old and outdated - what other stupid decisions are they making that actually endanger America rather than keep it secure?"
"I think this would be death for American IT products...goodbye to your server sales, phone sales, router sales....I honestly don't get the support for apple on this one......It's not about the shooters. It's about privacy generally. Once you build a back door into your house, anybody can walk in. Once you build a back door to your iPhone, anybody can hack it. Am I naive to say that if it means me being safe from the bad guys, I really don't give a care what the govt wants to do with my meaningless text messages.  Are you that scared that you're willing to part with every last shred of your privacy? I'm pretty sure that's how the FBI wants you to feel.I hate Apple, like down to my core, deep seated hatred. I have my reasons. But I must commend them on their stance on encryption and government overreach."
"I fear that the government would try to force this issue by using terrorism, much on the same way the Patriot Act was implemented, but they would never stop with just the San Bernardino case. No, if history and working for the government has taught me one thing it's that once the government has a resource then they will use that resource for their own twisted purposes."
"The NSA and other 3 letter groups keep talking about backdoors and that if we, the American people, are doing nothing wrong then it shouldn't be a problem. No, the problem is that the American people don't want the government having unfettered access to their personal lives - personal conversations - or other things. The problem is that these 3 letter organizations are making enemies out of each and every single American citizen."
"When did we become enemies of the state that they should need unlimited access to our personal data at any given time?Fuck the government. Eh, Apple are protecting their sales. They could help unlock the phone, they just don't want to.Although I don't like the idea of multinationals saying no to the government in a case that is obviously in everyone's best interest to solve, I am also against Big Brother creating secret privacy exceptions for itself alone. "
"I'm torn on this one."
"I hope the courts can sort it out.Its not that simple."
"The Police allowed the media access to the murder scene obliterating any forensic evidence there."
"This isn't about solving a case, this is about using this heavily reported emotionally fuelled situation to set a legal president, the defeat of encryption.Hang on a second. The fact that what the FBI is asking for is even possible in principle --- for Apple to write *software* that can be *installed* on the phone to facilitate its decryption --- means that the security of iPhone encryption is not actually resting on strong cryptography, or on the tamper-resistance of the secure coprocessor, a.k.a. [secure enclave](http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/10/why-cant-apple-decrypt-your-iphone.html). Instead, it's just security through obscurity. If Apple can write this software, then in principle someone else can write it by reverse engineering the stock firmware.From the letter they wrote Specifically, the FBI wants us to make a new version of the iPhone operating system, circumventing several important security features, and install it on an iPhone recovered during the investigation. In the wrong hands, this software -- which does not exist today -- would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone's physical possession.Apple is being asked to create a version of iOS that won't enforce passcode attempt limits and, ideally, will allow for electronic (rather than on-screen) passcode entry."
"Essentially government wants Apple to remove to OS-level protection against brute-force attacks.This is the iphone 5c that does not have hardware based security with the secure enclave. Thanks, you're right. Here's a source with the details: http://blog.trailofbits.com/2016/02/17/apple-can-comply-with-the-fbi-court-order/I don't understand why the fbi doesn't disassemble the phone to get to the memory it self and do a memory dump. Then they can brute force it all they want, and much faster than over the iPhone user interface The answer is one word: encryption. EVERYTHING in the iPhone is encrypted. Because the data is encrypted. So they could do that but you just end up with a senseless mess.I bet the government (NSA) already knows how to hack these phones but they are playing it off like they can't. To convince the world that smartphones are private and can't be hacked. So when Apple sells user information to government agencies for money without the knowledge of the user, it's very much ok, but when they are ordered by court to help solve a monstrous deadly case, it's not ok, and users must be protected. What a crock of s**t.Great statement. Now bring back manufacturing to the US and I'll buy an iPhone forever.Are you willing to pay $5000 for one though? hahaha at this rate, i hope Apple moves headquarters to somewhere else entirely. "
"If it makes you feel better most of the design and software engineering is done in the USTheir most high end, specialised and most powerful desktop is made in the US."
"Do you want expensive iPhones? Because that's how you get expensive iPhones.They already are expensive."
"Do you want American jobs? Because that's how you get American jobs.And they will be substantially more expensive if manufacturing is brought back to the US...The American Jobs guy was a massive asshole to his employees.It's not even just cost. The sheer _capacity_ does not exist. Apple already manufactures short-run products in the US, like the Mac Pro. You don't have the skills in the US unfortunately. "
"Edit. "
"http://m.theregister.co.uk/2015/12/21/apple_60_minutes_interview/I just read through all 50 responses.  100% of which support Apple plus a few questions mixed into it.   I don't see a single person supporting the investigators to find out what else is on the terrorists phone.  Maybe who funded it.  Maybe some leaders who are leading another terrorist cell.  The goal would be to prevent more deaths."
"I don't get why Reddit users are so passionate about back doors, encryption, and privacy.  "
"I've seen people worried about a big brother looking at all your stuff and a slippery slope that they could just look for any reason at all but unless you are a terrorist, why would they even care and what would they even do when they looked at your phone?   "
"To me, it seems like Reddit users, using the same logic, would also ban every form of wire tapping under all circumstances.   "
"I just don't get it as tens of thousands of murders, pedophiles, terrorists and such have been caught using these methods.  I don't see why this is so bad where privacy concerns are more important.   "
"Can someone give an example of why I should want terrorists to have encryption so that I can have my encryption?"
"Terrorists will still have encryption and you won't, you haven't thought about this much have you.I'm no security expert but if all terrorists will have encryption then why couldn't normal civilians who are so passionate about their own data just apply the same encryption? "
"Because once you put a back door in, anybody can use it for anything. Because if Apple is forced to make that back door, next time, what if it's not about terrorists? Or what if someone with nefarious purposes exploits the newly-added security flaw? Think of how much deeply personal information is on your phone. Don't say you have nothing to hide. You have plenty that the government and other individuals have no right to know."
"The government has no right to force Apple's hand by making them craft a security flaw that does not currently exist. Encryption is easy to do but hard to crack. Forcing companies to weaken and disable their encryption will make you open to hacking. Privacy is more than just your texts and photos. How often do you do your banking online? How often do you do your taxes? Submit resumes with private information? No encryption makes it SUPER easy for a hacker to just swoop in and pretend to be you, steal your identity and your money."
"Do you have a job? You probably have knowledge that would be useful to your employer's competitors. Hope you don't have anything that could be used to extort you. Businesses outside of the US won't want to work with us. Like, they simply won't trust anything made by the US and for good reason."
"Worst of all, the bad people will always have encryption. Always. It's just math."
">tens of thousands of murders, pedophiles, terrorists and such have been caught using these methods."
"Have a source on that?I'll bet most are members of facebook, and all the rest of social media."
"People themselves are their own worst enemies when it comes to privacy and security."
"Guys, help me out here. I'm struggling to find a way to hate on Apple for this.He's just trying to make himself look good for when they're finally forced to comply. It's smoke being blown directly up your asshole.What stops the government to write this code them selves without Apple knowing anything about it?Technically nothing. But it would be a very tedious process to rewrite big chunks of iOS from scratch. Not absolutely impossible (I guess you could hire some ex-programmers from Apple) but very expensive and time consuming to craft."
"I am also pretty sure it wouldn't be easy to do without some Apple internal keys - I somehow doubt you can flash iPhone with any firmware/software you want and it will work fine, it probably uses some checksums/keys. "
"Much easier (and actually legal whereas stealing Apple's keys and forcing former employees that have signed NDA to help you write a backdoor probably doesn't count as such) to ask the developer to do it for you. I don't normally say this, but *Daaaaamn!*, **respect!**Privacy aside, it would also be a massive blow to Apples sales if this was made public as people would desert in droves. Where would they go? Google and Microsoft are also American companies, vulnerable to the same issue. Excellent point - if one caves, then it's likely the others will follow, although being truly multi-national I'd suggest they would simply move offshore.I don't think most people realize just how damn important this is. This is nothing more than government mandated security vulnerabilities, and it should be called that explicitly to remind people just what the FBI is asking."
"This is a rare case of a company putting their butt on the chopping block to stand up for consumers, it's important that they're supported.Wow. Once this blows over, I'll go back to hating apple. For now, rock on! Dear US Government. Go. Fuck. Yourself. Signed, Suspicious Person 389.You are guaranteed protection from illegal search and seizure.  Once warrants are granted and there is an investigation, you have no more protection.  Never in our history has there been anything that was protected from search when court ordered.  I am an advocate of privacy, but that all happens before the fact.  Once you are being officially investigated, the authorities have every right to search your things.  What you are all arguing is not preserving privacy, it is creating a new class of never searchable no matter what documents.  This has never existed.Which one? The two found dead? What about the three, tall and athletic shooters reported initially?The fbi wanted a back door on a potential suspects phone? Like, a bug? Is that it? Why wouldn't he do this? Confused. I guess I'm one of the only people seeing this as a business strategy. I think it was a damn smart move by Tim. Make that shit public and let everyone know.Proud iPhone users here. Always have been and always will be."
"Thanks Tim for standing up for what's right So let me get this straight, it's okay for society to give cops guns and allow them to shoot people so long as the cops actions fall with-in the rules, but we draw the line when it comes to giving the cops Muhammed's iphone contact list.  Nice soapbox reddit, but this makes no sense.  Decrypt that phone if you have a warrant.This isn't just any old search and seizure warrant. The FBI wants Apple to make its customers' data less secure generally. It's a terrorism investigation now, but what's it going to be tomorrow?Go Timmy, dude's got balls, gay balls, but balls nonetheless.>FBIs intentions are good."
"I didn't realize he was writing a comedy piece.Is this the exact moment in history where corporations assume more power than governments? Definitely not.I'm always very skeptical of Apple, and only after reading the entire thing I realised they're actually kinda right, but they do make it all seem a little too dramatic:"
"> The FBI wants us to make a new version of the Potato operating system, circumventing several important security features, and install it on a Potato recovered during the investigation. In the wrong hands, this software -- which does not exist today -- would have the potential to unlock any Potato in someone's physical possession."
"The FBI may use different words to describe this tool, but make no mistake: Building a version of potatOS that bypasses security in this way would undeniably create a backdoor. And while the government may argue that its use would be limited to this case, there is no way to guarantee such control.This is not too dramatic, it is a big issueA month later: Tim Cook has been found guilty of tax evasion and has been sentenced to X years in prison."
"You don't fuck with the US government openly, and Tim Cook has made the biggest mistake of his life.FBI shouldn't have been so eager to be heroes and kill the terrorists.  There are very good reasons for keeping criminals alive, they wouldn't have all these problems now if the shooters were alive.How do you suggest the FBI apprehend people who are actively shooting at them? I've always wanted to see advancements in long range tranquilizers that would subdue vs kill in order to help with safe quelling of an active threat.I think that would be phenomenal technology if we could apply it in the field. Unfortunately I don't see us being anywhere having a testable product mostly because a lot of bad people are arming themselves more heavily and weapons are extremely accessible in the US. In Florida for example you can go to a gun show and purchase a firearm with just an ID from a private seller. Scary people frequent these places.Companies only care about money. They try to fool you that they care about your privacy but they don't. They try to appear as freedom fighters by telling the public that they refuse to be vassals to the governments in order to make the public trust them even more and keep buying their products. IT IS ONLY ABOUT MONEY.You're right, but in this case, it's best for them to do them right thing, as it solidifies customer trust. Congrats, Apple! Every wanna be terrorist will be buying iphones from here on out.[deleted]This...As a company selling a product. I would tell you that there is no backdoor until you prove there is and still I'll deny it. I pander to the lowest denominator who knows nothing about technology. If I were to say that we have established a backdoor. Sales would hit rock bottom. I want to believe but seriously, do we think our government would allow a device with full inaccessible privacy on the market? How realistic does that sound in today's world. Tim is doing exactly what a business man would do, protect your cash cow.Existed*"
"Removing the delay and 10 failure wipe was addressed in A7+ phones."
"The 5C does not have the security enclave.The disturbing thing to me though is that the answer is not: we can't, but we won't. If the data on that phone was properly encrypted only the first answer could be right. "
"I respect mr Cook's gesture but from a security point of view it implies something's terribly wrong. He's in a position of great power, because millions of people will immediately and vehemently defend his stance without knowing a thing about it. They would do the same if he had acquiesced. The RDF is now affecting politics!WTF does the FBI think is on this phone that is SOO important?"
">Data that would be encrypted on the device includes contacts, photos and iMessages. Having access to that material could shed light on why the couple picked the target they did, whether they were planning other attacks"
"Irrelevant, they are dead."
">and whether they received any direction or support from overseas."
"If you can't access it from the phone you will have to rely on other measures. If there's no information that you can find to answer the question, then you have to move on. Its not worth the cost, the effort, the risk to find the answer to this question."
">FBI Supervisory Special Agent Christopher Pluhar said the public interest in this case supports the government getting access to the data. "
"Not according to the public. I see no additional benefit to this. The only reasonable idea is that either a. They coordinated with others who are as of yet undetected or b. They were in contact with someone overseas who they previously did not know. In that case, the intelligence value of that information is minimal, and chances are that the person would be revealed through other means eventually. The inability to get this information is unlikely to have an immediate, negative effect.The guy is dead and guilty. What additional evidence will you obtain? If you really want it hire a hacker. I doubt the encryption is so good a professional hacker couldn't bypass it. Heck do they need to even decrypt it? Can't they just bypass the login and observe the content it's native system? Wait, so if they can make a iOS that unlocked previously encrypted content... doesn't it mean that there ALREADY a backdoor, they just decide not to give it? They can't decrypt the data. Have you even read the articles?I'm somewhere in between agreeing or disagreeing if you are to view Apple's position like a landlord who won't allow police access to the property of a convicted killer. "
"And maybe I'm old fashioned but I don't think smartphones have become an essential part of our lives just yet."
"And as for storing our private conversations, where we have been and where we are going. I'm not sure all of us do that by conscious choice. Better comparison would be: Apple being a landlord. Police asking them to build in a door without a lock, for everyone to use. Because that's basically what's going to end up happening, if this were to go through. Might be the wrong sub for this discussion, but how is this even possible?  If all the data on the phone is encrypted then how would anything short of the users key or a brute force decryption work to expose the data.  It doesnt sound to me like Apple is actually encrypting the data, merely hiding it in a locked folder of the OS.It is encrypted. As far as I understand, the FBI wants a version of the OS that will make a brute force possible, because currently it isn't.Apple should comply with the court order and assist the FBI in investigating the mass murder hopefully in doing so Apple will help prevent more people from being murdered by these barbarians. I think you missed the point completely....oh heavens to betsy !!! Not the dreaded elipses.  Apple should comply with the Court's Order.  Hey Apple - instead of just trying to sell us the iPad 3 or the watch - how about helping law enforcement to prevent more people from being murdered by jihadists/barbarians?  It's not just about San BernardinoCan someone explain to me how decrypting one phone is a threat to everyone? "
"Say, on UNIX, if I die, root or systems, could read all my files without breaking the encryption of logging in. "
"If I had password protected encrypted files, nobody will be able to decrypt them, unless there is a backdoor in decryption (master key) that allows to decrypt all files without any knowledge of user-specific password."
"Now if Apple security is like the latter, then Apple already has the master key. Giving it to FBI, despite all the nasty things people say about the government is just increasing the circle of knowledge of people who have the master key (EDIT: after rereading, I see the initial mistake: once law enforcement knows the master key, it will just start breaking all phones: I am still presuming here that my assumption is correct)"
"There is also a simpler solution which would involve somebody from Apple with a knowledge of master key coming down to an FBI station and decrypting the phone without giving up the master key."
"Sorry for posting a lot of assumptions being a complete newb in Apple securityIt is a threat as right now FBI has a big issue when decrypting phones - 10 attempts and data on it gets wiped out. On top of that it's a boring and annoying process as you need to manually tap each combination. "
"What FBI wants is a special version of iOS that won't delete any files and will make testing all possible key combinations easier. AFAIK there is no master key to iPhones yet but if all that protects your phone is a 4-digit PIN then breaking it is not tremendously hard either (like 10000 combinations?). "
"I guess a natural step up of requiring no less than 6 **characters** (with ability to use more) would make this a much smaller issue. Nevertheless however - setting a scenario like this customized OS is already a dangerous thing happening. As sooner or later this thing will leak out to public (and it will already exist so governments have a much easier way of reusing it rather than try and force Apple to craft something specifically). Meaning that if you used default iPhone settings you would be vulnerable. AIUI they're not asking Apple to hand over a master key (which Apple do not have).  Nor they are asking them to directly decrypt the phone (which Apple cannot do)."
"What the FBI want to do is bruteforce the password to the phone.  They can't do this because of a 10 strikes and you're out feature - if you give an iPhone 10 bad passwords in a row it wipes itself.  "
"The order tells Apple to produce a tool which can be loaded on the subject phone and will disable or bypass this feature, and also facilitate brute-forcing of the password by allowing the guesses to be supplied via some form of cable or wireless connection."
"The concern is that once such a tool exists it can be leaked (either from within Apple or the FBI).Why dont they just create the software but require the FBI go to them on a case by case basis to unlock the phones?"
"Apple retain control of the dodgy software and the FBI can get access to terrorist data.Why don't they just decrypts the data? Like, take all the information off the phone and make it available? They can't, because it's encrypted and they don't have the key either.Tim cook is an operations manager with no deep understanding of encryption, its someone in his staff but filed under his name.[deleted]It always helps to read the article.No, there isn't currently a backdoor, but rather the FBI want Apple to create a custom version of iOS which would act as a backdoor for the purpose of decrypting the iPhone in question:"
"> But now the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone.Specifically in the letter:"

"and"
">  In the wrong hands, this software -- **which does not exist today** -- would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone's physical possession."
"The court order is essentially trying to force Apple to create a backdoor, not that one exists now.Shower thought/conspiracy:"
"What if this is all a publicity stunt to trick criminals into believing iPhones are protected by Apple from the government. It's all a ploy to get more criminals to use iPhones. They are trying to make criminals feel safe and secure enough to use iPhones when Apple is actually allowing government agencies to spy on them all."
"OR"
"Apple is actually being truthful and standing up to the ever intrusive nose of the government and sticking it to the long arm of the law.[deleted]> probably **only** concerned with his company."
"I'm sure he's concerned about his company, but that doesn't preclude the possibility that he also *personally* cares about privacy. Given his life experiences, I think it's very likely that in addition to being a smart business move, this comes in part from his personal beliefs.His job, and technically the only headlines that should include CEO, are supposed to be only about his company.Right because Apple isn't already SELLING your private information to third parties."
"-sent from my iPhoneUh, it isn't. They don't need to. You should read [this](http://www.apple.com/privacy/)"
"Our business model is very straightforward: We sell great products. **We don't build a profile based on your email content or web browsing habits to sell to advertisers. We don't monetize the information you store on your iPhone or in iCloud. And we don't read your email or your messages to get information to market to you**. "
"One very small part of our business does serve advertisers, and that's iAd. We built an advertising network because some app developers depend on that business model, and we want to support them as well as a free iTunes Radio service. iAd sticks to the same privacy policy that applies to every other Apple product. It **doesn't get data from Health and HomeKit, Maps, Siri, iMessage, your call history, or any iCloud service like Contacts or Mail, and you can always just opt out altogether.**That's selling meta data, and you might not like it but it's not the same as selling personal data."
"You also agree to that when you click that little terms and conditions button, I suggest you try reading them before bitching about it in the future.You get what you pay for, in this case security."
"It's pretty clear to all where they get their income from."
"If you aren't paying for something, you are the product.There has got to be a way to get the data without giving encryption backdoor.  Why doesn't the FBI just give Apple the phone and then they will extract the data themselves. "
"Simple.The only way is to get the owner to unlock the phone.They can't.  It's encrypted, that's the point.Well let Apple retrieve the Data and give it to the government.They can't.  It's encrypted, that's the point.They can't retrieve the data. It's encrypted. What are you not getting here?"
"This whole issue is not about reversing the encryption but facilitating brute forcing.What I don't get is Why doesn't Apple have a way to get the data without giving the government access to future phones.  Can't they just access it themselves and turn over the data?>  Can't they just access it themselves and turn over the data?"
"For the third time: no. Because it's encrypted. Not sure how to word this better for you.So why couldn't this just be a one time case to access data.  Yes it's encrypted, and Apple has the ability to retrieve it, why can't they retreive it, give it to the government, and then carry on?  Why does this supposedly give government future access to common peoples phones.  What is to make us believe Apple isn't already doing what we fear the government is?> Yes it's encrypted, and Apple has the ability to retrieve it"
"How is this not clear to you yet? They cannot magically decrypt stuff for which they don't have the key. All they can do is facilitate a brute force by removing the 10 try limit failsafe, specific to the phone model.Then what is the court battle over?  If Apple can't access the data then what does the government want?"
"Why does the case of this one phone set future precedent for all phones?  I don't get it.Sigh..."
"By forcing them to bypass the 10 fail auto wipe mechanism, they are taking steps to weaken security measures meant for the people at large. On principle, this is not acceptable, especially for one case.Surprisingly I'm okay with what the FBI is asking. Apple should just unlock the phone for them by doing what they suggested in house and then give them the phone back with the passcode."
"If Apple can be trusted to keep the operating system code safe, they should be able to keep the hacked operating system code safe. Apple would only have to respond to one-off requests for phone unlockings, which they should only honor in the most extreme circumstances.ISIS and every other terrorist organization has just place an order with Apple for thousands of iPhones, they are upgrading for security reasons. I can hear the sound of the cash registers at Apple stores, chichinnnn!!!!"
"encryption is the least of our intelligence problems with terrorist organizations, considering they pretty much all use throwaway phones that cost like 10$"
"they don't fear our de-encryption, they fear the Hellfire drone strikesAm I right to believe that if this was implemented: the FBI could use it on anyone?"
"I was just surprised at people's reaction. The guy is a killer, surely he has lost all of his rights."
"There is no doubt that the guy is a killer and has lost all his rights. But you have to understand what would of happened the moment Apple complied."
"**....and now the FBI have all my dick photos.**"
"*dammit, it seems the FBI lied...*"
"No matter what your view on the government is, you know that they're going to abuse anything and everything. If they were able to access iOS devices do you really think they would stop at device number one? I believe Apple passed over a billion devices sold last year. The US government will abuse that backdoor until there is a data center the size of Texas.Maybe he's just pretending to be opposed to it while secretly cooperating.tldr version  plsssss, at work no time.. >Smartphones, led by iPhone"

I bet they have given them EVERYTHING they wanted, and are now just going out saying they refuse so when the case informs about having this secured information then to the public it will look like Apple didn't do it, but the Government has broken in.How does text on screen have an odor?

"Apple Faces $5 Million Lawsuit Over Allegedly Slowing the iPhone 4S With iOS 9LOL $5M?   They might as well ask for an office chair.Yup, and the only people who are really going to make any money here are the lawyers. Those court fees are doing to add up quick Principles matter. If you had $20, this is like someone asking for half a cent. Think about that for a moment.It's unlikely for them to be given more in court, since it's a 5 year old device and there's almost no grounds for the suit, it's easier to ask for less and settle out of court."
"They might get some money, but the consequence will be terrible for most consumers-- Apple will simply stop releasing updates for 5-year-old devices, like you currently see for most android manufacturers. Are you kiddin? 5 years is not a long time. Just because they release a new one every year and want you to buy it, doesn't mean they have the right to ruin your products. 5 years in the mobile world is a lifetime. My Motorola stopped getting updates in one year.Ok,but as an object, especially ones that are sold as'state of the art' 5 years is not a long time. Each phone is an extremely powerful little computer, that you have the right to use as long as you want (or at least until you deem it too old for your needs). Not getting updates is ok. But forcing someone to get an update that will ruin the experience of using the phone is completely different.> 5 years in the mobile world is a lifetime."
"Only because you believe the marketing. Looking at the past 5 years I'd say it's more than advertising. It's only until recently that the performance almost doubled for each new gen. "
"A galaxy 2/3 is still usable but the performance is nowhere near current gen and it's really noticeable. Consequences will never be the same. I was thinking the exact same thing. When they release iOS10 the performance of the 5s will probably tank but its outdated technology so its to be expected. I understand being thrifty and wanting to save money by not upgrading your equipment, but don't expect it to continue to work well or be supported after new models are released every year. OR Apple should be legally responsible for software patches of exploits on devices they sell, but should be legally prevented from forcing os upgrades."
"If I buy a PC and Microsoft stops supporting windows I can upgrade or move to Linux.  My iPhone is locked down, and that business decision should have consequences for Apple."
"They are selling time bombs that otherwise could easily last plenty of people 6+ years.Most people don't use their phones for 6 years though. Most people only use their phone for 2 years. And why is that?Maybe it's a more British thing, but here most people have their phone on contract. A decent contract is about $30-50 a month for two years, and the phone doesn't cost anything. So most people get a more up to date phone at the end of their contract. OK, how about iPads and iPod touches then?Most people upgrade their tablets quite regularly anyway. As for touches, I don't have an answer. Though this suit is about iPhone so I'm not sure those are relevant. Doesn't matter.  If I pay a thousand dollars for a phone I should be able to use it because I paid for it.  Apple shouldn't be remotely bricking them.and android handset makers...don't? I am sorry but you don't understand how support *actually* works. Additionally, if you read the EULA agreement all that is laid out for you *clearly*; should you disagree, then return the phone for a refund.Android phones should be supported or unlocked too."
"If a company decides to stop releasing updates they should be required to disable forced signing.No, that would create more security problems... in any-case Apple is really generous supporting its devices for far longer than most Android handset makers do... but again, as I said it's all written down to EULA, if you don't agree with that -- it's fine, but don't use it.Since the eula would never hold up in court, and they know that, they won't ever risk testing it."
"They might be better than android but desktop windows has a decade of security updates."
"Letting me turn off secure boot to install my os isn't a security problem and I think it's a joke that you feel that way.  It's way worse to leave the OS broken by jailbreaks.Well I think it will just end up like the class action they recently had for the 16GB storage space on ios 8. These are troll suits... it's a free market, if you don't like it you can opt for something else.They change the rules after you make the purchaseWhen has anyone ever been forced to update the OS?iOS updates are strongly recommended by Apple, and they nag you every day to do it."
"You can't downgrade."
"You must upgrade, to get security patches.You don't have an option to downgrade.Downgrades are disabled.  Once you do it you can't go back.  That's force."
"How would you know it ruins the experience without trying.My original iPad is basically a paperweight. "
"Sucks, but what can you do? That is a good thing stop acting like apple is somehow helping people by releasing updates that break the phone.  It worked before and now it doesn't,  don't update the damn phone if it can't handle it.  Please apple, stop updating old phones. Or just let people downgrade. Then they can choose.> They might get some money, but the consequence will be terrible for most consumers-- Apple will simply stop releasing updates for 5-year-old devices"
"will it be terrible? maybe it's not such a bad ideaNo it won't be terrible, their updates are what makes those devices unusableIt will be **terrible** from a technical perspective. Outdated communication protocols, bugs, exploits, etc. We'll end up with something like Windows XP.I've got an iphone 5 still hanging around the house, used to watch some netflix, play some games and the likes. Still in ios 6.something. Works fine, I won't change anything."
"Well, some apps are unusable since they require a newer ios, but.. better to have a working device.I've been feeling the same way ever since the iOS 9 update, and I'm on an iPhone 6+. I think it's bullshit that a phone I bought only a year ago feels this sluggish. It took them months to fix the lag when switching between apps, and even now it's still not nearly as smooth of a process as before.I didn't update. But it still pisses me off that a company purposely does this. Makes me wonder about my android. It got slow as hell after the updates and filled up all available memory, even after I deleted a ton of stuff, I still can't download any apps to it or update my current apps.They don't purposely [do] this. The lawsuit is completely baseless; there is no way in hell that Apple is deliberately slowing down older devices."
"Every time Apple drops support for an old device, people complain and accuse Apple of being greedy because surely the new OS would run just fine on their device if Apple didn't prohibit it. And every time they release an OS update that _doesn't_ drop device support, people accuse Apple of deliberately slowing down older devices. I'm pretty sure there have been class-action lawsuits about this before that never went anywhere.My iPhone 4s is without the update and is still very fast, faster than the people who updated theirs. And in the case of the new update, they immediately saw slow down. Apple is full of shit.Practically every major consumer OS update in the history of computing has caused older devices to slow down\*. Apple always has to make a choice between bad PR for dropping older devices because they're clearly just being greedy and bad PR for older devices not running as well. I'm pretty sure people have even tried to sue Apple over dropping device support before because they think just like you, that Apple is intentionally punishing owners of old devices, which is complete bullshit. Hell, the iPhone 4 is old enough you should be happy that it can run iOS 8, much less iOS 9. It has _always_ been true that when you own one of the oldest devices supported by a major OS update, you need to figure out if the new OS features are worth the almost guaranteed performance drop. The fact that you expect to be able to update to the latest OS without any consequences for your 5.5-year-old device is pretty shocking."
"^(*Apple even went so far as to dedicate two separate major OS updates to OS X towards tuning the OS instead of adding features. It's also worth mentioning that this effect is less pronounced in desktop/laptop OS's these days because the hardware performance isn't increasing so dramatically each year anymore, which means that an OS that performs well on modern hardware is more likely to perform well a several-year-old hardware too. But in any market where hardware performance increases significantly each year, such as in the mobile market, the effect is very strong. You just don't hear about it so much with Android because it's rare that a several-years-old Android phone is even allowed to upgrade to the latest OS; often Android phones are no longer supported after less than a year!)"
"**Edit:** Wait a sec, [Wikipedia says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_9) that the oldest iPhone supported by iOS 9 is the iPhone 4S, not the iPhone 4. Which one do you have? Although the 4S is still over 4 years old.Maybe Apple could continue to support its older OSs then?  And offer essential security patches for them?  Like on Microsoft Windows?Apple has in the past offered security updates for the previous major OS (typically just for really major issues). But they don't offer the same sort of long-tail maintenance that Microsoft does for 3 reasons:"
"1. Windows is used in a lot of situations where it's impossible to update. This covers just generic corporate use where IT requires a certain version, as well as a lot of embedded use (even things like ATMs!) where it simply can't be updated because the system it's supporting is only built for that particular version of Windows. Business use like this is a major focus for Microsoft, and so they need to support it. This means offering security patches for old OS's for a very long time. People end up using the same major version of Windows for over a decade, even! Which just doesn't happen with OS X."
"2. Windows had a fundamental security issue to begin with. Microsoft had to institute a very aggressive security patch policy (remember Patch Tuesdays?) to combat this. Apple's OS's have not had that problem (for a variety of reasons, pick whichever one you like). Sure, OS X and iOS do have security issues, but it's a night-and-day difference. OS X security updates happen maybe 2-3 times a year and they include maybe a dozen issues. And because iOS's fundamental architecture is built to be secure from the get-go (unless you jailbreak, which by definition is disabling the security policy built into the OS) there ends up being very few major security issues to begin with. In fact, nearly all of the security issues that are found in iOS are done so by people attempting to find a way to jailbreak the latest version. Granted, they're still important issues that need fixing, but they're rare enough these days that it typically takes many months of work by a team of people to find a single one."
"3. Apple switched to free OS updates. IIRC iOS updates have always been free, and OS X updates went free many years ago. With the free OS updates, this means that anyone can take advantage of security updates in the latest OS by upgrading, as long as their device is still supported. I suspect this is actually the biggest reason why Apple errs on the side of keeping compatibility with old devices even when performance suffers. If you do have a really old device and you want to update to the latest major OS, the general advice is don't do it until other people have reported how it runs on that device, and even then, you probably want to hold off until a few minor updates have come out (if the new OS runs particularly bad on old devices, minor updates sometimes improve things, although that depends on why it runs so poorly and how many people are actually affected)."
"Besides all that, there's also just the rather simplistic answer that Microsoft has a lot more engineers than Apple does. Microsoft has over 50k engineers ([source](http://news.microsoft.com/facts-about-microsoft/#EmploymentInfo)), which represents just under half of their employees. I can't find an actual breakdown for Apple, but in their [latest 10-K filing](http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AAPL/931257034x0x857225/7D58F9C1-092A-42FC-8C55-4E8B647E5FE9/2015_Form_10-K_As-filed_.pdf) they report 110k full-time equivalent employees, and in their [2014 annual report](http://investor.apple.com/secfiling.cfm?filingid=1193125-14-383437) their retail employees accounted for 49.8% of their full-time equivalent employees. Assuming the same percentage today, that means they have around 55k non-retail full-time equivalent employees. I have no idea how many of these are engineers, but it should be obvious already that Apple's engineer count is a lot lower than Microsoft.Sorry, the iPhone 4S. I left out a letter.Honestly, I was surprised that the iPhone 4S even supported iOS 8 (same with iPod Touch 5th generation, as that's the same hardware). Speaking as an iOS developer, having to support the iPhone 4S really sucks when building any kind of resource-intensive app (apps that need a lot of RAM, or CPU/GPU performance). Heck, the iPhone 4S is also the only device supported by iOS 8 that still has a 3.5-inch screen (even the iPod Touch 5th generation has a 4-inch screen despite being the same SOC).My only real problem is when they allow an OS update that supports an old phone and limit the new features to the newer ones when it's guaranteed to not be a problem. "
"And example is the 3gs, I had one and they released the update with Siri and new text tones and such before they let you use custom ones. Siri was understandably locked down because the 3gs can't run it. The new text tones and ring tones being restricted on the other hand was completely bullshit and there's no way it was a technical limitation. > they released the update with Siri and new text tones and such before they let you use custom ones."
"I'm confused. Siri was released with the iPhone 4S, which was released with iOS 5. Searching the web right now indicates that iOS 5 added the ability to create custom text tones, so I don't know what you mean by before they let you use custom ones."
"> The new text tones and ring tones being restricted on the other hand was completely bullshit and there's no way it was a technical limitation."
"I can think of three reasons why the iPhone 3GS might be stuck with the original set of text tones in iOS 5 (I'm assuming here that you couldn't add custom text tones either on the 3GS?):"
"1. Maybe it *is* a technical limitation. My recollection is the original text/ringtones were all really short, but the ones they added later were often long. Maybe they had to rewrite part of the phone/message system to support longer text tones, but this new version didn't run properly on the 3GS? (spitballing as to why: maybe they keep the selected ringtone/text tone cached in the audio subsystem all the time to ensure there's zero delay in playing it, and supporting this for longer text tones might have required a change in the audio hardware to avoid impacting the use of audio in the rest of the OS; or maybe something else entirely)"
"2. The iPhone 3GS only had 256MB of RAM. The iPhone 4 had 512MB. They may have left out features (such as long text tones) because it would cause the OS to reserve too much of the RAM for itself, which would break applications that had particularly high RAM requirements."
"3. Maybe they had to slim down the OS partition size on the 3GS. If the OS for the 3GS was bigger than the OS for other devices (e.g. because of having to include things in the OS for compatibility reasons that simply isn't needed in the OS) then they might have to make up for that space elsewhere (because increasing the OS partition size decreases the available space for user applications/data, which isn't good). Ditching resource files that they don't actually need (e.g. the new long text tones) is an easy way to recover some space."
"I suspect the answer lies close to #1 or #2 (#3 seems a little unlikely to me because I'm not sure what they'd have to include that would take up more space). Granted, you could be right and it could have just been a marketing decision to arbitrarily restrict some features to a new device, but that also seems unlikely because it just doesn't make much sense (nobody is going to update their device just to get a newer text tone, and Apple doesn't have a history of limiting features to newer hardware without some technical reason).I do agree with you, but Apple should just allow downgrading if people don't like their new OS, or it runs too slow."
"That way you can downgrade if you're unhappy instead of just being screwed.Usually in the past if you put a new version of Windows on a 5 year old computer it would slow down too. It's not because Microsoft *wants* to slow down your computer, it's because more features require more cpu cycles."
"But, at least with Windows you can go back and install an old version if the new one slows you down. That's Apple's real failure here, not letting people go back to an old version. "
"Until then they're screwed either way... when they cut out an old device from updates people accuse them of not supporting their hardware, and when they do support an old device people accuse them of slowing down their phone."
"The point is, apple is not *trying* to slow down your phone... they're trying to add more features and they have to balance how old a device they're willing to support given the heat they'll take on both sides of that line.If Apple is so smart, then why push an update that they know their older tech will not be able to handle? Either their programmers are idiots/forgetful who only think the newest tech exists, or they do it on purpose to push newer product consumerism.It's not that the devices can't handle it, it's that there is a tradeoff between getting the newer features and having the device run slower. Some people want the newer features even if it's slower than the day they bought it 5 years ago; some people would rather keep it snappy and forget about the newer features. They're never going to please everyone no matter what they do so they have to try and balance it down the middle. It's not like they make the devices unusable.Maybe Apple could continue to support its older OSs then?  And offer essential security patches for them?  Like on Microsoft Windows?At least Android is typically easy to root and modify. You can even install custom roms in it easily.Not anymore if you want to use any kind of mobile payment system. You root your phone and you lose access for your own safety You mean those wireless credit card programs? I don't use those at all anyways.I can't speak for speed, but your ram should always be nearly fully used. It serves no purpose to sit around empty. Empty ram is wasted ram. sounds like he's talking about storage spaceI disagree, but also.... Agree..... There should be enough ram to run the base OS with significant headroom for application usage. Ram should never be fully utilized. Paging to disk is NOT good.... Once you page to disk you have lost the battle."
"(Note I live in a PC world and android OS)when I have to update any android device, I just double check that everything is backed up and do a factory reset. Doing that solves all the problems you've listed. Plus regularly making sure everything is on auto backup is great for if your phone breaks, gets stolen, lost -- You know you haven't lost any data.My nexus 7 2013 just got android 6.0 and it's like it's fresh out of the box. I was considering replacing it but it runs so much better after this update that I don't need to.Nexus line devices are the latest AOSP android + the latest signed GAPPS package and nothing else. 3rd party manufacturers spend months getting the latest base builds working with their crappy overlays, launchers and 3rd party dialers and other crap that doesn't need to be there and doesn't work as well as AOSP."
"This is usually why most devices suffer from updates, except Nexus or Play edition devices.What phone do you have? Saying my Android is like saying my car since there are tons of different companies that make phones using their own versions of Android. Samsung, for instance, has a reputation for their phones slowing down immensely through time while Google's tend to stay snappy and fast for years and years.[My android] (http://i.imgur.com/JxNRA5w.jpg)An android is actually a type of automaton, so he's talking about his artificial butler."
"Android (capital A) is also an operating system built on top of Linux, and you can't have an Android just like you can't have a Facebook (unless you're called Mark Zuckerberg and are already working on a second system called Facebook)."
"You can have an Android-based device and a Facebook account."
"Random rant over.It's an LG MS500 android 4.1.2 Root, backup apps, reflash new a 3rd Party ROM, flash kernel with over clock, buy extended life battery for $6 on eBay. Will run like a newer phone for twice as long as before and have 3 times the free space. That phone is like the $100 laptop at Walmart that can boot to a desktop but anything else is probably too much to ask.  A device is going to be a cheap device.  I got it two years ago. I have less apps on it than when I started using it, but now for some unknown reason, it won't let me download any new apps due to insufficient storage which makes no sense.If that's the case, your only option is to perform a factory reset on it. "
"I had a galaxy nexus just decide it wasn't going to boot one day and I had to go back to square one with it. Woah, just looked that up on eBay and they're 20 bucks. I love LG though, their Nexus 5 is my favorite phone ever and I currently use their G4, a fantastic device. Nexus 5 is 3 years old and still runs like it's brand new.I'm using an LG nexus 4 on 6.0 and its still snappy.LG G2 on 5.1.1 or whatever. snappy.I'm _still_ using the first Nexus 5, got it replaced through my insurance for a failing battery, probably keeping it till I can afford the new nexus 5.In all honesty, the LG Optimus line was never a beefy specced series, although it shouldn't be struggling with Jellybean. Have you attempted a factory reset?I've just uninstalled the updates for the memory heavy apps, like chrome. It seems to run better that way. Unfortunately it still says I can't download any apps. I don't have that many to begin with, just the basic ones. But even after deleting apps, removing updates, cleaning up the system, I still can't download any apps because it says insufficient storage. It really boggles my mind why this would be, if I made room for it in the first place.Try a restart or close and reopen the play store. Sometimes, there's some time lag for the Play Store to detect a change in available storage. Outside of that, I'm not sure what would work.I actually know what that is your phone tried to download something but it couldn't so it left an error message that it sees every time you try to download something even after you cleared space."
"Try this link to help"
"http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/how-to/google-android/how-fix-androids-insufficient-storage-available-error-message-3623467/Yes which android? Personally my Samsung phones have been perfectly fine for years and I have no complaints. I'm not surprised about apple slowing down devices, they have been trying to make them incompatible with *everything* for years. I've actually updated an apple device and it's become incompatible afterwards!My nexus 7 (2012) got so bad after 5.0 that I can't use it anymore. My Nexus 5  was still fast even after the 6.0 update. I don't see why some devices can turn to crap while others get better with time.  "
"Anyway, Google and Apple doesn't have THAT many devices to quality check, but yet they seem to fail miserably at it.The 2012 nexus 7  has an hardware issue with its memory slowing it down alsoThe 2012 Nexus 7 had a physical defect in the type of NAND flash (storage) that it used which caused it to degrade much more quickly than it should have done. It was a hardware problem rather than a software problem in that case. The Nexus 5, and new Nexus 7 use different storage and remain speedy for this reason."
"Edit: there's a type of file system that you can use which apparently helps the Nexus 7 problem, but it requires using a custom ROM etc. It also has some disadvantages, I think it's less stable? Don't quote me on that.The older Nexus 7 had an issue with  slowing down with that update. You can clear the cache out and it should become more responsive iirc. "
"Still not as fast as my 2013 Nexus 7, but it's a noticeable change. Like I told OP, just make sure your phone is backed up and do a factory reset when it's time to do a major software update. I had my Galaxy S2 for almost 4 years and it was always snappy.The part that makes it really seem intentionally malicious is that they don't you any sort of window to roll back after an update. I turned off Siri suggestions in settings and my lab is gone :DThanks for the tip! Just turned it off. Let's see how it goes.Same here, and I can't think of single feature in iOS9 that I've given a shit about. My 6+ was impressively snappy when I bought it (especially coming from an original Galaxy Note), but now it feels like I'm always waiting for it to catch up. There was a time I would get excited about OS upgrades, now I'm starting to dread them.App support is the feature you really like. "
"If you stay behind in iOS updates, then you lose support from new app developers who are likely only working with the latest APIs and features. Over time you will stop receiving updates for your older apps, as those developers too have moved to working with newer APIs that your iOS version doesn't support. "
"It's understandable to be upset about iOS being sluggish on older device lines, but everyone seems to forget the app ecosystem being such a big part of it. [deleted]So what are you turning to when your Android phone becomes obsolete with time?by blow you mean the nose candy the lawyers are going to vacuum up after the lawsuit?They didn't make it obsolete. Software advances. Hardware needs to advance with it. The user experience of a 4S running IOS 9 would tarnish the image of iPhones as a whole.And you think that other manufacturers don't do the same? You are in for a big surprise. Funny I had the opposite experience.  My HTC Droid Incredible 2 turned into an incredibly slow POS in seemingly 1.5 years or so.  2 years at best.  I bought my third smart phone, an iPhone 6S Plus in December, after using Androids for 5 years partly because I noticed older iPhones still worked great.  Is the 4S finally getting slow?  Well damn, it's 4 years old.  My girlfriend's iPhone 5 (same age as the Incredible POS 2) still works great, though the camera is showing its age.Yeah good luck with that[deleted]I meant that people won't care . if people wanted performance and speed they would have dropped apple long ago. It's a name that's all it is, the speed of their shit 4 years ago is the same as it is today. This makes it public, /r/technology subscribers probably already know this but for the average consumer the news headline apple loses court battle for slowing devices with new OS hurts, these are people who probably want to keep their device for over 2 years.I'm going through that with my heavily gimped IPad 2.  How is the hardware for a 4 1/2 year old Samsung Galaxy or any of the other comparable phones?"
"Is this just Apple?To be honest I've thought this for years, the updates definitely slow things down, kill battery life, basically turn the phone into a piece of shit so the new one which is no better than the old one was when it came out looks better by comparison."
"I went from 4S to Lumia 930 and I'm back on a 5S because I was fucking annoyed with the 930 (massive lack of apps and general functionality, even the stock music app was garbage) and managed to get a cheap 5S on eBay (I always buy handsets and contract separately, way cheaper)"
"I had bad experiences with a cheap android tablet years ago hence not going to android. But I'm considering it for my next phone now because the 5S is starting to do the same thing my 4S did basically confirming the updates are fucking the phones."
"Apple has a lot of value in its fashionable nature, technophobe friendly interface and widespread comparability but I don't care about the fashion (hence using an old model), not exactly a technophobe and they've done nothing else to win my business. I'm definitely seeing the potential in android much much more these days particularly with the freedom offered and the whole open source thing. I reckon I could give it another go.What android tablet was it?Oh fuck knows, weren't a big branded one, bought it off a bloke I met in the pub.There's your problem. ;)Well I put cyanogen on it, just thought the interface was pointlessly complex and there wasn't enough built in media compatability."
"I like to keep handheld devices simple, useful and cost effective. More important things in life.The good thing about Android is broad range of choices. The bad thing about Android is this means there are demonstrably bad choices available. This was especially true back 5 years ago when the entire market was nascent.What ?Things and stuff.Oh ok. Got itI have an iPhone and HTC One M7 (I need both because I support both at work).  HTC is not going to upgrade it to 6.0 (Lollipop) because it's 3 years old and considered obsolete. "
"If Apple stopped providing updates after 3 years for their products they'd be sued for that too... MS is uograding old phones to W10. Guess MS are the good guys now.Windows Phone had SO much potential, but developers just aren't interested in it. I don't understand why, because its the best mobile OS imo. But, the app support is shit, making the phone basically obsolete compared to everything else.>  HTC is not going to upgrade it to 6.0 (Lollipop)"
"6.0 is Marshmallow and barely any non-Nexus devices have it at this point.I think the difference is that the core functions of the M7 continue to work unhindered. Only support from third party will drop. Android 6.0 is Marshmallow unless you mesnt to type in 5.0The point is, unlike many Apple products, the M7 and other Android devices don't get updates that render the phone useless and force you to upgrade (ed: to a newer phone).Pretty sure my 2nd-gen ipod touch stopped getting updates two or three years after it came out. They certainly had stopped by year 4.Girlfriend just replaced her 4S with a Oneplus x.  Im hoping this is a trend [deleted]Me too. Am happily writing this on an android device. I don't miss constantly updating that iTunes bloatware either.$5 million for a company with $200 billion in cash.  That's like someone suing me for 15 cents.  Never has a law suit seemed less climactic.  Oh, so damages in tort law are set on the basis of deterrence? Crazy the entire point of a remedy in tort law is for the tortfeasor to put injured party back into the position they would have been BUT FOR the tort, but hey your imaginary law degree must tell you other wise.This case is not about the money.  If Apple is found guilty of this (and doesn't manage to settle), then this could cause serious harm to Apple's brand (which really is their biggest selling point).Something tells me it's less about the money and more about getting apple to admit to tampering.They shouldn't ante up. Most people that complain about their older phones going slower after an update don't understand that your hardware hasn't changed while your software has. It's bound to slow down. You can't sue Rockstar because your 2012 standard computer can't run GTA V. "
"Either upgrade your physical phone or don't upgrade your software. Settling can be dangerous because of the precedence that it may set, regardless of how much cash they can shell out without hurting them in the short run. Yeah, they're gonna need the head intern to sign off on this payment. Even then, it will be dismissed. They may have lost 15 cents - but what about the bad publicity?But if the lawsuit succeeds, it might also set precedence for future lawsuits. Well, now that Apple has conceded these facts, that might imply that these other things are true..Thats $5 M more than what I have right now. Imagine you actually have to hire a lawyer to defend you against a lawsuit for 15 cents, because if you just pay it, a MILLION other people will do the same thing, so you have to hire a lawyer, go to trail, and put up with a ton of litigation and have a thousand conversations with a hundred people you hate, just to get out of paying that 15 cents that you could not possibly care less about. 15 cents, the antidyslexic brother of its 35c surplus.It feels like they are being sued by Dr. Evil. You must have $6,000.And they'll fight it, too. Yes, but large organisations do lots of cost control, so it will have somewhat of an impact. "
"If you attribute the cost to the iPhone department, it gives a hit to the profitability of their product. On the balance sheet, iPhone 4S sales revenue - costs to produce = profit margin - lawsuit = profit? All that because they were nice enough to continue supporting the 4S? Considering the lawsuit, ending support for the 4S might have been a better option.They 100 percent should have stopped updating the phone how hard is that to understand that is the entire issue. It worked  before the new update and now it doesn't that is the problem.  Why in the world do you consider an update that makes the phone worse a good thing that people should be grateful for? Great question. There has to be a feature somewhere they wanted to roll out to the most people possible. Not sure what it is though.Dude is trying to get paid off.0.025%. For me it would be $0.23. Nice.I was gonna say I picture Apple has like a swear jar in their office just times 100,000 where they take money out to pay off lawsuits like this.You got six grand in the bank? Nice. I'll take you extra 15 cents!Sorry man, that other poster already has dibs (I ain't made of money).  We've worked out a complex call and response so I can make sure its him when we run into each other some day. "
"I will give you a hint with the starter.  The falcon's song calls to the whale at midnight.  Shouldn't the damages be in some reasonable relation to the actual loss suffered by the plaintiffs? Or if a car operated by Apple is caught driving too fast, should Apple be fined 100 million or the same amount as everyone else?So you have $6000?/r/theydidthemathI thought the same thing. I think they'll go to court just to get free press coverage, or just for fun.In this case I honestly think they'll fight it tooth and nail, and spend $100 million if need be to avoid paying the $5 million.  "
"A ruling that says they were wrong in breaking old technology with new updates sets a scary precedent at best means they can't fuck over customers again in the future, and at worth obligates them to support and ensure optimum functionality for devices until they physically fall apart.  "
"For a company whose success is very dependent upon getting you to buy the new version of their product every year or two, that's a scary concept.  "
"Hell, it wouldn't surprise me if Google, Sony, and every other electronics company lined us to help pay the legals bills for them.  "
"Except Google's updates to Android don't stunt the devices. In fact the latest update solved a few crash issues. Google relies more on pumping you advertising then selling units (ever noticed no Google brand Androids exist?). To get away with this they want every machine to be running its best. They will not back Apple in this.>In this case I honestly think they'll fight it tooth and nail, and spend $100 million if need be to avoid paying the $5 million."
"As a former Apple employee, this is truly the way they think. They'd rather spend $100M to protect the brand and clear their name however they possibly can rather than settle it for $5M. They're not your typical corporation that will pay you off to shut you up. If you're going to talk shit about them, you better be willing to tango.>obligates them to support and ensure optimum functionality for devices until they physically fall apart."
"Or perhaps only to give people the option to roll back to previous software versions, even if those versions will not be supported.No, if anything, Google, Sony, and every other electronics company will pay to help push this case forward to fuck Apple. Its in their best interest that Apple get hung out to dry on this.No, they'll settle, and there will be no precedent set, just some shutup money paid out of the near-infinite pot they have.Yeah that's true but it'll have to go to trial. If they settle then  they can still do this shit. The ones suing have to bite the bullet and take all of apples shit eg injunction after injunction and possibly a couple years of court precedings to show that it really is for the principle of the matter. If they're just in it for the money then they will take a settlement. So lets hope they're in it to win it. Right. This is the point, not the paltry financial value."
"As a company, Apple should take this as a warning that the bite-point they've set for planned obsolescence is perhaps a little tougher than the market can bear."
"Also, it might be worth considering an after-market app store for older phones that can't be updated. There may be more money in that, as there's a lot of old phones floating around. The backend logistics of that are a pain in the ass, but it's still money.I have an Ipad 3 that's been running like shit for awhile.  Can't even stream Netflix, Amazon, or youtube vid without constant restarts and shit.  "
"Everything else streams fine, other 2 android tablets, phone, Roku, Comcast, AppleTV.... Ipad can't do shit anymore.  I gave my dad an old Ipad 2 that he hasn't updated and it still runs fine.  Finally bought a Samsung Tab 2 10 inch a few weeks ago to replace it and it works fine.  "
"TL:DR - IO suspect they did the same thing to the Ipads.  Will they sue Android for patent infringing over 'forced buys by crippling upgrades' ? "
"#schutzpahI agree with your rationale, but the lawsuit is hinging on the fact that Apple does not allow users to downgrade to a previous version. So iOS 9 users with upgrader's remorse cannot go back to iOS 8."
"I understand Apple's side as well, they don't want previous exploits and vulnerabilities re-activated, which hurts the security of their platform."
"I mention this because Google and Microsoft both allows user this freedom (at the expense of possible exploits on outdated OS versions).You can sort of downgrade from windows 10 there's a time limited windowYou can always downgrade from any version of Windows at any time. I could install XP on my desktop if I wanted to."
"That's one thing I hate about Apple's approach to how they control their hardware and software.I see what you mean! I meant the o back to windows 8.1 button on win 10 upgradesExcept that's not how other phone manufacturers introduce obsolescence. They really don't have that much control over software, so they either don't offer updates at all, or put shifty parts in so that the hardware breaks. "
"Apple phones are extremely reliable, so this is their only plan of action.For planned obsolescence, the most common tactic is to make the battery non user replaceable. The current best batteries from companies like panasonic, offer around a 1500 cycle charge endurance, with an almost linear drop in capacity after each charge cycle for the first 800 or so cycles, and then a more rapid drop for the remaining cycles as the internal resistance of the battery increases."
"By making batteries non user replaceable, you end up with a smart phone that has lost around 30% of its capacity after 2 years. "
"With a gradual loss in capacity, you will unconsciously change your use habits (checking the phone less, lower screen brightness, etc.), thus by the time for the planned obsolescence, you are a bit frustrated with your current phone, and are ready to upgrade, at which point you will feel that the new phone lasts much longer, restarting that cycle."
"In a smartphone, the battery is the shortest lived component. Everything else can potentially last multiple decades of regular use with no problem. "
"While many phone makers on the android side, will stop releasing updates after 1 year to 18 months, you always have the option to install a 3rd party ROM, and continue to receive updates (assuming you chose the right phone, and not something using a really obscure SOC).> In a smartphone, the battery is the shortest lived component. Everything else can potentially last multiple decades of regular use with no problem."
"Good point.  Over the coming years we will see a lot of otherwise usable devices tossed because replacing the batteries is too much of a pain.  That being said lack of vendor updates to newer OS versions or newer versions run painfully slow is another factor.Except, in many cases the manufacturer offers a battery repair for far cheaper than the cost of a new device. The real toll is not reliability but the perception of performance."
"With new OS versions, they typically add new features and services. These now compete with resources (CPU time and memory), causing slowdown on others. Newer hardware can scale the software better, which makes it run faster (and seem less annoying)."
"You could have an iPhone 2G on AT&T's EDGE network, running the original iOS 1.x. Doesn't mean EDGE won't feel slow... yet we seemed to think it was a blessing from the gods back when it first came out."
"People seem to have a hard time realizing that technology does not age nearly as well as they think it should, mostly because of how everything is relative. If you get 100 Mbps at home and 1Mbps on your phone, you're gonna feel like your phone's network sucks. If you get it on both, your phone seems fast and convenient."
"The problem with that is that many companies will want $100 or so for a replacement battery. Considering that most users end up buying their phone on contract, the cost of replacing it will from that point of view, seem similar to just getting another phone on contract."
"Even in the absence of a contract (full priced), a user who is unable to go through the process of replacing the battery them self will be reluctant to spend an extra money on a phone that is already around 2 years old. Making the battery non user replaceable is truly an effective strategy to force people into upgrading, especially in a time where hardware performance is at a level where diminishing returns have long kicked it. e.g., compare the last 2-3 generations of quad core and higher flagship SOC. "
"The CPU has largely stopped being a bottleneck, same for read and write performance for the RAM. "
"The latest area where phone makers have been competing, is the NAND performance,though the performance differences are relatively small."
"Instead of finding other areas to invest in in order to differentiate by hardware, phone makers are finding ways to make the hardware desirable in the beginning, and frustrating by the time the next phone is released. "
"There are still many other areas where phone makers can innovate to set their hardware apart from the rest, but it requires a good amount of R&D to bring the cost down. For example, a new phone that moves from 6 bit with FRC displays, to 10 bit per channel displays. A properly calibrated 10 bit display (when displaying 10 bit+ content), can create some very realistic looking visuals, especially when viewing 14 bit images from a DSLR. The color reproduction and good looking gradients will be a great step up. Only issue is that true 10 bit (no FRC) panels are typically only found in super high end monitors designed for graphic design and video production.Don't be ridiculous. This will never go to court. They'll settle. Maybe I misread, why does Apple have to support older devices? If the new iOS is too intensive, tough titties! That does not give them the OK to intentionally bog down older hardware   more than new hardware.This is a common law country, that means that if a court says that Apple was wrong for releasing an OS that didn't work well on an old phone, well now it's suddenly law."
"Apple will fight this tooth and nail because if they lose this case it means a whole bunch of people can sue them every time they release a new OS for an old phone, a win here is worth FAR more than $5mil for Apple.They don't have to release the new OS versions for old phones.  The end result if the lose is Apple will stop updated old phones after they are end of life.That's perfectly fine.  I encourage them to stop updating their old phones.  Let them stay at whatever update gives the best performance in the phones life cycle. New apps will come out that will not support the old OS anymore but that's fine because the phone is too slow to run the app well anyway. Kill 2 birds with one stone,  phone stays responsive and isn't bricked by an update that is advertised to make it better and people have a more valid reason to upgrade IF THEY WANT TOO.   Don't force people to upgrade with shit ass updates that break the phone.  If someone is happy with a phone that can only make calls/text/email and browse the Web and doesn't give a shit about the newest face book app or W. E then let them be.  All they really have to do is continue to provide signed versions of their old updates just so if the new updates do break something on your phone it doesn't stay permanently broken."
"That's the big issue for the case is that apple updates can break your phone, but there's no way to rollback and unbreak it.They don't, they just lied about it. They said iOS was fully compatible with the iPhone 4s and it wasn't at all and basically makes the phone a buggy mess. If they had simply said it isn't compatible with iPhone 4s nobody would be upset.Ah so basically its the same code base, they just made claims that iPhone 4 hardware was good enough, when it really isn't?that's the thing. if the new ios software is too intensive, why is it being pushed to all of the previous devices with antiquated hardware? So you buy the new hardware.which is the point of the lawsuit. Why should I have to buy the newest iphone when they said that the new ios they were pushing on me every single day via my old hardware would work fine on the one that I had when in reality it doesnt and going back to an older version that actually did work is a nightmare? "
"It's like if you had a car and suddenly after 5 years it's much less useful because the manufacturer decided all of the cars from the past 6 years needed an update. Except, that updated part wasn't part of the original engineering of your car. It's still sort of mandatory to replace that part because all of your check engine lights are firing, but when you finally replace it you discover it actually makes your car worse and the manufacturer says 'oh, you should buy a new car'. They could just not allow super old devices to update...Yeah, and this already happens.  (I have a super old iOS device that can't be updated any more.)   They specifically chose to make  *this* update available on *this* hardware.There's a massive difference between not supporting obsolete technology and releasing updates that actively make it worse. "
"Ford stopped warranty work on my 85 LTD in 1990 (long before I even owned it), but they didn't come over to the house and de-tune the engine and slash the tires. I sold it in 2001, and it still ran fine. Question: Does Apple force you to upgrade your iOS?Apple prevents you from undoing the update.It is the only way to get security updates.  No, Apple does not force you to update your iPhone. I still believe that the problem lies in the fact that you can't downgrade after-the-fact. A lot of people will be smart and wait for a go-ahead from other people online, but what about the people that updated only to realize that their phone is impossible to use now? "
"If you had a computer that ran Windows 98, and you updated to Windows 10, I'm sure that it would be next to impossible to use (assuming you somehow manage to install it), but at least you can downgrade back. This obviously isn't the best example since 98 hasn't been supported for years, but it's good enough. Exactly, none of this would be an issue if you could downgrade the damn phones. I understand some of the reasons that they prevent you from doing so (app piracy), but they could allow you to go back to the latest version of major releases back to the one that your device shipped with, allowing them to patch loopholes if they even cared at that point."
"It's a potentially big issue on the enterprise level too. If you are relying on a device for business purposes and an app developer and/or Apple updates an app or the OS in some combination that doesn't work any longer you can not update, but if you get new devices or have a crash, you're unable to restore to anything but the newest version.Question: How often are you willing to press remind me later on your phone?"
"Like that is it? I've not used an iPhone for more than a few seconds.This shit I wish I knew how to turn it off because i get asked 5-8 times per day...it's ridiculous I even select to ask later at latest possible and shit still comes back hoping i accidentally press yes.I hope the answer is infinitely, for all eternity. Not directly, but as app companies do drop support for versions of their apps that run on older devices, and in a lot of cases the unsupported versions actually quit working and tell you to upgrade (which you can't without upgrading the OS).  "
"Apple doesn't force you to upgrade, but they strongly nag/recommend it for supported devices, and only the latest OS contains the latest security fixes."
"Aside from App atrophy, there's the fact that upgrading is a one-way street with Apple: once you upgrade your OS, you can never go back.  So if you upgrade and find that there's no longer enough memory available to run your go-to apps (crashes during loading, slower than usable response, etc.) there's absolutely nothingn you can do short of taking the hardware in for a rebate on a hardware upgrade (or finding a way to root the device and disable a bunch of daemons, or flashing it with an alternative OS).Can confirm. I get a pop up once a week or so. But I never let this little shit biscuit update. As a result it still works fine. > For a company whose success is very dependent upon getting you to buy the new version of their product every year or two, that's a scary concept."
"Hmm, I was trying to be funny, but in all seriousness - looks like you have a point.The consequence of winning this lawsuit will be pretty simple: Apple will just stop offering software updates beyond 2-3 generations, like how Android phones currently are."
"2-3 generation? Try 1. My Motorola Maxx was supposed to receive Android 5.0 when it came out and it was only a year-ish old. Never got it. It may be the carrier as opposed to Motorola. Carriers traditionally have to approve and roll out updates, although it sounds like you have a droid, which is a Verizon exclusive.Moto maxx was the international version of the droid turbo, so not locked into Verizon. Motorola really fucked up by releasing both phones after 5.0 was out without 5.0, then took 8 months to update the turbo to 5.1, but apparently never got around to updating the international version. "
"Which, you know, if said generations work would be be a better alternative than to push notifications to update your software until you give in. This so much. I am so god damned annoyed with half of the shit on my new iPhone. The stupid built in apps Apple won't let you delete, built in U2 ring tones, and the forced notifications. And the ever increasingly annoying forced consumer dependence on iTunes."
"I had a 3GS up until earlier this year, that ran flawlessly because I only updated th software once. Yeah, I chose to skip the bigger issue to laugh at how a big number to us is a joke to companies of that size, but this seriously could have major repercussions for the companies that make the devices that run our lives.

I have a 4S and it is pretty slow and flaky, last week at the gym my entire itunes library simply disappeared.  apple does this and the community barley cares... but this same community freaks out when Comcast essential does the same thing... I'm no Comcast supporter but double standard??????Nothing. People's expectations are way too high. A company is not obligated to support your device after you buy it - let alone a 5 year old device. To win a lawsuit there must be have been some harm committed. What harm has been committed by Apple by supporting a device that is 5 years old? A slower customer experience? That hardly fits the definition of harm. IANAL, but there is a well established legal principle known as an implied warranty- you bought a product designed to do certain things.  If the device fails to do those things, then it is defective, and the manufacturer does indeed ave skin in the game.You said ianal lol?Right but then define failed. "
"Hypothetical example: Taking twice as long to open the camera does not mean the camera failed, it was simply slower than you are used to."
"I doubt it would hold up in court.If you're going to use implied warranty as a reason then they're too late. No state has implied warranties last longer than 4 years, and the 4s has passed the 4 year mark a while ago. There's 'slow' and there is slow to the point of being unproductive.But that's too subjective. How would you identify actual harm?Well, the iPhone is advertised to be able to perform a number of tasks - in particular, ios9 is supposed to bring a number of productivity features to the user - primarily speed. When a user cannot open the camera app until well after a photo opportunity presents itself, or when it takes 3 minutes to open a web page - then there is harm from the loss of productivity, not to mention misleading/false advertising. When you've turned a $900 computer into a $30 Pentium IV computer that can only run minesweeper, you have reduced the value of the product substantially.If the iPhone acted that way right after purchase and Apple refused to give you a refund or fix the issue, then perhaps you might have a case - but not after 4 years. The lawsuit is not about getting updates to older devices its a case of false advertising. Apple advertised IOS 9 as improving user performance on the 4S however it proved to be laggy and unsuited for the 4S creating a unusable phone due to crashing. It's a valid claim that Apple shouldn't have advertised IOS 9 for Iphone 4S if it didn't support it.But there is still no harm. iOS updates are free. Its not about physical harm. It mislead consumers to updgrading to IOS 9 which made the devices unusable and caused systems to fail on the phone. That was harm to how the consumer was advertised a IOS that was compatible amd improved the system yet did the opposite. As I mentioned in another comment ASUS MeMo Pad 8 is virtually unusable. But that's subjective. For some the slowness is a non-issue. It's hard to decide what harm & damages have been realized which is required to win a lawsuit. /r/hailcorporate"
"If an upgrade that was supposed to make my device better instead makes it borderline unusable, that's harm."
"What if a mechanic promised to service your car for free, and instead fucked your car up so it would barely run.  Would you argue that there was no harm because it was free?I've heard of so many people having this happen to them...  Which is the main reason why I refuse to ever purchase an Apple product.  That and their incompatible chargers.  Fuck them.You might get a check for $3.12 in 4 years Go to the App Store and tap one of the bottom bar's icons ten times in a row, then see if it's back to normal.Have you tried to disable spotlight?"
"Settings > general > spotlight search and remove all itens. Worked for me.iOS 9 requires **much** more RAM and other resources, what are people expecting to happen? It's like trying to put a VHS in a blu-Ray player Apple will stop misleading consumers with new IOS updates probably, and/or be forced to allow clean downgrades. "
"Either are good for consumers (Apple constantly makes deceptive claims, and I'm surprised nobody else has threatened a lawsuit against them)."
"It's a win-win. Actually more likely they'll just stop offering software updates for devices beyond 2-3 generations, the way android manufacturers currently do."
"as long as they offer security updates, i don't think that's too bad of a  solution.AFAIK that is tied into the upgrades...Point releases can easily be security updates."
"So instead of iPhone 4s getting iOS 9 it could have gotten iOS 8.5 with the security enhancements and nothing else. > Apple will stop misleading consumers with new IOS updates probably"
"They may just stop supporting older devices sooner"
"> be forced to allow clean downgrades."
"Ha. Good luck. No one would do this. Downgrading is a complex as FUCK concept for any person not very knowledgable in technology. Many don't even understand what an operating system is and you're going to explain to them how to go back to a previous one? It'll never happen smoothly.There's no reason that downgrades can't be made as smooth as upgrades.  The problem is cost.  There's very little incentive for a company to provide a slick downgrade process.  Upgrading fucks up all the time too, so it probably wouldn't be that different. Just uninstall and reinstall an older version. I get the feeling you've never done retail or tech support with common folks (the majority of Apple's customers). I've actually worked for Apple Care for a year back in the day. It's *painful*. I'm surprised they even understand how to install apps."
"> Grandma: Apple, my phone is so gosh darn slow. Why!?"
"> Apple: Hi Ma'am, sorry you're having issues. It looks like you're using an older version of the iPhone so it may be best to install an older versi..."
"> Grandma: Older version? It's an iPhone! What other versions could there be!?"
"> Apple: Well ma'am we just release the iPhone 6S. You have an iPhone 4S. We have since released an iPhone 5, 5S, 6 and now the 6S since you purchased your phone."
"> Grandma: I have an iPhone what? I just want it to not be so gosh darn slow"
"> Apple: Okay Ma'am. First I need you to go into your settings app"
"> Grandma: What's a settings app?"
"> Apple: It's a gray square with a gear on it somewhere on your home screen"
"> Grandma: A home screen? I don't know what that is but I don't see a gear"
"5 hours pass"
"> Apple: and now your phone is restored to iOS 7! You should have a much faster phone now"
"> Grandma: Where are all my pictures? My grandchildren are gone! What did you do with them!?"
"> Apple: Ma'am, when I walked you through backing up your data, did you follow all of my instructions?"
"> Grandma: What instructions? I just want my grandchildren back! How can I even call my son!?It's probably not easy but it's not impossible.  For iPhones they could develop an option to create an image backup in iTunes before the update, if you're not happy with how it's performing you can restore the backup to the previous version. Different OS altogether but my Surface 3 did this for the Windows 10 upgrade. You can rollback to Windows 8.1 within 30 days if you want. That feature saved a friend's ass. She updated and it broke a lot of medical field software she uses, i rolled back and everything went fine after.Just wipe the system on downgrade. I've done it easily enough on Android, why not iOS too?Obviously you want to preserve the user's settings in an official downgrade process, which rules out wiping the system.Because it fucks Apple. Now any previous iOS exploits still have teeth because people may decide to fall back on it. By having people upgrade and not able to go back helps close these vulnerabilities in the wild, and for good."
"It also hurts developers. The nice part about iOS is that people often do upgrade rather quickly compared to Android/Windows. Being able to use shiny new iOS features as a developer within months not years is quite nice. Waiting for X% user adoption can suck."
"Also then how far back should Apple go? Just one iOS version back? Two? All possible for the device? See above.> Also then how far back should Apple go? Just one iOS version back? Two? All possible for the device? See above."
"the last version that didnt fuck up users phones. Its not really that hard. Just treat the previous version as the final 4s version.Is it really night and day difference for iOS 8 vs iOS 9 on the device? I don't have one to test myself, so I am genuinely curious.no idea, im using 7.1.2 and no intention of upgrading to find outLike /u/BinaryIdiot said, most people don't even know how to get to the about screen that shows them the iOS version they're running. Downgrading is not a difficult thing to do, but it's much more involved than factory resetting.>it's much more involved than factory resetting"
"The point is that it doesn't have to be."
"Upgrading an operating system used to be an event that took your x86 tower computer *hours* to complete, and you needed someone knowledgeable to assist with it"
"Now, you can upgrade your mobile phone's entire operating system by tapping a button after opening a notification. Even Windows and OS X are pretty simple for the average user to upgrade nowadays."
"Downgrading *could* be just as simple, even if it required wiping the device. Especially with iOS where the default setting is to back up absolutely everything to iCloud, and it's trivial to make backups of all your app data via iTunes, there's no real reason that Apple couldn't include a revert to a previous version option somewhere in the Settings app and make it possible. So what if nobody knows where the button is? The first thing anyone who thinks they *need* such a feature will do is ask Google, which would likely point them directly to it.Consider this: it's no easier to downgrade a PC.  A proper downgrade will make sure you start clean without the trouble of remnants of the old. That's something you just can't do with a tap of a button. Then you'll have users complaining why the downgrade process leaves behind a multigygabytve other portion of used space on the device."
"Downgrading is not as simple as just clicking a button and saying delete all of the other files that weren't there before.  Actually Windows 10 does have a downgrade option back to Windows 8.1, 8, or 7."
"Just doesn't keep any changes you've had since upgrading to Windows 10.Was not aware, thank you.Plug it into iTunes and click restore like you could on older iPhones."
"Nothing special about that, don't need to be a genius to do it either. To you and I this is trivial. Try to guide a completely oblivious person with very little to no technical experience, people who don't still don't even know how to install a program FFS. Everybody doesn't just get these kinds of things and you're forgetting that."
"Ever wonder why if you buy a phone in-store, the majority of the time they'll guide you through the initial setup? How many people after getting a new device as a gift don't end up going for one on one help to get it setup? This stuff is trivial but there are many many people who just can't do it. I wish I never updated the to 8.4. The music app is sooooo awful now. This is a non event. Lawsuits sound salacious but they're only used because they're the only avenue for complaints. This is a basic complaint framed in a way to force Apple to respond. Apple will give a standard response which sounds logical and it will go away. The fact that the suit is seeking only 5 million goes to show how little confidence the prosecution has in their claims. "
"By the way, good luck getting Apple to give you any more 5 year updates. Apple has always been good with leaving legacy phones with buttery smooth software on their *final* update. e.g. iOS 6.0.3, 7.1.4. Now they're just not going to bother giving you the update in the first place. "
"Keep in mind that it is nigh logistically impossible to focus resources on tuning performance for a 5 year phone while there are new phones springing bugs left and right. Which is why they always leave the legacy phones for the last update, when all the other bugs have been hashed out. Yes they could offer a downgrade option, but that will open a whole new can of worms for newer phone which is simply not worth the cost:benefit. "
"They had no social obligation to give a 5 year old phone anything, which is already way longer than any other manufacturer (2 years Samsung/Microsoft, 3 years Google). Yet they did, believing in putting the customer first. Well, they've definitely learned their lesson now.> The fact that the suit is seeking only 5 million goes to show how little confidence the prosecution has in their claims."
"The suit is not seeking only 5 million.  $5 million is a jurisdictional threshold for the court so class actions typically plead damages in excess of $5 million, as this one did.  28 U.S.C. SS 1332(d) requires the amount in controversy to be in excess of 5 mil exclusive of interest and costs, so that's what is in the complaint.Except they're *not* putting the customer first, they're (allegedly) deliberately sabotaging their customers' devices in order to force them to pay more moneyApple isn't in the making updated software business.  They are in the phone selling business.  Im fairly certain the updates slow phones down by design.  Otherwise, who'd buy their shiny new minimally updated version every year?I'm pretty sure you're using the word salacious wrong. Just to double check, I looked up the definition. Yep, definitely wrong. Unless you mean the lawsuit is very sexual in manner, then carry on. > Apple has always been good with leaving legacy phones with buttery smooth software on their final update."
"Except this time right?I believe he means they haven't had their final update yet. I seem to recall this happening at least twice in the past where the first few releases work terribly on the older phones, and then later on they final get an update out that more or less works as well as the last update on the previous major release.My 4S is just fine after turning the motion/zoom animations off.  People will bitch about anythingMine still runs like an uncaffeinated paraplegic girl."
"I like my 4s, I've see the 5 come and go, 6c 6s, considered 6s+ until I got a Phablet 8 core 10 in 4K screen for 1/4 the price. Still, I do most with my handy 4s.[deleted]runs. And the problem is that downgrading is a fucking nightmare on iPhones.Nightmare? It's just not possible, it just doesn't happen. Define runs. That's kind of the premise of the suit.[deleted]9 was slower, but a week later they gave another update and fixed it.That's anecdotal though, just as anecdotal my girlfriend bought a Z5 because her 4S was getting insanely slow and frustrating on iOS 9, to the point it turned her off iPhones. Not everyone is a power user, and the appeal of Apple (at least, in the PC) world it just works.It's not just the 4S though, the iPod Touch 5th gen has the same innards but is newer and only 1 generation old, but is already nigh on unusable.Buttery smooth? The final update had never left anything buttery smooth.Ah no you misunderstand, it's as if you melted butter over your phones processor as a coolant. Now that's Butterysmooth(tm)Which would be fine, if they let users roll back to a specific versionAccording to the article Apple promised that the Iphone 4s would be compatible and work great on Ios 9 while users experienced lagging and crashes that made the phone unusable. This isn't a case about apple not providing support over a long time for all devices but rather using an update to force users to upgrade. As the article states you can't downgrade from IOS 9 even though it ran better before the update. This would be a case of false advertising and possibly more. Even if the cost of the lawsuit is nothing to Apple, it may put them in a bad spot with forcing users to buy new phones in order to use them and thus ruin its reputation among users.> They had no social obligation to give a 5 year old phone anything"
"I think the complaint is more that Apple says This download will improve performance and instead it breaks your phone. If they advertised it as iOS 9, not suitable for 4S phones then people wouldn't be bitching.To add to it, not just that this update will improve performance, but that you should update, and once you do you are stuck with it even if it does not improve things. The problem with this is even if apple allowed you to roll back, most users might not be able to do it unless apple provided official support, which I don't think is worth their time and effort. They would never phrase the introduction of newer software in a bad way. Yes, and that's the problem. Because it means people can't tell whether they should use it or not. If you don't ever say the software is bad, even when it *is* bad, then you deserve to get sued, methinks."
"There's nothing wrong with phrasing the software download as not suitable for version 4 phones any more than saying you must have at least 256M of graphics memory to play this game is describing the game as bad.Then just don't provide it.Exactly. With Android, stick to Kitkat for old devices and maybe do a factory reset and it should work fine. Want Marshmallow? It's not gonna be pretty. Apple should inform users of old devices, This will fuck things up - buy a new device or stick with your current system.The problem is you can't always just stick with your current system. If I want to reinstall my iPad Mini 1 (currently on iOS 7), I can't install iOS 7 again. I _have_ to install iOS 9."
"The problem isn't so much with their rhetorics, but the fact that you're forced to install the newest version if you need to reinstall.Lollipop actually improved the performance of my 2012 Nexus 7. It didn't repair the broken usb port, though.Marshmallow runs beautifully on my two year old Nexus 5. Google has focused on optimizing Android for older and low power hardware since KitKat.I was just telling someone how Lollipop ruined my Galaxy S5 and slowed it down to a crawl. Even after doing all the recommended fixes like clear the cache, ect. My carrier bombarded me with an update notice that wouldn't go away, be nice if they said some users may see device performance issues upgrade at your own risk.>My carrier bombarded me with an update notice"
"If you pull down the notification window, long hold on the update notification you'll get a little tab that says app info. Go in to that and then un-check allow notifications. Should clear it up.Well that's because it's running *TouchWiz* Lollipop, not stock. You can blame the lag on Samsung; I'm running Marshmallow perfectly fine on my S5 with CyanogenMod.I've been really lazy when it comes to my phone and what you can do with it. I know there are always better work arounds, just feel burnt out on learning new stuff and keeping up. Kind of embarrassing coming from a tech background but I just appreciate stuff working when I don't need to do demanding or special stuff with it. I spend enough time on my computer I don't want to spend my time fixing some companies bloatware. End rant.Then buy a near stock device like Nexus, Motorola, Nvidia, etc...Seriously. Touchwiz is cancer and Samsung should be the ones sued for this. My one year old S5 became buggy, unstable, and insanely slow. The S6 was absolutely golden though. I bet the same damn thing is going to happen to the S6 when the S7 comes out. "
"Samsung purposefully screws over ONE YEAR OLD phones that would work beautifully if they just stuck to stock Android. That is purposefully gimping hardware to force people to upgrade. I don't know why Google allows that shit. My mother is still using my 2+ year old s4 with no slowdowns or problems that I gave her when I upgraded.  I don't know what Samsung did to the s5 that everyone complains about it but I skipped that generation and got a note 5. She also has an iPhone 4 I gave her that she never updated and uses like an ipod that still runs smooth,  just can't get alot of new apps. That's Samsung's fault, not Google's. Lollipop and Marshmallow ROMs run beautifully on my S3. Yeah, someone else said to install a ROM. I guess it's time.Go for AOSP based over CM based, it'll be worth it. I know exactly nothing about what you're talking about. Can you point me to a guide to this for dummies? My s5 is running like a turtle in peanut butter since the update in July (?). I tried all the recommended fixes, even traded the phone off on the insurance, and it's still shit.my 4s was completely fine until i got the upgrade. I'm absolutely certain they do this on purposeMy iPhone 4S was pretty slow before iOS 9 and actually got faster with the update.Or what if the hardware simply does not support the new software? It's damned if they do, damned if they don't. "
"**If they do (as they have):** Apple intentionally slows down our phones so we have to buy a new device!"
"**If they cut compatibility early:** Apple intentionally cuts compatibility so we have to buy a new device!"
"It's a hard balance and allowing people to downgrade is not a better alternative for the eco-system (and security).Or you release updates which improve performance rather than cut it. Lollipop did and Windows 10 did this. But anyway the slower features in ios 9 can disabled it seems. It sped up my 5s. Especially the new app switcher. That's not true."
"If you buy a device, you expect it to continue to have the functionality it had when you bought it. You don't expect it to suddenly become unusable (without actually breaking it), but you also can't expect to get all sorts of new features later on."
"You don't buy a manual lawn mower, then complain a year later when a new automatic lawn mower comes out, that your lawn mower isn't automatic as well."
"It is, however, very fair (in my opinion), that you complain if your lawn mower suddenly stops functioning probably after a year."
"Apple are crippling users' devices by forcing them to install software that doesn't work properly on the devices."
"EDIT: GrammarIt would work the same as it did when you bought it if you didn't download software made for phones like 10x faster. If you want to reinstall, you have to update.>Apple are crippling users' devices **by forcing them** to install software that doesn't work properly on the devices."
"Where does Apple *force* anyone to update? You don't have to if you don't want to.If you're naive enough to think that you'll never have to reinstall your device for it to still perform decently, then no, you're right, you're not forced to update."
"In reality, however, you will eventually need to reinstall your device, and which case you are forced to update.It is choosing between two evil. How about the third option: update, and don't intentionally slow down the device? Or they could just release not shitty updates...Or they could release a better performing update?"
"Likely the issues come from a poor job of doing the update due to minimal resources being put at the task. It's not compatibility that the issue, it's wither or not they just out right stop the updatesI usually assume that my old phone runs fewer features and runs new features worse than a new phone. But make the browser start after 45 seconds and unlocking 5 times slower should not be necessary...This is the real summary of the entire issue. What is this fair and sensible comment doing in an Apple thread?Those aren't the only two options. They could continue to release security updates so people can keep using their phones while there is still a significant user base.Except app developers won't be supporting the older versions of iOS so people will complain that their phone can't run any of the new apps.Thats a far better situation than the current one where Apple fucks over their customersYou get years of compatibility and updates. The 4s was a *four year old phone* when iOS 9 came out. Does modern android run well on four year old devices?"
"Apple's not doing something wrong. They're still releasing software for devices an order of magnitude slower than what they have out right now. You always have the option of just not updating your software. They don't force it on you.  android versions are limited to models the os version they were designed for."
"Plus if i put a newer android os on my aging s3 id be able to take it off if it doesnt work well"
"The point isnt the support its the lack of reversabilityNah it's not. They're not suing for $5 million because Apple doesn't sign outdated insecure software. They're suing because they think that performance problems with a brand new OS on 4 year old mobile hardware are totally deliberate and meant to target them.Fair point- I didn't think about it this waySurely they can just release different tiers of updates for different phones? People are very capable of understanding that their older device is not capable of taking all of the new features, I'm sure they'd rather have fewer features than having their performance drowned by an update intended for a far more powerful device?They've done this in the past - I still have an old iPhone 3g and a first gen iPad that haven't been eligible for updates for quite some time.  The problem is they don't stop soon enough so you end up with a crippled device.  The problem is they don't want to step too far towards the fragmentation problems that Android has. Soon enough hey would be independently maintaining several versions of iOS.They do this already. The 4 never got Siri as the hardware couldn't handle the background tasks needed. Only 6s models have hey Siri when not plugged in to a charger. Etcthey must. there's no way they don't know it will happen"
"edit - or could be they just care so little they don't enquireTheir forums are full of users wanting to downgrade because their device get slowYou can't downgrade!?Nope. Even if you have an older device that you want to reinstall, you're forced to install the newest compatible version.And this is why I refuse to update my iPhone. but then all of your apps become unusable No they don't Mine do when they update What?  Apple doesn't allow for incompatibility so I'm not sure what you're saying. I've literally never had an app become unusable. I didn't update for a long time and all of my apps became unusable until I broke down and updated. I'm sure you seem to know everything about Apple but it doesn't change the fact that this is exactly what happened to me. I have auto update on. What apps became unusable?I'd just wish they'd offered an option for security fixes only."
"I'm using a 4S that auto-downloaded its update (1GB) while on my mobile broadband. I don't care about the extras that they've added, Chrome, Maps and several other important apps are painfully slow now."
"(On top of that, it changed its iCloud settings and tried to backup, using another 8GB of my mobile broadband data. Cost me a fucking fortune - thanks Australia.)"
"I always assumed they'd at least try to cater to older devices with each update, and regret ever updating this thing. Problem is, you never know which iteration to stick with until it's too late.Can you not wipe and manually restore to 8.x?"
"It was definitely possible during the iOS9 betas.you can for a short period of time around the release of the new os but after a while apple stops signing the security certificate and when that happens itunes won't do it anymoreThis, this this this this. They do it for every version of OS X, and the scheme's become more distinct since Lion, where they'll go up to 10.x.5, and then all further updates are app updates and/or security updates.> I'm using a 4S that auto-downloaded its update (1GB) while on my mobile broadband."
"How can I force mine to do this?  My iPhones always want to do it over WiFi, which is always slower and buggier than my LTE.Portable hotspotiPhones don't use cellular data to download updates unless you specifically prompt it to. And they cannot backup to iCloud through cellular unless it is jailbroken. So I don't know if you are just after free internet points or what but your story sucks.I assume he is referring to a mobile hotspot product. His phone thinks he is on wifi but it is cell backed wifi. I've had my phone do the same on mine. Bad luck that it decided to download the update while I was driving to work rather than at work on Corp wifi. I have to use a 4G hotspot because my phone doesn't work on Aussie 3G, so it thinks it's on wifi. There's no way of telling it to not auto-download while on wifi.  "
"Nvm I'm an idiot. I've been jail broken too long "
"Fair enough. If you use another Apple device as a hot spot it understands it shouldn't download that shit but any other type of hot spot (like one you're more likely to have) not so much.$5million? Did Doctor Evil file that lawsuit?Smithers, my wallets in my front right pocketOh, and I'll take that statue of justice too. What is this? A lawsuit for ants?allegedly? This has been happening since at least the iPhone 3, I remember whenever a new OS came out my phone would drastically slow down. I've had a 4 (not 4s) for awhile and it started getting slow few iOS updates ago.Also check out whited00r. I had a 3GS and I updated right after the 4 came out. Screwed my wifi and GPS. They said there wasn't anything to do and that I needed to get a new phone since it was too old. Left Apple and any other of their products I can avoid. Just makes that shiny new iPhone seem that much faster.Agreed. This was the main reason why I switched to Android. are you able to downgrade OS on an Android phone?Downgrade, upgrade, depends on model but yes, pretty doableIt's pretty easy to do just by following a guideI don't know how easy it is but yeahIt's really easy.Yes you canYes."
"It is a compromise however. By doing such, security of the platform is weakened (older, outdated versions are allowed). As a matter of fact, several Android devices rely on the fact you can flash old ROMs/bootloaders on to the device (which have the exploit necessary to root)."
"It also hurts the eco-system for developers, because now you have Android adoption rates which are all over the place because people can pick and choose. As of 2015, [~40% of people are still on Kit Kat](http://www.statista.com/statistics/271774/share-of-android-platforms-on-mobile-devices-with-android-os/). Meanwhile, [Apple gets ~35% adoption of iOS 9 within five days](http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/ios-9-adoption-rate-day-1-news/). This is a very big deal for developers."
"Freedom seems nice, but it has positive **and** negative effects. Not trying to say either side is better, but the rationale should be understood. Apple doesn't just do this to be an asshole.Freedom is better.Which is silly since there are dozens of of examples of updates causing similar issues on Android phones right in this thread. "
"Android has the exact same issues, and most Android phones don't get OS upgrades past 1.5 years. Not only that, Android phones that do get upgrades get them sometimes around 6 months later. Unless you're talking Nexus devices, then those updates are usually cool, but still affect performance especially on 3 year old Nexus devices. "
"The 4s is 4 years old.Apple is part of the problem here though. The 4s may be 4 years old, but it hasn't been 4 years since they've stopped selling it. They shouldn't be selling a device that could potentially be unusably slow in a year's time. Android phones are a bit different from Apple though. Apple build their phones AND operating system (OS) . Android build the OS but the vendor (say Samsung) releases OS upgrades. Some vendors are better than others at supporting older devices. "
"My Samsung Galaxy Note 3 still gets ROM updates, and failing that there is the open source community for CyanogenMod. My Note 3 should only have Android 5.1 but thanks to CyanogenMod I'm on 6.0.1.My Nexus 4 performed better on Android Lollipop than on my friend's iPhone 5 running iOS 8. Unfortunately it didn't get updated to Marshmallow though. Custom roms can bring it to 6.0 ;)iPhone 3 you say?I just wish they'd give the option to roll back to an earlier version.So can we sue Samsung now too for doing the same thing to the S5?iPhone 4 here and never went past 6.1.1. No reason for me to upgrade anymore since I got it jail broken to perfection. Security. Apps. If you're an iPhone. How did you learn of reddit?It's a smart phone.Apparently Steve Jobs was planning for Judgement Day. Tim Cook is now fulfilling his destiny.This has been posted three times in three days.Reddit loves an anti-Apple circlejerk. It's something negative about Apple, it'll hit front page at least three more times before people get tired of up voting it.Please.. Steve Jobs wiped his ass with $5 mil stacks. This is a joke. Why is this happening to Apple and not Android or other manufacturers like Samsung? I updated my Galaxy s5 a few weeks ago to the latest update (lollipop?) and it runs like shit now, sometimes unusably bad, and I know its not an isolated case.Because you can downgrade back to the previous version if you want (download image file and flash). Apple won't sign older versions of iOS so there's no way to downgrade. I bought an used iPhone 4s (didn't want to, but couldn't afford a decent Android phone) and thankfully it only had iOS 8 installed, but still I feel like that's worse than iOS 7. No way I'm updating to iOS 9.Has anyone asked who gets the 5 Mil?   Do all iPhone 4 users get like...a $1.35 cheque in the mail? My 4s is barely usable anyway because the battery life lasts about 45minsThe same people would be bitching if Apple simply didn't provide an update for old devices."
"New software with features for the newest devices which are much more powerful is going to run slower. An there is no incentive for Apple to spend engineering effort on an old as balls device which they aren't selling anymore and isn't making them money.The wife has a 4s and we were wondering what in the hell was wrong with it after upgrading to the ios 9. You'll be in the middle of a text, game, etc and the phone just stops registering your touches. its really frustratingNvidia has gotten away with this shit for years. I doubt Apple is the low hanging fruit here. It's not low hanging, but it is enormous.r/thatswhatshesaidDrivers? I'm going to call bullshit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZUshOSWQRoAs someone who has a 4s, who is experiencing this shit, how do I get in on this??Hell! Even my iPhone 6 got super slow after iOS9..The group sent this lawsuit to apple via fax and will respond to emails when the number for AOL is no longer busyIt's only the 8th time they have intentionally done that...must be by accident?Why am I not surprised my 4s couldn't load the webpage without crashing Can somebody hook me up with a few million for the day i updated my ipad 2? it hasnt worked right since. Worked like a dream from day one until the day after that update. Now it crashes several times a day. I dont have money for anything apple anymore, so even just a lousy couple of million would potentially convince me not to completely walk away from that company forever. Just waiting on the update that destroys my apple tv now that theres a new one. I hear chromecast works pretty well.I'm still using the 4S, where do I go to collect my monies?Here the thing I don't get with Apple.  iOS 9 sucks on an A5 series iDevice.  Why even support it?My mother's iPad 2 seems to get a little slower with every update. She's certain that they're doing it deliberately to pressure iPad 2 owners into buying newer models. At first it seemed silly - who would buy another Apple product after their last one slowed to a point of needing to be replaced after only a few years? But I'm starting to wonder if maybe she was right on this one.What about my iPad Air on iOS 9.0.2? Everything lags. I wish I hadn't updated."
"However, Apple's product cannibalization cycle is pretty bad when you can't afford a new device every year.My MIL's iPad mini suffers the same fate with iOS9. It's unusable almost, with a slew of problems like sluggishness, crashing/freezing and unresponsive touch input. Makes me just not want to touch it at all.I still remember when I upgraded my iPhone 3G to iOS 4. It made it practically unusable. This feels like a repeat of that time.They are obviously looking for out of court, would be impossible to prove Apple did this knowingly unless they know what emails to subpoena and even then I dont think any engineer would discuss something like this.Try being me going from an iPhone 6 to iPhone 5s to iPhone 4. The iPhone 4 is the slowest piece of shit I barely even use it, let alone charge it. be cool if they let you trade it in for a new model I have a 4s with 9.2 on it and though I had to reset all settings after this update, I do not see a slow down like described in this post."
"I wonder if people actually try to resolve technical issues before trying to sue a company. "
"And I only saw a battery drain issue until I reset the phones settings and then set it back up. I don't care to defend apple, but I personally do not see a problem with my 4s with 9.xI DESPISE Apple with a passion!"
"This silly lawsuit won't fix anything"
"It will just make the lawyers richI think Apple is probably covered by the EULA these people skipped over when upgrading.The entire IDEA of an EULA a user agrees to before using the product is against MANY laws, and hasn't itself been tested in court before.Even if explicitly stated in the EULA that some company reserves some right to do something to your device, such things often do not stand in court. If I wrote an OS but my EULA said I reserve the right to all information on your computer, such a thing would not stand in court.I don't think Apple is the only one but I am glad it is starting there.well honestly when you compare the iPhone 6s to the iPhone 4s there is a great difference, the iPhone 4s only has 512 mb of RAM as opposed to the 2 GB's of RAM in the 6s. plus the 4s has a 5 year old processor, and ios 9 was obviously optimized for the 6s which can handle it very well... but the 4s just isn't powerful enoughThen why push updates for the phone? It's powerful enough to handle iOS 9... Just not well... I have an ipod 4th gen and it runs like shit... It used to be able to run games like Infinity BladeThey have been doing this since the first iphone. I remember this happening to my 3gs. They know what they are doing. This lawsuit is as dumb as a PC user suing Microsoft because Windows 10 doesn't run as well on their Pentium 4 as Windows XP did. I'm sorry, but the iPhone 4 and 4s were the last two old tech phones before ALL mobile CPUs (not just Apple's) processing power began scaling exponentially, rather than linearly. The iPhone 5 is also long in the tooth, though significantly less so than the iPhone 4s due to its old CPU architecture."
"Technology evolves, as do operating systems. Could Apple do better by maintaining a signed downgrade version of each previous iOS? Absolutely, but then we'd have the mishmash fragmentation and security holes of vendor-styled Android. What if someone finds a vulnerability in iOS8? Should Apple be obligated to patch it just because some folks are holding out on obsolete equipment? We're talking about a handset that is five years old, yet still receives modern OS updates. The only other phones I know getting the same treatment are some Galaxy or Nexus devices, but even then it's a scattershot of features, compatibility, and available versions."
"Yes, the mobile OS marketplace leaves a lot to be desired. Yes, Apple could do better at ensuring the speed of older devices over time. Then again, so could Android and Microsoft. Even so, this is a bullshit excuse for a lawsuit. The OS may not be as zippy, but it's at least up to date and doesn't hamper core functionality. If you really dislike it, then just stop upgrading willy-nilly, and consider this a hard lesson in how IT works."
"Ugh, some people just demand to be special little snowflakes. You bought a proprietary device five years ago with zero open sourcing, that is still supported by the manufacturer despite you having given them zero money since."
"Cry more, or hop to an open source device. Spoiler alert, even they're not supported forever.This statement doesn't make any sense. I have an iPhone 5, which is kinda dated but still a pretty recent phone, and it got a ton slower with the new iOS 9 update, it's insane. iOS 8 was super smooth and fast, then from one day to another *poof* it's slow as hell. That's unacceptable, especially since the 'features' that came with it aren't that special either. It's not like the iPhone 5 is antique..."
"Same thing happened to my old iPad 2, iOS 7 was incredibly smooth, then iOS 8 came along and turned my awesome iPad into a slow, sluggish, laggy device.Windows 10 doesn't prevent your computer from downgrading if you don't like it.  Microsoft is still releasing updates for Windows 7."
"Apple does not update iOS 8 for all devices and doesn't let you roll back to it."
"So this lawsuit is nothing like suing Microsoft for Windows 10."
"Yes Apple should be obligated to patch their software on old devices, if they choose to lock down what software can be installed.  If they want to unlock the hardware and let me run a third party os, it might be different.7?  Hell, Windows is still supplying security updates for Vista, and will do so until 2017.Purposely outdating hardware with software is a great way to sell new phonesHavent they been doing this for awhile? It took this long for people to catch on?iOS 9 on the 4S was worse than normal. It's been clear that they've been using iOS upgrades to encourage planned obsolescence for years, but this particular time was worse than in the past and hit a tipping point. This is the reason I won't let my family buy apple devices.  I will not support them.  "
"They lock updates so you can not downgrade.  To install a fresh OS on a device, iTunes needs to connect to the apple servers and request a signature for your device.  If apple isn't signing the version you want to install, too bad for you.  "
"Sure you can jailbreak and save your signatures for each version.  But you can also not do that and just buy from another vendor.  "
"Fuck apple.  My wife upgraded to a 6s for this exact reason.Umm... Assuming it was intentional isn't that the outcome they are looking for? Imagine if after 3-4 years, a car company put an update on your automobile's computer that made it slower, or perform worse.Actually several parts on automobiles are engineered to fail at some point (in order to prevent worse failures). example: Head gaskets eventually leaking/blowing so your engine block doesn't. Now if you don't fix it...There is not a single vehicle with head gaskets designed to fail.  Head gasket failure can destroy an engine.An optional upgrade that you agreed to.They lock you out of putting gas into your car because you didn't upgrade though.This an analogy to something Apple locks you out of because I can't think of what it is?How is apple doing that? Terrible analogy.App store doesn't work as well, YouTube and search engines slow down and crash more. Everything there is an update you lose a huge portion of your storage. Nobody is forcing you to update, though.I shouldn't have to skip on updates with a new phone model that is less than 2 years old because apple slowly forces people to buy new phones. Previous 5c owner.The 5c is 2 years and 3 months old and is commonly looked at as a 'low end' iPhone - not for power users.Just because your favourite app doesn't support lower iOS version than latest. That's on the app dev.Not really. Apple makes it really hard to develop for older versions of iOS since the simulator that ships with Xcode usually only supports 2 versions (I.e. The Xcode 7 series simulator can only run iOS 8 and 9.)"
"Also you can't run the iOS 7 simulator on El Capitan, no matter what version of Xcode you haveWhat? What has Apple kept straight up kept out of the hands of customers who don't immediately upgrade? That's like saying your phone won't charge without an upgrade that doesn't make any sense, man. Not sure if you know this but if your iPhone is eligible for one of these updates, it gives you a pop-up menu asking you to update every couple days. It's optional but Apple does everything they can to make you update except lock you out of your phone.Then you purchase a new car... But by a different company in hopes this one doesn't do the same thing as the last one.Comon man, don't give them any ideas.That's coming eventually.That would probably be sued to hell and back, since cars have a minimum expected life of 7-10 years, often more if maintained properly. What about my iPad 1 with 5.1? It's total shit!I'm pretty sure they can pay this lawsuit with the loose change you find under the cushions of any given couch on Apple headquarters They've done this to every phone for yearsI had an iphone 4 when they release IOs 8 and all of a sudden my device was so slow that hurted! Back in those days i felt that apple was screwing the users up! There is no reason to upgrade an Iphone if still works flawlessly! They new this because the Ipad where so good they lasted 4\5 years no reason to upgrade As someone who just *finally* upgraded to an iPhone 6S from an iPhone 4S, ***fuck iOS 9 on iPhone 4S.***"
"Fucking *atrocious*.My IPAD 2 works like shit now after an IOS upgrade around a year ago.. Battery life cut in half and opening and closing apps is incredibly slow..  Why provide me with an update that makes my IPAD not even worth using anymore?"
"I have never supported apple and thankfully got this device for free.  I did change my mind about hating them 100% to 90%, and was honestly going to continue to buy Ipad only products as I enjoyed it while the experience was good.  Now that they do this to their devices its time to get Surface Pro or Android Tablet that later on can always turn into a lightweight linux distro once support is gone for that device.Yeah, my 4S runs like garbage now and the battery life is a joke.  Never had any complaints about it until I needed to download a newer OS since apps wouldn't work with the older OS any longer.  I kind of feel like I was in a catch 22 where I had to choose between not being able to access multiple apps or get an updated OS.  Overall, I am no longer happy with how my device works now and I would at least like the option to revert to an older OS.Same here.  My gen 2 Ipad is slow as fuck just doing basic shit. And I'll be goddamned if I'll buy a new one seeing how the updates slow their shit down.Any chance this extends to the iPad 2?it extends to all apple products. With every update when I owned the Iphone 5c the phone was slower and slower. My Ipad gen 1 was unusable every time you tried to search google, play you tube or even search the apple store it would crash after 10 seconds. i have a 4S. there is no allegedly about it. the worst thing is... you cant go backwards.Just the 4s?  The past two times they've release a new model phone, my previous gen phone has been laden with problems and issue and obviously slower than it was prior."
"Throw stones at me if you must, but I still love apple.  I'm just saying there's been some shady stuff going on to the previous models for awhile now when their newest phones drop.I have an first generation iPad that used to work just fine."
"I started my own business and opened an account with bank of america.  When i tried to download the app, i got a message saying i had to upgrade my operating system."
"What a huge fucking mistake!"
"Ever since then, it freezes, crashes, reboots all by itself, and is generally a pain in the ass."
"And it never could play youtube videos from the website-it only plays them from the little box below a reddit entry.The iPad 1 came out 6 years ago. You can't seriously expect developers to keep underpowering their apps for a 6 year old device, it's a lifetime in the tech world."
"Well they might warn people that an ugrade will effectively destroy the error free performance of earlier models, which they don't do."
"If I saw a warning to that effect before I overwrote the original OS, I assure you I would have thought twice."
"The average car on the road is eleven and a half years old.  Not all that long ago, in the scheme of things, it was half that."
"I am 62- the concept of a sleek, six hundred dollar device being outdated in a couple of years does not square with my value system."
"Nor, I respectfully submit, should it.Who cares about how old the iPad is?  It worked before the update just fine for this guy and if he just didn't update there wouldn't have been a problem.  If he wanted the newest apps he could have chosen to buy a new device with hardware that can support it, not be forced into it because he accidentally updated. Like we do for browser support? Its not the app developers. I dont care how old the device is honestly, if there is a user base, apps/products will be developed."
"The only reason that doesnt happen in the iOS ecosystem is because apple doesnt want users continuing to use older devices, they want them to buy new devices.It's not a matter of performance really. Apple actively pushes developers to develop for the newer platforms via deprecation. And this has ALWAYS been the Apple way. Yup, their dev tools only let you compile for the latest two iOS versions.It goes a lot deeper as it's not just the 4s as iPad 1 and 2 suffer just as bad from iOS 9. I updated to iOS 9 because an app I used frequently required iOS 8 for an update. Since 8 is no longer available I had to go to 9. According to one of the developers of the app, nothing in the update required iOS 8 but in order for Apple to approve the update to be posted to the App Store, they were forced to flag it to have an iOS 8 requirement even though it would run just fine on iOS 5."
"There's no doubt in my mind this is intentional as there was a time when Apple restricted what version of iOS could be loaded on a device. At some point they realized this was costing them money and could slow down people's devices tricking them into thinking thier hardware was worn out.Oh, your iPad 1 doesn't take iOS 9 well? That's weird, considering the max is 5.1.1 on that one.Wonder how many upgraded to an Iphone 6 instead, probably more than $5m worth.A few years ago iOS 5 did the same thing to my iPhone 4. Makes sense to me that they do this on purpose so you'll upgrade, is that really worth a lawsuit?How has Apple violated any laws? If customers don't like it, switch to a different phone manufacturer. I think the problem is they tell people to update and make the device worse.  "
"If it was an update people had to go search for instead of being prompted, they probably wouldn't have a case.This definitely happened. I had iOS 6 up until a couple weeks ago and my phone worked fine.  I couldn't upgrade to 7 because it was too big.  I recently realized that iOS 9 was small so I did the upgrade and now my phone freezes all the time.A whole five! All phones succumb to this.."
"If they didnt I would still be using my Nexus SAndroids are way more resilient than Apple devices. My Note 1 was ridiculously slow but after a few months of tweaking it's good as new. Just gotta find alternatives and root as well as remove bloatware/unneeded processes and applications.This is nothing new, same thing happens with every gen of an older iphoneI have a 4s with iOS 9.2 and I haven't noticed any real difference.oh wow. 5 million.ITT: People thinking they have a law degreeIs the 4 and earlier just assumed dead now?The 4 didn't get iOS 8, so for all intents and purposes, it's dead.I think Samsung did a similar thing with their Lollipop version. Ever since I got the update, my Galaxy S4 has been buggy as shit. The wifi takes ages to turn on, for example. Should be 1000 times thatWhere will the $5 million go? To the owners of iPhone 4s?My iPad crashed while reading that article.5 million dollars? I think that's fuck you money for them. No biggie, right?This isn't new. As someone that had a 3G and, later, a 4, I always felt that after 2 generations things just didn't work as well. That's it?!I'm with you. Cynical, but with you.Except Google does the opposite? The latest version of Android has loads of optimization improvements that benefit newer and older phones. They still release updates for the Nexus 4 and it doesn't have the same issues like the 4S does with iOS 9. Nexus 4 officially gets security updates only now (even then still pretty good FWIW), you'd need to resort to a custom ROM based on Marshmallow to get it. Even then said ROMs apparently run quite well, and in memory management [it can take on many of today's flagships](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJa_4sj5To00).Oh no ... however will they afford this??$5 mill? Seems like a cheap way to give apple's junior lawyers some practiceReason why I never updated my phone. thats nothing for Apple, the attorneys will prolly make tons of money, and I will get a letter in the mail telling me I am eligible to get a check for $8.03 compensationIt's just so fucking incredible... Now we just need to hit them with a lawsuit for the original iPhone 4 power button crapped out constantly.  The only good thing about it was that my next phone wasn't from Apple.Why are they being sued for this *now*? They did the same thing to the iPhone 4 with the launch of iOS 7."
"I guess the difference is that they eventually fixed\* the problems with an OS update."
"\* - they didn't actually fix itI have an iphone 4 to this now. I cant even use fb messenger without wating for a minute. IOS8iPhone 4 did not support higher then 7.1.2I'm more surprised that people are only just realising Apple's terrible business practices."
"They've been doing this for years...This is standard apple protocol.  They've been gimping older devices with software updates since the beginning.  That's why you don't update an iPhone after two years into its lifecycle.  Never ever.  "
"My 4s was fine now my 3GS got slowed down to unimaginable speeds - where's my lawsuit? Show me the mooooneyFor you armchair lawyers out there, this isn't necessarily a $5 million lawsuit.  28 U.S.C. SS 1332(d) requires that for a federal district court to have jurisdiction over a class action, the amount in controversy must be at least $5 million, exclusive of interest and costs.  So that's what is pled in the complaint.  It's a minimum amount, not an estimation of actual damages.Google destroyed the nexus 4 and nothing came of it. Microsoft ruins computers all the time. I think it is just accepted as an inherent risk of accepting the update. Microsoft does, however, offer the option of rolling back. Apple currently doesn't provide for that, which is specifically identified in the court filing.Apple made $5m in the time it took you to read the headline.Sorry who is actually affected by this? Suing something for the sake of making money or what? This is definitely a problem only Apple will face. No one is going to complain that Android Marshmallow doesn't work on Android phones from 5 years ago.5 mil is not even pocket money for Apple.5 mil lolShitty apple, stop being a Jackass.Jokes aside I think $5 million is a lot more optimistic than anything more for some sort of reparations."
"We all know how stuck-up Apple can be when they're being sued, and so this seems like a way of actually winning.As someone with an iPhone 4, is there any way to support this? When I was working tech support for Apple, if a client started the call with the sentence I recently updated... you just knew that shit was fucked up. Reminds me of when everyones wifi would gray out right after one iOS update. People want an explanation, and you have to throw some mumbo jumbo out and hope they don't call you on it, cause you have no fucking clue why any of this is happening.Apple should just let users revert to a previous IOS version if newest causes issues for older phones.  Have a waiver that states they are not responsible for any issues this might cause. Can you speed up an iOS9ed 4S by jail breaking it and Cydia?Thanks for the warning! This is why I always wait at least 6 months before updating software.I had an iPhone 5 that worked perfectly until iOS 9. After updating it the device lost battery life. Each update made a small dent and then the last one caused my phone to run out of battery in 25 minutes without use and never turn on again.Spoiler Alert:"
"Apple products are defective by design.Spoiler Alert: Your 4+ year old mobile device will feel slower after the latest update which includes even more features & background services."
"How does KitKat, Lollipop, or Marshmallow run on a Samsung Galaxy S2? Oh wait it doesn't (without custom ROMs).Really? I like my iPhone 6s very much and it works just fine, thank you very much.My 4s runs dead slow and this was something I suspected Apple of doing as my Wife's 3 runs like lightning as she refuses to install the updates.  This has led me to want to upgrade, but to an Android phone instead as there is no reason for Google to do this.Go to Android man. You won't regret it.Android user here. This. You won't even get updates for that long so it won't be an issue. If the people cared how fast their phone was, they wouldn't be buying an iphone in the first place.iPhones are extremely fast out of the box. The Anti-Apple circlejerk needs to get its shit together. The A9 processor is fucking magical in the 6S. Even the A7 with iOS 9 on my iPhone 5 is completely usable. If not my word, there's always MKBHD. A well-known tech reviewer who clearly favors Google/Android, yet even he is able to admit the iPhone is one of the fastest phones on the market.it depends on what fast means in this instance. The A9 is a beast, but android as an OS feels much faster with faster animations and all 60fps. To me, Android feels faster, no matter how fast the iphone hardware is.So is the top of the line Android device, although you are right in criticising the user for using the speed argument. Top of the line any brand will zip along great on purchase.Good luck proving that planned obsolescence equals fraud.I hope they lose for the principle of the matter (seriously, Apple gets away with *far* too much shit), but 5 million is a joke.$5 million.. heh.  I bet they'll spend more defending it.  Can't let a precedent be set. So the class will get a $20 rebate on a new iPhone?Ooooooo"
"-AppleWell I guess my decision not to update past 8.5 was a good one. I have a 4s.  How do I get in on this action?I don't blame them.  I had a 4S and the recent iOS updates made the phone impossible to use.  I'd click on something and it would lag, take way too long to open and often would crash.  Messages would just disappear and it would take several restarts to get things back to normal.  The phone turned to complete shit to the point where I pretty much had to upgrade which cost me more because I have a grandfathered-in unlimited data plan and had to buy a refurbished iPhone 6.I'll say it again: iOS 6 was the last good iOS. Afterwards, QC is in freefall."
"Get Scott Forstall back and coax Bertrand Serlet into returning and Apple's golden again.but would that not make all apps look like cowgirl pants again ?I'll take Scott Forstall shitting out faux leather any day if it meant people got a relatively stable OS.My Nexus 7 from 2012 was reduced to function as an alarm clock because Android 5 sucked all the juice out of it. The iPad 3 from 2012 is still chugging along even with the latest updates. Yeah I know I can revert to older versions on Android but that's not really an average customer option. So it is not just an Apple issue."
"The best strategy for Apple customers is: buy a new device and sell it when it is 2-3 years old. The money you will get for an used Apple device is quite high and so you can invest in a new one. Everyone is complaining about the high prices of Apple devices but just compare the prices of an used Apple device to let's say an Samsung device; Samsung S4 vs IPhone 5S both from 2013. An used 5S is almost EUR100 more expensive. "
"The iPad 3 is absolute dogshit ever since iOS 8. It's almost unusable even with 9.2.I guess it depends on how you use it. My wife used it for Internet and a few low profile games. We sold it and she has an Air now but we did not feel it was slow. This doesn't just happen on iPhones, I just upgraded my Mac to El Capitan and it's pretty much unusable. "
"It took 10 minutes to empty the trash, it's even struggling as I type this!!"
"It just makes me not want to upgrade my mac but I fear that many do and the whole cycle repeats.Hey Apple Fans, skip this thread your in for a bad read."
"But that's just r/technology I call bullshit, old hardware can't handle new software as well, get over itDoes this mean i can sue Rockstar for selling me a game that makes my computer run slower than say someones I7 Skylake CPU computer?  "
"Or can i sue Dell for filling my computer with windows 10 bloatware slowing it down compared to my 2005 Dell computer?  "
"Please let me reference this case in court to gain millions to build myself the ULTIMATE GAMING MACHINE. ^^^^ps4 *Cough*Non-American here. Can someone please explain how can you sue a company because you use their products? It's not like they're selling vaccuum cleaners that explode and leave you in a wheelchair. It's a phone that's a little bit slower than it used to be."
"Stop using iPhones. Get a new one. That'll hurt Apple more than some dinky $5 million lawsuit. Or does the average person really not have that kind of willpower?"
"Sorry, this just pisses me off. It just seems like such a whiny, baby move to do. >Stop using iPhones. Get a new one."
"Let's see how many people would be willing to do this.Suing companies over small, trivial matters is the American Dream(tm).Can I have your phone?  If it's so easy to just get a new phone, just give me yours.  Thanks.> It's a phone that's a little bit slower "
"It's a phone that's a ~~little bit~~ lot slower This is what pushed me to get a Galaxy S6. "
"Best. Decision. Ever.Give it a year lmaoPlanned obsolescence isn't just an apple thing. If you look back to the Galaxy s3, you can't even get updates. They just drop support for your phoneNot really, my old S3 works just fine (I bought it used, now have an LG g3, but gave  my brother my S3 because there's nothing wrong with it).  7,000mah battery thrown in, can easily do 4-7 days per charge, which is longer than any smartphone you can buy that I'm aware of.What does a battery have to do with anything?Whether or not the phone can be powered on or used at all?  It's literally what powers the device.Apple should burn in hell.  The company is a scam.Tell the truth on Reddit and get down voted. Gave you an up vote for not giving a fuck.will it be a class action? my mums 4s is affected by thisIf you're really that hard-up for $3.50 in sweet, sweet class-action rewards, just PM me your PayPal and save yourself the heartache of waiting six months for the case to eventually get dismissed and no rewards being distributed.ahh is that all, im not american, i know little to nothing about suingYeah, class-action lawsuits like this are very lame. It's not a typical lawsuit where somebody takes somebody else to court. Instead, a group of lawyers takes the company to court. If they win, the company being sued provides large sum of money. MOST of that money will just go to the lawyers who worked the case. The remaining, small portion, goes to the actual victims of whatever they're suing for. And the way it's distributed is that the victims have to find out about the lawsuit somehow - usually the company who lost the suit will provide the lawyers a list of customers who bought the product in question, and send them a letter telling them they're eligible for a reward. Then after everybody enrolls into the rewards, the remaining money (after the lawyers take the majority of it) is distributed equally among everybody else. But because there's often hundreds of thousands of people in there, there's hardly any money given out to each individual person. More often than not, just a few bucks. "
"I've taken part in a couple class-action suits. Most of the time, I got less than $10. One time I actually got somewhere around $40, which was nice, but very rarely did the check come up to anything worth the gas it would take to drive to the bank and cash it.The last class action lawsuit I signed up for took 10 minutes and netted me $20 about six months down the line.This doesn't just apply to the 4S either. I have a 6S plus and it ran sluggishly up until iOS 9.2 was released. iOS 9 has just been a train wreck in general. It's a rushed and incomplete operating system that should have been much more heavily optimized prior to release.Sorry to be the one to burst your bubble on this, but every software upon launch has had some sort of release issue. It's nothing new, the main thing is that the engineering team at Apple actually listens to feedback and fixes things in a pretty quick fashion. Hence why the company has evolved the way it has. Not saying that iOS is perfect, because it definitely isn't, but i'd take it over any other smart phone software nowadays for its simplicity, elegance and easy of troubleshooting.People do realize it's a 5 year old phone right? The newest software is designed around the newest processors. The newer processors handle information better."
"How is this news. This is literallY part of every piece of software/OS ever designed."
"I swear. These comments are either from grandparents or tech idiots.iOS 9 is advertised as being an upgrade.  Clearly from your comments you either didn't understand or didn't read the article.[deleted]The lawsuit is because Apple includes no downgrade option. So anyone who upgrades is stuck with a slow ass phone.can you not backup, restore to factory and upgrade to ios 8?As a user of the iPhone 4S, I knew Apple would eventually pull shit like that. My 10 year old PC runs Windows 7 slowly. Should we sue Microsoft?Were you forced to update?Exactly my point."
"I didn't have to update. Having new software run slow on old systems is sort of expected. "
"You aren't forced to update to the new iOS. So people saying iOS 9 runs slow on their 4S...well, duh of course it will. It's slower hardware trying to run new software with all sorts of new features.Well, you aren't forced to, but you lose functionality until you do as apps refuse to work without updating.  That loss of functionality should not occur if they say they aren't going to require updates because, for certain apps, they most certainly do.But if I have app version 1.1 and it works great in iOS8...don't update the app then?Updates for apps are often seen as synonymous with greater functionality.  If I don't see any indication that the updated app would no longer work with my current iOS version (which I should before updating), then why wouldn't I update it?  I understand that things might not work the best on my older iPhone, but if it straight up isn't going to work with my iOS, then I should know that before updating it.I agree but I don't think that's Apple's issue if an app gets updated and loses functionality in the old iOS? That's all I'm saying."
"Basically if you don't update your apps (for a newer iOS) and use the iOS that comes with your phone, you shouldn't have any problems?Perhaps it isn't their issue, but somewhere along the line there should be warning about compatibility (if necessary) and the option roll back the iOS or app version if a user wants to.  Whether that responsibility falls on the shoulders of the app developers or Apple is of no consequence to me, the end user.  I just want to see one of them step up and do it to improve the experience.  I believe Apple should have an interest in doing so since people often attribute lost functionality with a device, not the programs used with the device (at least initially).I think that sounds like a really good idea - a class action lawsuit though doesn't make sense.Well, yeah, everyone does planned obsolescence; if every company that did this was also fined no one would want to have anything to do with smartphone manufacturing.>Well, yeah, everyone does planned obsolescence;..."
"But the lawsuit filing seems to go beyond that and is alleging ~~what borders on~~ sabotage for intentionally degrading performance with no option to roll back to a better performing, fully compatible OS in an attempt to coerce owners of their old iPhones to upgrade where they might not have felt the need to do so, otherwise. If what the plaintiffs allege is true, it would mean that instead of Apple incentivizing upgrades via the offering of more features and inherently superior performance, a more robust OS, Apple is essentially extorting its customers to upgrade by breaking their current iPhones. That's like Bridgestone hammering nails into your car's otherwise functional tires and saying that you need to upgrade to their newest tires. Based on what the lawsuit is alleging, if Apple was being honest, it would simply not have the option of upgrading to the newer OS for owners of their previous iPhones, or warning of the negative consequences for upgrading and/or allowing a rollback to the previous OS. I keep seeing this crap about planned obsolescence, but this is the exact same thing people deal with with older computers. "
"You have an old phone. To use newer software that taxes a system a lot more, you have to update the operating system to an OS that, in turn, will tax your system as well."
"These are the same fucking people that complain that they CAN'T update to the latest iOS version because their phone is too old; either way, Apple is somehow trying to force them to buy newer hardware. "
"Do me a favor -- go buy one of the cheaper and earlier Windows 7 computers, get the Windows 10 upgrade, and let me know how it runs for you."
"Jesus Christ, some of yall are worse than my grandparents, thinking their old tube TV should be able to play Blu-Ray movies.>These are the same fucking people that complain that they CAN'T update to the latest iOS version because their phone is too old; either way, Apple is somehow trying to force them to buy newer hardware."
"They haven't put iOS restrictions on devices for quite a while now which is why we have this problem. Much like every other aspect in life I'd be willing to bet it was a vocal minority that complained they couldn't upgrade their device to the latest version. When Apple prevented devices of a certain age from progressing further in the iOS version, they weren't bricking said devices. They were simply saying if you want access to the latest features you need the latest hardware. Now with no restrictions in place they are forcing you to upgrade because devices are being rendered unusable since once the update is applied there is no way to revert. They even go so far as to entice the user into upgrading when everytime you close an app, end a call, change a setting, etc...you are prompted with a notice informing you an upgrade is available and the process is just a couple of clicks from starting. "
">Do me a favor -- go buy one of the cheaper and earlier Windows 7 computers, get the Windows 10 upgrade, and let me know how it runs for you."
"My mother has a very generic Asus from '10 and she accidentally went through the Win10 upgrade process and after I clean installed, it has 0 issues. I think this is great. I love when apple gets sued.thats why you jailbreak. Been runnin 7.1.1 since I got my iphone.Own a 4S is it was so damn slow from this."
"I broke ties and now Samsung Galaxy Note 4, couldn't be happier. (just a little big in the pocket)So your phone from 2011 was slow so you switched to a phone from 2014 and it's faster? Wow! What a surprise! The real question should be why are people still using the 4 or the 4S?ITT people who think batteries don't deplete over time, and that much more advanced software shouldn't use more power."
"If your iPhone is over 3 years old, the battery will likely need to be replaced soon. Call AppleCare and ask to get a free diagnostic done on it.Apple makes $5 million in 0.00001 second. lol funny.. same people went on and on about how apple updates all its phones.. this is why samsung htc and others dont update all their phones.You realize that people who use cell phones expand outside of the western culture right? Many cell devices run just fine on older operating systems. This is an issue because of how ios ecosystem works. Everyone who uses the iphone can't necessarily own the newest device but may enjoy the operating system. If Apple is truly slowing down devices they are really only hurting themselves in developing countries which is where they were wanting to expand. This is why android continues to grow with such speed in that area. Apple just makes such bad decisions these days. This is not what Steve had in mind. It's never been the apple way to try to dominate the market share. They don't need to be winning on that front to maximize profit.The iPhone isn't a product targeting developing countries. The only phone that Apple sells is an expensive, high-end device.Just a few in here placing the monetary value of the lawsuit above the principle of it...I've been saying this for years with each damn upgrade.  They deliberately slow down the older phones to make people feel as if the new ones are more 'powerful' than they actually are.   iPhone 6+ 16gb user here. My phone is so slow I wanna kill myself and Louis C.K. would make fun of me.That's from only one update?  Does that mean ALL updates will slow the phone down?That's why I upgraded. I hope Apple loses.Was apple contractually obligated in any way to continue supporting and optimizing new software for old devices? Shit.. My phone 5 years ago was an HTC Aria. If I expected ATT/HTC to provide me updates at all, let alone ones that run well today, I'd be called a lunatic.I would expect essential security patches for 10 years.  They should be forced to do that by law.It's been slowing down phones since iOS 8, it was frustrating as hell to use my 4 with iOS 8. My girlfriend is now having this problem with iOS 9 on her iPhone 5. It's not just 9 on the 4's.Lol meanwhile Quentin Tarantino is being sued for $100 million dollars for allegedly stealing the idea for Django. Hey my iPhone 4 is terrible. Where is my moneyOh no! 5 million! What is the business with the largest market cap in history going to do?!Allegedly?  They've been doing this every fucking generation, it's widely acknowledge and easily proven."
"That's like accusing porn of helping people masturbate.  No fucking shit.  xDIf it's so easily proven, then please do so. Don't be goddamned stupid :-(."
"My iPhone 3G got stuck on iOS 4, I could not upgrade it any further. The idea that you're going to update the 4S to iOS 9 is highly doubtful. It should actually tell you which system support which phone.What the fuck are you on about?unupdatable platforms.Next they'll be sued for using more memory in the device... or needing more power to fully charge, or more time to fully charge... or costing more... or having slow access at the App store on-line... or longer waits at the real Apple stores... or for NOT having features that someone else has...Nah that last one would've happened by now.  We should have been lawyers...Having just spent over $500 to replace the catalytic converter in my car I'll go in a different direction and say we should've taken Vo-Tech for Auto Shop in High School.

Sure Apple most definitely gave the NSA a backdoor into my phone, but no smartphone can be made truly anonymous. It's the update itself that I knew was trouble as soon as I heard about it.but you bought their phone to begin with?It was the best available option for what I wanted. When they talked about iOS9 making Siri smarter and proactive and integrating it into every aspect of your life, I knew it was a huge privacy risk. Now in addition to that, I find out that Apple used it to artificially make older devices obsolete.So...

">>A portion of a 1789 law signed by George Washington requires Apple Inc. to help decrypt information on smartphones and tablets marketed as protected against government intrusion, the feds say."
"He argued:"
"1) The 1789 law was not actually being used"
"2) The order was *not* to help decrypt information, but a) help them get past the lock screen b) provide a copy of the encrypted information (again, no requirement to help decrypt, which is in direct conflict with the article's assertion). "
"The topic there was whether or not the Feds were using a 1789 law to require assistance in decrypting, as claimed by the author. "

"I also want to let people know that Apple has a [Security White Paper](https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf) which they update regularly, that describes *in detail* how they secure the data on your iOS device and in transit and in iCloud."
"The first part about iMessage:"
"-----------"
"iMessage makes extensive use of the Apple Push Notification service (APNs). Apple does not log messages or attachments, and their contents are protected by end-to-end encryption so no one but the sender and receiver can access them. Apple cannot decrypt the data.  "
"When a user turns on iMessage on a device, the device generates two pairs of keys for use with the service: an RSA 1280-bit key for encryption and an ECDSA 256-bit key on the NIST P-256 curve for signing. The private keys for both key pairs are saved in the device's keychain and the public keys are sent to Apple's directory service (IDS), where they are associated with the user's phone number or email address, along with the device's APNs address.  "
"As users enable additional devices for use with iMessage, their encryption and signing public keys, APNs addresses, and associated phone numbers are added to the directory service. Users can also add more email addresses, which will be verified by sending a confirmation link. Phone numbers are verified by the carrier network and SIM. Further, "
"all of the user's registered devices display an alert message when a new device, phone number, or email address is added."
"------------Hey. Apple turns over everything already. "
"No shit"
"http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/2o5jo4/udickwhiskey_destroys_a_clickbait_article_by/That actually discusses how iOS8 is designed to make complying with such orders an `unreasonable technical burden` for the company. They can't bypass lock screens, they can't decrypt messages on the fly. Their company has set up their infrastructure so that they are no longer the Fed's fallguy for breaking into user's data/communications. "
"That doesn't mean the Feds can't do it, it just means they can't claim that Apple has to do it for them in a context where the evidence can be introduced to a public prosecution.Do both parties need to have the app installed for security to take affect? That's how it usually works with these sorts of systems.> iMessage makes extensive use of the Apple Push Notification service (APNs). Apple does not log messages or attachments, and their contents are protected by end-to-end encryption so no one but the sender and receiver can access them. Apple cannot decrypt the data."
"Does it matter since phone companies already log all messages, and have backdoors?  Doesn't matter if it's secure in the middle if it's open season on both ends."
"You say et cetera, but I don't see it anywhere for Windows phone.Your positive comment falls apart at this part of the article unfortunately.  Making it a problem for both Apple and Signal."
">  The obvious flaw in this system is that the government could potentially force Apple to add an additional public key to your account, which would be analogous to registering an extra device, said cryptography expert Matthew Green in an email. Now everyone who sends you a message will be unknowingly encrypting an additional copy of the message to this new 'ghost device.' If the government runs that device, they can tap your messages."
">Simply put: Apple could be forced to allow the FBI to impersonate an iPhone user, which would in effect allow the agency to siphon off a suspect's messages as they come in."
">Green added that services like WhatsApp and Signal are also vulnerable to similar attacks.Signal has actually been designed to make it durable against the attack!"
"Every Signal user can see their key fingerprint and share it with others through another channel, and can verify the key fingerprint of other people when communication is established. This way, they can confirm that the key server didn't swap out keys, making it simply a distribution point and not a trusted exchange channel."
"With iMessage, there is no way for you, as an enduser, to get your key's fingerprint or the fingerprints of the other party's keys, to perform this kind of independent audit."
"This *does* mean you have to perform a little extra verification that isn't automatic."
"As for WhatsApp -- it apparently had some other weaknesses from rolling their own crypto, or something that made their implementation flawed. Don't know, briefly scanned over it, don't use it.Thanks for the reply, Still have to look into Signal, only times I have heard of it were in the comment and when I saw it mentioned in the article.> available for iOS, Android, etcetera"
"Got my hopes up there, it's only iOS and Android. :(> ...their contents are protected by end-to-end encryption so no one but the sender and receiver can access them. Apple cannot decrypt the data."
"[This is a lie. Apple has full control over this public key directory,](http://www.macworld.com/article/2055640/researchers-challenge-apples-claim-of-unbreakable-imessage-encryption.html)"
"Moxie Marlinspike, who was quoted in that story about the public key directory vulnerability, is the lead developer of OpenWhisperSystems, and developed it to make the key signatures auditable and durable. With Signal, if you both have each other's key signatures, you can tell if the key server has swapped out keys. It means the key server is a distribution method that doesn't have to be trusted; it still leaves the problem of needing a way to exchange key signatures that you trust.Doesn't matter, firmware and hardware is compromised at the factory so any software after that is compromised, no matter how good it is."
"The only way to beat a compromised system is to develop a new language that only you and the recipient know."
"The chair is against the wall can mean anything."
"Windows Phone?why oh why did i get a windows phone.."
"Because it was only $40? I still like mine.People love to hate Apple, but their devices are relatively secure, and they're taking a stance and speaking up about it.As much as I like the idea of what you say, let's not forget that 99+% of information the government obtains (illegally or otherwise) is guarded by a gag, so whenever the government gets data, you WONT hear about it."
"It's just in these somewhat fringe cases where the company got to say no."
"There's a big difference between going to a company or carrier with a court order, and just leave the back door open, we'll let ourselves in...When did Apple switch from EdDSA and Ed25519 for signing?

"Isn't the software security moot if the phones themselves have built in backdoors in the hardware?

"
"If you're conversing with one or more endpoints outside the United States, no warrant is needed and you simply have to rely on whether the US Department of State feels the need to go to the trouble to assign an analyst to you and possibly tip their hand by triggering a network intrusion detection on the eavesdropping traffic.> the government must acquire a warrant from a domestic, non-FISA court to use any possible backdoor into your device to eavesdrop your messages there. "
"No they don't, it's just if they acquire data in an illegal manner it's inadmissible in court."
"What they do is build their case upon other supporting evidence that they do get legally based upon the information they get illegally."
"They always can use a straw man, a anonymous source that provides vital details if they can't do that."
"The problem is the jury hears the illegal evidence as the prosecutor gets to go first and the defense can object if they can prove the information was gained illegally and thus inadmissible, but that's difficult to prove. Even if proven, the jury still heard the illegal information despite being told by a judge to dismiss it."
"Trying to find cops who will testify against other cops is hard thing to do, they have a blue code to stick up each others testimony just like criminals do."
"Face it, our hardware is backdoored at the factory and anything in them is never going to be 100% private. Software on top of it isn't going to make a difference if the firmware is recording all the keystrokes.Admissibility is not determined in front of a jury, it is determined before the jury sees the evidence. Just because you're both in the US does not mean your data status on the US... If that packet crossed boarders and back again before reaching its target, you're pretty much screwedBut the packet is encrypted when it leaves your device.I believe he is saying that since some packets left the US (which happens all the time, even for domestic communications) the government no longer needs a warrant to use a backdoor.

"At any rate, it doesn't matter that they can legally spy on US citizens without a warrant. My bigger worry is that, according to Snowden, the NSA isn't held accountable for producing warrants. If an NSA agent wants to snoop on a citizen they can. There are a lot of scary stories that have popped up involving stalkers and sharing stolen nude photos amongst government agents."
"Regardless of if the laws changed recently, the important thing is whether or not government agencies are held to those laws. Unfortunately I still don't think that's the case. Don't forget that they can always have their Five Eyes buddies snoop on us and then get their intel.[removed]> So how long until a Dictator rises and takes control of the three branches of government by force?"
"I'm not certain that that could happen in the US."
"Oh, don't get me wrong, I'm not naive. I understand that as we move toward a system where more and more voting districts use electronic voting machines owned by corporations known to be run by known corrupt individuals, we run the risk of popular vote becoming a meaningless term."
"Combined with that a President could certainly use the tremendous power of the US domestic spying apparatus (that we now openly admit that we have) to leverage Congress to some extent (I don't think you'd ever get the House to play ball, but the Senate you could undermine without too much difficulty)."
"So with the Senate backing a President, and assuming the military didn't eject him forcibly if he tried to use them to shut down the House, the SCOTUS becomes toothless and can be safely ignored."
"But here's where the problem arises. The US is a pretty huge place, and there are many states that will have none of it. Unless the guy who does it is from the South, most of the South will likely leave the union as soon as there really is a dictator and not some imagined they're coming to take my guns scare. The now-dictator could nuke the south and turn it into glass... but that doesn't solve the problem, and creates new ones (and I would expect it to lead to an immediate military coup, possibly before the nukes took flight). We could have another civil war, and the South would ultimately lose, but that would lead to an insurrection that would make Iraq look tame, and we know how well our government fares against insurrections."
"Meanwhile you have the economic situation. That's actually the one place a dictator might not fare too badly in the US, but it would be really hard to strike the right balance. If we descend into internal conflict, something very bad happens: our debt becomes less valuable. At which point, we can't effectively keep borrowing to prop up our massive debt load. We could refuse to repay our debt, but that doesn't end well, as China immediately becomes our economic enemy. No matter what, if our debt becomes junk, we're in for a whopper of a recession (probably a depression on par with the Great Depression) and economic pain always makes it harder for a dictator to maintain control."
"My point is that the US would be very hard to *maintain* a dictatorial control over (and that's partly by design). I think we'd need a real external threat to even make it work for a short while (this is how the Roman Republic fell, as you probably know) but turning that into a sustainable structure... I'm not sure it would be possible."

"I'm not well-versed in the US constitution, but aren't those the reasons why americans have a right to bear arms? The founders of the United States wanted no standing army so the government always had to do the will of the people or it would be overthrown, and when wars occurred wanted the population to join the war effort voluntarily. Due to circumstance (mainly Native American insurgencies) a small standing army was created. This didn't always work out as intended- the US Civil War had to rely on conscription from both sides, for example. Basically, the right to bear arms is in the US Constitution to form a voluntary militia when one was needed because the writers wanted no standing army."
"Proof of this:"
"Article II says this: A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the Right of the People to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed."
"And here's Article I Section 8, Clause 12 on not having a standing army (for long): The Congress shall have Power To ...raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years....Yeah but as a whole I'd like to think the US could find a better solution rather than say a modern-day civil war.Oh haha yes, I hope that as well, not saying they should start one.  "
"I allways thought they had the right to bear arms, to kind of scare their government into not being corrupt/doing dumb stuff like that out of fear for one.I currently live in Texas as a permanent resident so I'm allowed to purchase firearms. Honestly my little AR 15, pistol,  or shotgun won't do shit if our government comes rolling in with fucking tanks....True, I see your point.   "
"So, if I would say that it is more a tradition than a practical(?) right, would I be (very) wrong?I'd say it would be a very good topic for debate. On one hand yes I would say some of it is tradition. Most gun nuts I know are just pure hobbiests and love to blow shit up, plain and simple. On the other hand our right to bare arms was initially instilled in the constitution by the forefathers for the very purpose of having civilian protection from all enemy's foreign and domestic. "
"Edit: It just seems with all the corruption in our government we have alot of domestic enemy's. Shooting them won't be the answer, and I don't believe they are even remotely worried about that. A restructuring of how our democracy works would be a good step in the right direction. Maybe get rid of lobbying and corporations buying our nation's leaders.

"And we crucified the Nazis in Nuremberg for same crimes. Goebbels and Himmler would be laughing now."
"Seriously, I've been copy and pasting this quote all over the internet for the last 15 years. We joke about comparing things to Nazis online, but seriously."
"There was a psychologist interviewing many of the prisoners at Nuremberg. This is an excerpt of a conversation between that psychologist and Herman Goring, one of the leading Nazi party members. He founded the Gestapo before passing it over to Himmler and was a key player in the early part of the story as the Nazis seized power."
"> **Goring:** Why, of course, the people don't want war. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship.  "
"> **Gilbert:** There is one difference. In a democracy, the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives, and in the United States only Congress can declare wars.  "
"> **Goring:** Oh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger.

"> So how long until a Dictator rises and takes control of the three branches of government by force?"
"Ironically, when this happens, it won't be the sinister forces of the establishment that do this. They're already in control; why would they rock the boat?"
"No, it'll be a charismatic demagogue who's doing it to protect us from Them.It's stunning that every alarm isn't going off for every American when they read secret courts. The government is effectively asking for the right to violate the constitution and spy on every American in a court case that no American can ever see the details of. That is so distinctly un-American. They're literally could not be anything more un-American.Not to mention the secret courts have essentially Supreme Court level power. Yes the Supreme Court can override their decisions, but often they don't even know about the rulings. The president can do the same thing with executive orders, and has, creating organizations like [FEMA](http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/hardtruth/fema_executive_orders.htm), which may even have unconstitutional emergency power to declare martial law if congress is unable.This is how fascism starts. Blind patriotism, fear of outsiders, secret armed police, surveillance.It *started* a long time ago (pre-9/11, but 9/11 put it into hyperdrive).  The only question now is where does it end?"
"When we decide to stop remembering 9/11 as a positive experience.I'm a bit confused by your statement. Never have a met a person who think that the attacks on 9/11 were a positive experience.  We still have people dying to this day because of the events that occurred - be they soldiers who are overseas in a hostile environment in the related war(s), people who were exposed to massive levels of dangerous carcinogens like asbestos from the site of the building collapse, or citizens of other countries being killed by the fighting and ongoing terror.  Hardly positive for anyone involved in my opinion. It gave those wanting to legitimize the mass surveillance an excuse.

So kind of the same way this terrorism thing has been building up huh?In America yes. Indeed, calling this period in American history the terrorist scare wouldn't be out of place at all. Although who knows how seriously the government is in being scared of terrorists. Or are they following Winston Churchill's advice: never waste a good crisis?We're fighting them there so we don't have to fight them here! As if a rag tag group of terrorists could come in on a raft and take on the Coast guard, State and Local Police, National Guard, Armed Citizens ect. and then overthrow the government and institute Sharia Law.

"Haha, yet there are probably plenty of patriots (opportunitists) who still spout this nonsense. "
"It's brought up almost every time I try to have a conversation with someone about ending the constant occupation of other countries and shutting down over seas bases.Perhaps the truth is somewhere in the middle. You really think branding journalist who expose corruption as 'political dissidents,' using the guise of 'terrorism' to allow unfettered and systemic removal of constitutional rights, along with zero accountability for the federal organizations committing these acts, and making everything a 'national security secret' lands somewhere 'in the middle?'

"This is adorable. >crashing down by levying unreasonable and far-reaching financial sanctions"
"The problem with this kind of tough talk is that it signals to Apple to further diversify their talent/offices offshore; even before a single fine/sanction is levied."
"Apple are already used to this line of thinking with their production facilities, and have R&D facilities in a growing number of countries (e.g. Israel and Japan.) They regularly raise bond-based capital in foreign countries so they can continue their offshore diversifications. (Just recently the UK and a few months prior in Australia.)"
"There is also a very real short term issue of sanctioning Apple: It will most harm the USA and harm investors who trade in Apple. (i.e. everyone in the USA with superannuation.)

"A government large enough to give you everything you want is large enough to take everything you have.To be fair, by the people the men who originally made that statement were referring only to wealthy, white, land-owning men such as themselves.Well duh, blacks weren't *people*.  /sI think they may have been a bit divorced from that idea, as they had only recently acquired land and a sense of ownership of that land at the time of the writing of the Declaration of Independence and the gradual rebellion from British rule. This was a document meant to inspire, to relate to, to unify not just the wealthy but also the common folk. The war for independence could not be fought if it was meant only for the wealthy; how then would the American rich be that much different from the British, the Crown? So what? We've done hard work as a nation in the past couple hundred years to redefine and then redefine again what the people means.though you're probably just being facetious, i really recommend you read the writings of the founders. they're surprisingly still relevant and easily understandable. in my opinion, they made pretty clear that they definitely did not mean that.So far, nothing has gotten me this riled up about the US's government. The fact that the government basically has to blackmail companies so that they have complete access to our social lives is absolutely disgusting. The US Constitution states that we all deserve a right to privacy, and yet a company that tries to protect that right is then persecuted by the government. This is just wrong in so many different ways. I'm just left wordless and hope that we come to a conclusion that is right. Last time I checked, the government is comprised of people.  There are many good career actors in government who must be weak to stay there and are easily controlled by the few psychopaths in charge."
"The goal is not to change government but to find a better system to weed out the psychopaths -- perhaps through some blood tests or frontal lobe exams.> Today the people have destroyed all trust that the government had in them; only through doubled workload can this trust be gained back"
"A quote from a soviet republic in 1953, but it very well fits into our society today."
"Shows what ideals are worth.Well, the public doesn't care enough. Most voters won't vote to minimize this, nor do they have a choice really with bipartizan support for this in the US.And therein lies the problem with our modern government.This goes far beyond modern government.Don't the people overthrow the government for this kind of shit?That's impossible at this point.We can overthrow the government at the polls every few years.  We just don't.No, it isn't."
"It just requires the right kind of leadership."
"That leadership will not be found with any political party or related organization, PAC, etc."
"It has to be grassroots, and politicians must be kept away from it.It still is. Just make a famine. Wrong. It could be done using state's rights. Many states have direct democracy. We could e.g. (in the extreme example) write a bill that says that the California Republic will become independent on January 1, 2018 unless the federal government stops violating the 1st and 4th amendments. I don't think so. Maybe in 10 to 20 years it will be impossible when nanotech becomes developed and the government could just terminate entire swaths of the population instantly. That's why we have to do it now before it's too late.It takes a few military officers who lead a few thousand soldiers to get the dominoes falling, along with popular support. Yea it can be done.Bullshit! Do you know how many American citizens own guns? How about the prospect of convincing military personel to fire on its own people if civilians ever decided to stand up? I really believe it's possible but we've been tied to shackles of debt, thus giving people no time to do anything about it.Why do you think so?Civilians can't possibly win a war against the most over powered military in the history of the world.   What will Billy Bob's  shotgun  do against an A-10 or an Abrams? Found the guy that never did war games during the summer."
"Military would last 6 weeks, tops. This kind of statement arises frequently in discussions like this.  You have to provide logistics for both of those things to work effectively.  An Abrams/A-10 won't operate too long without massive logistical support.  That logistical behemoth required by the military crumbles when dissent occurs."
"The government stock piles a lot of fuel and ammunition, but it has to have people willing to continue to do so, have supply lines uninterrupted, etc.. "
"Because they're planning for it.  All the laws passed post 9-11 are adaptable to domestic uprisings. Plus the largest military known to mad.  "
"They can shutdown an entire city by turning off the power, cell phones, and gas (they stop the gas stations during hurricanes routinely).   They'll also stop the food from entering any rebellious city if they feel like it."
"They have the power, that's all there is to it.The military is made up of people. If a movement got going, even with only a few million people, they'd back down. "
"Hell, this sub has 5 million ish people. If all 5 million of us were US citizens, and began a (peaceful) protest, a lot of shit would happen. Sure, they may try and disperse people. But according to wikipedia, the Us army is made of around 1.5 million people. Outnumber the military, and they will definitely back down. "
"Now, if all 5 million began revolting, then shit will hit the fan. Remember what happened to the General in Thailand that led the revolt?"
"Can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs. "
"Seriously though, with people able to actually voice their opinions over social media, it wouldn't be impossible to see an uprising succeeding. Even more so when you factor in the fact the military is volenteer in, people may refuse to shoot if it came to that. Even the US isn't that corrupt, yet. If the government goes so far afield that revolution is a serious concern, do you really think all of the members of the military, all of the lower tier government workers are going to keep doing what they've been doing? Do you really think that members of the US military are going to start invading their own country and killing citizens? Yes, the US has a VAST military dominance, but it's not just a bunch of mindless robots. They're all Americans too.There's enough police, Army, Marines willing to keep their jobs to overcome any city in revolt.  Keep in mind, without food, gas and electricity the people's will to fight will wane."
"The entire nation would need to rise up as one, but without the Internet, gas, food, etc, it'll be impossible."
"Americans barely won a war against a king 2,000 miles away.  But now the king is here, and owns everything. What are you going to fight a tank with???Tanks are easy when you have better resources than Afghanis have access to.> They're all Americans too."
"But they are the good Americans, and they will be attacking the villainous, murdering, traitorous un-Americans!"
"Happens all the time. Until they get a few million causalities in and then start to have doubts.Peaceful political revolution is still possible."
"Vote for Bernie Sanders, vote against our current Congress in your local elections.Not with that attitude.They said the same thing about the Roman Empire. That's interesting and relevant.  America will fall exactly (well, pretty spot on) as the Roman empire did.  In Rome, the people were given free bread and entertainment in return for voting the leaders into power. (As you probably know).  This is what lead to their collapse."
"But if you attempt to intervene with that process while the house of cards is still functioning, you will simply lose.  You can't beat it while it's working, and you can't stop it from failing. Isn't that ironic, don't you think?While popular, this version of the Roman fall has little to do with the actual problems the state faced that led to it's collapse. While corruption and political instability played a part, by themselves it wasn't enough to end the Empire. The rise of economies along the border and beyond, the cross training of barbarian warriors, the splitting of the empire, the Huns, over expansion, and the fall of the Roman Legion all played their part. It is one of the most contested and debated events in history.also the damage to the roman economy resulting from devaluing the currency by creating more monies to pay the large standing armyYou're right. It has to be considerably worse where nearly everyone's lives are miserable and to the breaking point of stress until the whole country will do anything to help each other. But they stop juuuust before that point.You gave away their secret, you're on a list now.Naww. It's been well documented, it's called 'Laffer's curve' since Laffer first discovered it. But... it is no laffing matter.So how much does the government value our privacy? what's the price tag on that fine?250k/day, doubling every month. It's what yahoo faced before buckling over. Man, the US needs a revolution. I say that only partly in jest. It'll never happen. People won't organize. There's too many distractions in this day and age. And those that do manage to organize will be pacified with free candy crush lives, celebrity nudes, etc."
"Finally the 0.001% that remain will be branded as terrorists and we all know 'Muricah feels about those.But this is literally how the roman empire fell.The Roman Empire didn't have 1/100000000th the military strength that the American government has. "
"A revolution without getting at least a relatively large portion of the military branches onboard would be crushed like a big within days.Except their standard of living was *way* lower. I wouldn't welcome a revolution right now. In principle, it *might* be better for future generations, but it would make my life suck. It would make all of our lives suck, and we probably wouldn't recover for generations, if ever. Maybe the first generation of organized government would be better because it's made of people dedicated to certain principles, but after we regained complacency, it would revert back to something similar to what we have now. At the end of the day, the government is always going to be made up of a bunch of people, and we're not going to change people."
"Instead, changes within our current government would be faster, smoother, and better long term. The people can't really do much (sadly), but big tech business could definitely come together. The tech industry might be the most likely to do it too. If they all threatened to move off shore to escape these fines, the government would *have* to comply.Apple should pass the fines onto its consumers and call it the NSA dick pics tax on its receipts.  Companies need to get creative in showing that they care for us.Apple products even more expensive!?they are usually comparable to products in their segment (high end tablet/smartphones, ultrabooks and high end all in ones, and whatever segment the Mac pro falls into). You pay for a device that isn't funded with ad revenue and has amazing support inside of an actual store.Except, you get none of that support outside the US."
"EDIT: Seriously. The next Apple store for me is 2 hours away by car, I don't have a car as I live in a large city, so I'd need to pay 40EUR for long-distance rail there and back, an I'd spend a whole day on that."
"The only realistic support I can get from Apple is going to a licensed 3rd-party repair shop, of which there are equally many licensed for Apple, SAMSUNG, LG, etc.I don't know which outside the US you're in, but I've only ever once had to take an Apple product to be repaired. It was in Vietnam, where there are no (or at least, were at the time no) actual Apple stores. There are, however, Apple authorised (3rd party) retailers and authorised repair shops. I took it to one of those, and my computer was repaired free of charge under Apple Care."
"Actual Apple stores may be difficult to come by (existing in only 16 countries, according to my Googling), but Apple authorised places certainly are not.Yes, but there are just as many (if not more) authorised repair shops for SAMSUNG, LG, ASUS, etc."
"And for a 200$ markup compared to competitors of the same hardware, Apple has to provide faaar better support than competitors."
"Which it doesn't."
"One of the reasons why Apple's market share outside of the US is very low."
"In Germany it's hovering between 15.3% and 17.4% (according to Forbes),  "
"while in the US it's between 47.7% and 39.3%$200 markup? Samsung's flagships cost just as much as Apple's."
"Same hardware? I didn't realize that Apple now sell's its custom SoC to other smartphone manufacturers. Example? No Apple Stores in most places? So nowhere to get direct support? And everything you get from Apple here is the support that's mandated by law, which is 2 years of replacing everything that was damaged through a manufacturers error."

"You see how the support grid is far worse outside the US?How many iPhone users are there in those countries? If you compare the ratio of iPhone users to the number of stores in each country, you'll probably get a conclusion.In Germany, it's 15% of the market, in the US more like 47%."
"But obviously, if you make a product that is only more attractive than competitors because of good support, but then only provide the support, or Apple Pay, or so on in the US, obviously it won't fly internationally.Apple is the only OEM retailer with that many stores thoughAnd? Does that number most stores help me at all when the next store is 2h away by car, and I don't have a car? I'd have to take long-distance rail to get to the next Apple Store."
"For me, and many people outside of the US, Apple might have more stores, but the support we get is not better than from any competitors.apple is likely the only OEM with a sizeable amount of detail stores.It mostly has those stores in the US, though."
"In the rest of the world, Apple - like every other manufacturer - has licensed 3rd party retailers and is sold in normal stores."
"And AppleCare is even the legally mandatory minimum that every manufacturer has to provide in Germany for 2 years - so it's not better than competitors in that regard either."
"But, even though the support here is the same as the support competitors provide, Apple has the same price as in the US.Can you find an OEM retailer with that kind of coverage then?Yes, many. SAMSUNG has just as many licensed repair shops here."
"And for laptops and computers, FUJITSU is unbeatable."
"I had an issue with my computer because the audio port stopped working, I called, 30 minutes later they were standing in front of my door with a letter, I gave them the PC, and they came back 2 hours later, had replaced the mainboard with a new one.Weird. What was that place with the Apple logo on it that replaced my MacBook Air a few months ago? In Berlin, Germany?"
"Also - what was the company that had my busted iPhone picked up by courier and replaced within four days, in Germany?"
"Who is doing this for Apple? And why isn't Apple doing it? This is so weird...I live in Germany, in a large city, the next Apple Store for me is 2 hours away by car."
"And I don't have a car. So I'd need to take the ICE long-distance rail, probably to Hamburg or Berlin. Spend a whole day and 40EUR just to get there and back."
"---"
"Apple has more stores in the US than in the rest of the world."
"In the US, every Apple store serves 1.2 million people. In the rest of the World, every store serves on average between 5.7 million (Germany) to 52.6 million (China) and 101.2 million (Brazil)"
"Which shows that the support network of Apple is far thinner.Then take it to a certified repair center. Unlike Apple, none of your other devices even have an Apple Store-esque optionBut, that's my argument: Apple does not provide me with an Apple Store-esque option either."
"The next Apple Store is 100km away, so for me, Apple Stores effectively do not exists. Still the price for an Apple product contains the cost of these stores."
"I literally pay for something I can never use.They should take a slight hit in the cost, since their shit is WAAAAY overpriced anyway.  That way the could charge the fee while still keeping the phones at the same cost.They don't care about you.  They are economic entities and incapable of emotion.   Unless there's profit involved, they will not do anything for you.  Anything else will result in shareholders selling shares.The Unconstitutional domestic surveillance by the US government tax.This is the Netflix approach. When Comcast was treating them like ass, they just bitched about it to their customers. It was pretty effective.My security is worth a tax like this. I'd happily pay it. Hmm, I would not.No one should pay to be allowed their presumed privacy.Well unfortunately no security is free so you pay for it in one form or another whether you're protecting yourself from the government or some hacker in China. I agree. It's noble for people on here to be ready to pay the tax, but the fact that it would even need to get to that point shows how sad the state of affairs is here in the U.S.  Gone are the days that the government at least *pretended* it wanted to protect us. Now it's gotten so jaded that they're basically saying *We have power, you don't. We set the rules, and if you don't comply - FUCK YOU!*Yeah things were so much better when the government pretended to care but still did whatever they wanted to anyway. This isn't anything new. Companies only care about themselves. That's how business works. "
"When companies are really good at caring about themselves, the benefits are seen by the consumers.I will gladly pay itDid you not read the part in the article that said the fines would equal the entire U.S. National debt by month 5?"
"The options are shut down, or comply. I think they should shut down if it comes to that. I simply can't understand why a company would comply with such a completely ridiculous threat. Firstly I would make that shit public in a heartbeat. Yahoo would have been in a position where they could have let all of their customers know about that. Second, even if the goverment would write yahoo's debt into oblivion, then the public would get to know about it. Maybe I'm too naive, but I can't understand, that threats as ridiculous as this can work. I bet some yahoo employees had to fear for their lifes if they didn't comply with the goverments intentions.gag orders and the fact that their engineers have families to feed... and the government knows it.You cannot gag order a fine, though, right? These are publicly traded companies, they have reporting requirements to comply with. They can't just let $250,000 magically disappear from their records.Seeing as how they would have to pay a ton of money anyway if they didn't give up the data they could just give all of their employees the money and close down.The government has a monopoly on force. That's the point of the government. If Yahoo did not comply with the fines, the government has the power to empty their bank accounts, repossess their assets, etc."
"Of course, if they actually did that, publicly, it would be a hell of  a shitshow. Companies would immediately begin exiting the country and pulling out assets from American banks."
"It could start another depression. I mean a real 1929 style depression. One that would make the 2008 one look like a minor dip in sales figures.The fines proposed would be to enforce the court order. In Yahoo's case, they were cumulative and doubled every month."
"From the article: "
">By month five, Yahoo would have faced fines upwards of the entire U.S. national debt, and then some."
"These are not something you can pass along.  At some point, the amount will go high enough that a buffer overflow will occur and Apple will be owed a lot of money.> Apple should pass the fines onto its consumers and call it the NSA dick pics tax on its receipts."
"Yeah this could end up being a bit of a culture shift: Companies may realize that consumers will actually pay MORE if they know that their data will not be just handed over and they will pay fines if the government levies them.I would actually do this, assuming that it's proven that they actually don't hand data over.I'm just too cynical to believe there ever is a way to prove that a company does not hand over data.open source FTW!What's interesting then is how many complaints were thrown, right here on reddit, when Apple announced the new iCloud storage sizes and costs.  While I agree with you completely, I still bet that the average consumer doesn't know or care.  It's absolutely amazing how many people don't understand this problem nor do they understand that they should be fighting for the right to encrypt.It's also interesting since John Oliver showed that dick-pics is a point where the average joe is really against surveillance. I know you say this in jest, but maybe it's not a terrible idea. It would suck for us, sure, but I bet it would draw some awareness to the issue.I wouldn't even be mad really. We are already paying, we just don't know now. It should also include all the losses caused when people abandoned American tech firms due to the revaluations. plenty of bars do it in areas where there are absurdly high alcohol taxes. makes sense. This one bar near my house has the two sales taxes listed as Harper's cut and wynnes cut (Ontario, Canada)My problem with this is technological, and it's an almost invisible slippery slope that the UK has already gone down..."
"Apple isn't refusing give the US government data that it has. What they're saying is that they don't have the data. The data the Government wants is encrypted on one phone, sent through Apple's servers and decrypted on the target phone. Apple has no more access to this data than a malicious third party."
"What the government is saying is that creating a truly secure communications mechanism is, in effect, illegal. *This is very dangerous*. It makes US-developed technology immediately second-rate and puts our major technology industries in a very difficult position in the global market."
"For example, Samsung could claim that they can no longer trust Google to make their OS, fork Android and re-implement their own social stack (gmail, hangouts, etc.) and the public might actually rally behind that."
"The US government is effectively destroying the currency of freedom in the global marketplace. Bravo."
"B b b b b but bad guys! This shit really needs to stop. Why haven't the courts ruled this sort of behavior unconstitutional?  Because they don't care about the constitution.Which courts? The secret ones?Government needs to impose sanctions on Apple so Apple can take the case to the supreme court and end the issue of overbroad surveillance once and for all.The same people that staff the spying agencies staff the courts.Do we assume Google and MS have already provided backdoor access?google uses your data and my data to make moneyGive [this](https://wikileaks.org/google-is-not-what-it-seems/) a read if you want to get bummed out about Google.Yes, sadly. Basically google makes money from using your data for better ads, complying is easy and they can't prevent compliance without screwing up their business model. Apple makes money from selling phones and computers, they don't care about your data and it's easy for them to comply (and is kind of an advantage over Google). Microsoft is in the middle, but I hope they shift to making money off software and not needing data.They're actually exactly shifting to making money off data and not software. This is why we now have free Windows 10 upgrades.Judging by the Windows 10 nonsense I don't have much hope. >Microsoft is in the middle, but I hope they shift to making money off software and not needing data."
"Have you seen Windows 10? It looks like they've made their decision.It's stuff like this that makes me realize that the companies are smart for moving over seas. They don't have to deal with the government trying to fine them for not letting them into their products. yes but Nabisco didnt move Oreo manufacturing out of America because of encryption policyOther countries are just as bad about it.Some other countries, but there are also dozens of much better countries when it comes to data security.That's why you have a choice of where to move. If you're a tech company, Somalia isn't really an option."
"Really, the countries you'd really think about moving to are usually just as bad.A research tech company would do at least some research and see which countries are suitable or not. Apple could literally go move to Togo and lay down infrastructure for themselves while propelling Togo into the 21st century with the money they would have been fined with by the US. Or Brazil or Kazakhstan or whatever. They'll research extensively. Chance of any of that happening: 0%."
"The world's best engineers and programmers aren't going to want to move to the middle of nowhere to live in Apple's company town in Kazakhstan.Just make your own country, just for server farms. Like [sea land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Sealand).> the companies are smart for moving over seas"
"Well, not EU. EU is terrible tooThis is something that is not exclusive to the U.S government.Companies move overseas to avoid taxes and regulation.That's not really true, well about tax. Taxes are paid on profits, which are issued as dividends. As they are American stocks the dividend is paid in America and you can't hide profit. What they do is avoid moving money into America from subsidiaries that have already paid tax located outside of America. This delays taxation, but doesn't avoid it.So the net result is a financial advantage having money overseas. That's what I'm referring to...An advantage by not brining money in straight away, it will still be taxed one day. Plus no big U.S company is moving taxable profit from the U.S to overseas to avoid taxation. That would be silly. "
">Companies move overseas"
"This is why I said you where wrong, the money is from European/Asian and South American profits. They are just holding them until they can figure out what to do with them. They aren't proactively moving overseas  like you suggested.Here kid, read this: http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/u-s-companies-are-stashing-2-1-trillion-overseas-to-avoid-taxesI read it all. They are keeping vast profits from subsidiaries outside the U.S, in those subsidiaries. Not paying them to the parent corporation to then pay out as dividends and be subject to corporation tax. However the only real way for them to issue that profit is to pay dividends, making it impossible to avoid American corporation tax. They money is stashed, not being taken as profit by the owners before paying tax. There is a difference. Plus my main point was they weren't moving operations overseas to avoid tax.You're missing my point. That is still their money. Read the article again. You can reword all you'd like. My original comment is valid.>You're missing my point. "
"Which is?"
">My original comment is valid."
"Except it isn't really."
"You have downvoted my comments and aimed snide remarks like kid at me. It's a very school boy attempt at winning an argument, where winning is more important than engaging in discussion and understanding different view points. Which this last complete dismissal of me is more evidence of in my eyes. I would suggest you either grow up or become more open minded in future discussions. It will genuinely benefit you, even in situations where your argument is correct.They ARE proactively keeping cash offshores. Not moving overseas though which was the original comment.Except a federal ruling recently said Microsoft has to hand over Irish server data. There's no point leaving.It hasn't actually been ruled on yet has it? I thought it was just in court. They won initially and it's currently being appealed. Heres an article from 2014 about [it.](http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-files-fresh-appeal-against-handing-over-email-in-irish-datacentre)Which they refused to comply with, multiple times in fact, and are in the process of appealing it.Of course they refuse. They have to.Irish government has made crystal clear to Microsoft, that if they release any data from Irish server without Irish court court order they are in deep trouble.I'm pretty sure that would be a violation of EU law to do so, so they would be in deep shit in any case. Hand it over and be in shit with the EU, or don't hand it over and be in shit with the US. Except that was very difficult and hasn't actually succeeded in getting the data yetPresumably because Microsoft is HQ'd in the US.Doesn't have to be HQ, if you have any US operations they can just go after those staff. Not necessarily, if the h.q. is foreign but they have a server in the U.S., that U.S. Server may be accessible but they wouldn't be able to use that to get information from other foreign servers. I believe the gov main argument is that the HQ is based I the U.S. and they can readily access and retrieve the data from the foreign server. "
"The problem is that the courts are extremely far behind in their understanding of the Internet and technology in general. By granting the governments subpoena/warrant the court would basically be allowing our government to legally access the information of anyone who uses the foreign servers, including foreign citizens. This could lead to a huge backlash from foreign governments against American tech companies. "
"If the court denies the order, then criminals can use foreign servers to shield their activities from the U.S. Government . While that might seem like an important issue its really a bit of a red herring because their are mechanisms for the U.S. Government to make this request for information through the foreign governments, but it's a pain in the ass for them."
"I think the order should be denied and the government should work with their foreign counterparts to figure out a system to get the information they need without violating the rights of foreign citizens or crippling the tech industry and basically forcing them to spy on their users for the government. > I think the order should be denied and the government should work with their foreign counterparts"
"Can't see that working in the long run. Just as there are tax havens nowdays, there will just form information havens in the future.The logic is similar to a scenario where an American fugitive crosses into Mexico and then saying, well he's American we have the right to go after him. An American citizen conducting emails through Ireland is similar. Similar how you would get the Mexican police to chase a fugitive, go through Irish courts to get the data released.Yea I agree and that crossed my mind, but I think it's in our best interest as a country to have this ordered denied. Will criminals get away with things? Sure, but there have always been other means of investigation and this isn't their only option. "
"I do not think the investigative benefits out weigh the societal benefits of keeping our governments powers in check. They pretty much do whatever they want now, and I don't think this minute limitation will hurt them in any meaningful way. > Not necessarily, if the h.q. is foreign but they have a server in the U.S., that U.S. Server may be accessible but they wouldn't be able to use that to get information from other foreign servers."
"That is true, but I was more talking about if they had any staff members in the states. The government could try going after them and prosecuting them or finding them in contempt of court until their parent company complies. "
">I think the order should be denied and the government should work with their foreign counterparts"
"100% agree. You don't even need staff members. It's about 'doing business' in the US. Even if you had no operations, the US could compel VISA/Mastercard to not accept payments from US customers to you. I believe this has happened before.But I imagine you can only be forced to hand over data regarding your US operations."
"For example, a European company operating in the US would not have to hand over server data based in Europe (or at least server data pertaining to non-US citizens)."
"Meanwhile Microsoft can be forced to hand over *all* it's data, wherever it's based. That's a significant difference.The US can demand whatever they want. And if it's ruled so in secret FISA court, they can prevent you from doing business in the US. Technically they can't *force* you to hand over non-US info, but they can definitely make it economically unfeasible for you to not.Which is why companies and not only data is starting to move overseas.In our control-obsessed politicians' attempts to solidify their elite status in society and wrap everyone in a plastic bubble for *safety*, they're really destroying the economic engine of this country. The government needs to get out of our lives for the most part. The less involuntary interaction the better.That's because Microsoft is based in the US. If they were say completely based in Ireland this wouldn't be an issue.United States reached out and ended Megaupload, a New Zealand company. This was years ago and they're still preventing Megaupload from accessing their data.>Completely based in Ireland this wouldn't be an issue."
"No big company nowadays is completely based in one country, the internet is global by design. Every tech company will have operations in the U.S. If those get threatened for not carrying out something in a different part of the world in the interest of one country, it's just going to break up the internet. Could you imagine if China said to Microsoft's China division we will sue your Chinese division and take all your assets if you don't provide us with emails in the states, people would go apeshit."
"Plus my point was there was no point leaving operations, they will just threaten any assets you have left in the U.S.I really can't wait for China to do that, if anything just to see the people in Washington get up on the podium and be as hypocritical as humanly possible. You realize Obama just said he would start a cyberwar with China if they keep hacking.  Meanwhile our own 'cyber intelligence' (god I hate that term) actively compromises other country's government systems and private systems.  We are a country built basically on hypocrisy. As usual, relevant xkcd: http://xkcd.com/1573/"
"> The obvious flaw in this system is that the government could potentially force Apple to add an additional public key to your account, which would be analogous to registering an extra device"
"How will they get this public key? Can you generate a new public key without the access to the private key? If so, isn't the whole system broken?What that means is that they generate new public/private key pair. The private key belongs to themselves and is not seen by anyone else. By adding their public key to the target account, other people sending a message to the target account would then also encrypt it with that public key that can be decrypted with their private key."
"The reason this works is that iMessage wants you to be able to read your message on multiple devices without you having to copy over the private key. It also means that you can revoke iMessage access for a specific device later on (if you get rid of an iPad, iPhone, or laptop to upgrade it to a newer version)."
"All of that makes sense. Right now you get a popup whenever a new private/public key pair is added to your account on all connected devices. The government could force them to implement a way to add new pairs silently."
"The alternative to this model is a model where everyone that talks to you needs to know what devices belong to you. That means people messaging you would need to take action (for instance by confirming a popup) whenever you add a new device to your account. Since that's a pretty common event and you have a lot of contacts it would make things way more complex.That's not how it works."
"Apple runs what amounts to a phone book lookup service, where your device public key is listed."
"They can add new keys at will, and iMessage clients don't tell you what public keys your recipients is said to have. So they can add a keypair they control, instead of just keypairs the recipient controls. Wouldn't Apple's notification system of when new devices are added to your account mean you'd receive a notification? I assume that notification is triggered by the creation of a new key associated with a device?Not necessarily. The notification exists for the security of the end-user. If Apple were compelled to add another device to the account, only for surveillance purposes, it would clearly be under a gag order to do so, and would not notify the end user.Shut your doors, Apple."
"Send everyone on vacation, and stop all development, manufacturing, and support. Close every Apple Store, and shut down every manufacturing plant. Issue a statement that you'd rather see Apple vanish than capitulate to government bullies."
"They can't *make* you work, but I'm sure you won't be on vacation long when a billion consumers start demanding that the government back off."
"Make history once again. Don't compromise, don't negotiate, don't back down or capitulate. Tell the government **no**, and don't lift a finger until they leave you alone."

"*EDIT 2: Thank you, kind stranger for the Gold.*"
"*EDIT 3: Yes, I'm aware there's a bit of hyperbole in the explanation above, but the general sensibility that Apple should make a BIG HAIRY DEAL out of being PUNISHED for REFUSING TO COMPLY with the government's demand that they cripple their security features remains. I realize they have shareholders to satisfy, but I DON'T think a general strike - if handled with principle and courage - would, in the long term, cause Apple's demise. Even if it did, it would be far better to see them crushed into nonexistence than to be broken and made a tool for government. Apple needs to fight this HARD.*[deleted]where's that commercial...Dude, can you imagine if one of the largest companies to ever exist shut themselves down entirely, just to tell the government *no?*. To say that you are repeatedly and aggressively trying to bully us into giving you data on our customers, and we won't do it. We would rather watch our company die than to hand it over to you, so we are done operating until you stop."
"I don't think they'd ever do it, but think about if they actually did. That *would* be history.Wouldn't it make more sense for Apple to just move their entire operation to a different country? I mean, probably, but that's not what we were talking about.Well, having the U.S. Government cripple a linchpin of even the global economy out of authoritarian and tyrannical reasons may make history. "
"I really kind of hope Apple, MS, and Google work together on this. Maybe they should shut down all their services for a single day. Maybe even with a message train your weapons on the capital or whatever the chick in the final Hunger Games says.When was the last time a global company told the state it wasn't going to so much as cut the grass or sweep the floors until it backed off?That's not what he had a problem with, it's saying they already made history. I don't get how you couldn't see that..."
"Edit: Not my view, just saying that it was quite obvious what he meant, even if you disagree.I'd say the apple 2 was a big enough deal that it deserves a spot in history. The rest of it, not so much.The iPhone has shaped modern life/society as significantly as just about anything else in the last 20 years.  I won't make the claim it was the first smartphone, but it was the first one that matters.World's first smartphone."
"It may not be the signing of the Declaration of Independence, but in technological and social terms, the iPhone is quite a historic achievement.I#d love to see you sensibly define the term 'smartphone' in such a way that the iPhone was the first."
"The first fashionable smartphone, perhapsIt's simple, isn't it? The first Internet-capable phone with a full-fledged browser, a touchscreen large enough, high enough  in resolution and responsive enough to use for extensive web browsing, full email capabilities, etc. that was actually usable and capable enough to bring the concept to the masses. "
"Sure, there were smart phones before the iPhone. I've used them all, and they were all complete and utter shit. "
"The iPhone was the first phone of its kind. No keys, no stylus necessary, no WAP, a fully HTML compliant browser that understood CSS... There was nothing even remotely like it before the iPhone. Saying otherwise is ridiculously disingenuous. First decent smartphoneThe iPhone (2007) [wasn't in any way the word's first smartphone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone#History)."
"The IBM Simon (1992) was the first phone with PDA features, and was literally the first device called a smartphone. NTT DoCoMo released a series of smartphones that were the first to get mainstream adoption in Japan in 1999. The Ericsson R30 (2000) was the first phone to be marketed with the term smartphone, and had PDA and web browsing features."
"Why is the iPhone important? It was *so much better* than all the smartphones before it, and was the first smartphone to gain widespread mass adoption among people who weren't geeks and business people in the US. It was multitouch only, which was relatively new at the time. It had the best mobile web browser at the time (being able to show non stripped down or reformatted pages with an interface that made it pleasant was revolutionary). It also had a waaay better interface than anything else that existed at the time."
"Apple is rarely the first in a product category. They refine the hell out of existing ideas and open up product categories to new audiences. "
"Sent from my iPhone. :)[I mean Google did in 2010.](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704117304575137960803993890)The British East Indian Company once WAS a state.The Dutch East India Company laugh at your puny excuse of an Indian CompanyJust scrolled up to make sure I wasn't on /r/appleWhy, because for once Reddit isn't taking every possible stab at Apple they can?"
"Yeah, it is weird.iPod and iPhone."
"'Nuff said.> A bit hyperbolic perhaps?"
"Yeah. Being the biggest company in history doesn't constitute Making history.Holy shit this is so factually inaccurate.  And up voted highly.  And all the responses pointing this out are down voted.  "
"Oh reddit.  You are such a suckhole of shit sometimes.  Rofl, literally anything is making history you can draw the line wherever.Eli Whitney is famous, I learned about him in atleast 4 different grades, and all he did was invent the fucking cotton gin. I think the smart phone is atleast as historic. Apple didn't invent the smart phone. People seem to forget that Windows Mobile and Blackberry devices were out before 2007.  I got the first iPhone when it came out, sure.  I was tired of the brick that I'd been carrying.  But I was quickly pissed off to find some very basic features that I'd been using for years were completely missing from it.You mean like copy/paste? Or a decent touch screen?That and no MMS were the two that I remember most. Apple invented the iPhone, which was the first smartphone people wanted to use. Apple gets no claim to fully inventing most of their popular consumer product's as a segment but what they did was they created a phone people wanted, a tablet people wanted, and computer people wanted, etc. which certainly gave birth to segments like smartphones and tablets.It's hard to pinpoint what exactly made the original iPhone special, but two things really stand out for me: a capacitive touchscreen and the application store. Apple executed really well in those two areas.And that's why they made money.When the original iPhone was released on June 27th, 2007 there wasn't an appstore yet. The iPhone App Store opened on July 10, 2008, via an update to iTunes. The original plan was for the phone to run webapps developed by third parties along with the native apps that came with the phone. Yeah, I shouldn't have said the original iPhone. Just in general, I think why the iPhone kicked everyone's ass is because of those two things. Here's an [interesting graph](http://www.statista.com/statistics/263401/global-apple-iphone-sales-since-3rd-quarter-2007/) showing sales. The App Store really changed the game for them imo.Apple doesn't invent anything. They *create* demand. They take an idea, make it incredibly consumer friendly and market it better than any other company on the planet. "
"For what it's worth, this isn't a bad thing. The residual benefits to even their closest competitors, by creating new markets, has been incalculable. Well. With the exception of Blackberry. But that was RIM's own fault for not being able to adapt quickly.what?"
"Samsung is much bigger than Apple. "
"Hell, Samsung more or less makes everything. "
"Fridges, washers, driers, monitors, computers, CPUs, RAM, TVs, apartment complexes, Military equipment, etc. "
"Apple makes a few phones and computers. >> biggest company in history"
"Pre 17th century joint stock companies? Late 19th - early 20th century monopoly companies?Not even closeapple isn't and has never been the biggest company in history...I'd say the VOC was the biggest company in history. "
"If the VOC existed in 2015 they would just have taken Washington and stormed the White House with their armyThe East India Company probably takes that title. > don't lift a finger until they leave you alone."
"Well - there's one finger they could raise....Um...APPL shareholder here; please don't do this Apple.For real. I always wondered what would happen if a company like Apple could somehow leverage their popularity to make the govt back off.There is an amusing irony in here about how we hate it that large corporations have such power over the legislative process (lobby groups, sponsoring campaigns, etc), but in this case we do seem to want that power of a large corporation. Not judging anything, just an observation.Oh you want a PR war? Just let the government get their paedophile and terrorist card deck out...The government will just round up the executives and jail them on trumped-up charges, claim they are engaging in economic terrorism or some such nonsense.  ...who is John Galt? The iPhone is the engine of the world?...I'd actually buy something Apple if they did this and the dust finally settled.  #AppleBlackout"
"I want to believe.If we had voted for people who actually are for minimal government interaction and regulation in our lives, we wouldn't be here with the NSA requesting our dick pics. The candidates have been there. We should expect better from politicians, but you can really thank the lowest common denominator majority of this country for a lot of it.Regulation's good, dick pic collectors are bad. These two things are very, very different. I like regulation. It's kind of an important part of what prevents us from becoming a banana republic.I didn't say no regulation, just minimal. The state serves a purpose: rummaging through pictures of my barbecue party are not one of them and the idea that it even *might* be is moronic. Get a warrant in a non-secret federal court like it's supposed to be.We're on the same page thereThis is some Atlas Shrugged level shitIf they did this, I'd buy like 10 ipads afterwards.I've never owned an apple product in my life,but if they pulled this off my next phone would be an iPhone. nice try Microsoft CEOMicrosoft? Apple and Microsoft *love* each other these days. Microsoft had a pride-of-place spot in Apple's most recent announcement, demonstrating Office for iPad on the new 12 inch iPad."
"Nice try, Google CEO would have been a better fit, these days, or Samsung CEO.Please do this apple.  I will buy Apple for life if they do this.Honestly I would convert to Apple in that case. I know Google sold out, and has Microsoft, so, yeah, I would convert to Apple if they're going to be respective of privacy.Hmm. Stop making money hand over fist or comply with the government because the people you sell to aren't individuals. They're sales figures."
"While I agree with you, something like that will never happen when you're in the business of making a fuck ton of money.I think they would."
"I think their stock would SOAR if they stood up to the government."
"They'd make so much money the iPhone 7 would be *free*.Yeaaaa, that's not how the real world works. Sorry, kiddo. Again I doubt it. The market is based off of investors. Investors care about money. If a company suddenly stops making any money whatsoever investors will scatter like rats in the light making their stock crash."
"And Apple would never give away a phone for free. That company (and many others) do everything in their power to milk you for any extra cent they can. Custom charge ports, custom cables, custom docks, etc."
"Them refusing to allow a backdoor isn't about protecting their users. It's about the bad publicity it would garner them if they were to actually do so and because they don't want an outside entity being able to play around in their system.That's just a little hyperbole, but it's not entirely fantastic: they did make OSX free, and *lots* of development money and resources goes into that.It may be free to upgrade, but the computers still cost an arm and a leg, partially to cover development costs. It's not as if they're giving the OS away, just free upgrades[deleted]> They'd make so much money the iPhone 7 would be free."
"I wish it worked that way.> I think their stock would SOAR if they stood up to the government."
"If you think shutting down all production would make stock soar, my advice to you is to keep hold of your money.Why would their stock soar? They would be losing money every minute they are shut. The stock would do the opposite>Why would their stock soar? They would be losing money every minute they are shut. The stock would do the opposite"
"Until the government backed down, then it would soar. Who wouldn't want the device the government can't spy on, made by a company who stood up for your privacy.If they stopped selling product, their stock would tank. It would also cause havoc on the market due to their market cap being so large.Yep. And the world would know that they'd rather close than sell out their customers. It would effect all markets. US tech would tank soon after, illustrating the government's unreasonable demand for back doors. The gov't would have to back down. Apple's devices would be in greater demand than ever for being secure.> The gov't would have to back down"
"Are you kidding? Clearly you haven't had many dealings with the US government. Stubborn executives would have tragic automobile accidents while CIA operatives whistled innocently before the government would back down.Also, tempting the US government's regulatory pimp hand by challenging its authority has never really worked out great.Yep. Ask yahoo about it.*I work in television.*Plus, Apple probably has the money to deny the order, and failing that, lawyers to hold the order up in court for decades.Apple makes money on hardware, not user data like Google. They have a huge incentive to not give in.What do you think the lawsuit is going to cost them? Air?For a company which had more cash on hand than the government a few years ago, can't say cost is a major concern for them.  Now that this is in the news, and all eyes are on Apple, folding to government pressure would tarnish their image and potentially cost them far more than the cost of the lawsuit.While I agree that shutting down completely is not an option for Apple, if they were as cynical as you're suggesting, then why haven't they folded already? If they don't care about consumers (of which they are as well) then why take this to court in the first place? Just automatically comply with the govt., because it doesn't matter, right? Or maybe even the people who run soulless corporations also have lines in the sand that they don't want to cross. That fighting, and even losing can bring these govt. over-reaches to light and hopefully generate enough anger from the populous to change the direction of this surveillance state. Or not, whatever. Back to Crossyroad.[Feels relevant.](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/99449/3779149-no+you+move+cap+says.jpg)I wish yahoo would have stood firm and gone down in flames as the American government crushed it for not complying with a tyrannical order. It would have been the best way to go out, because now, yahoo is just atrophying into nothingness. At least that way people would have heralded yahoo as heroes instead of a footnote.Exactly. Don't negotiate with terrorists. Could you imagine if they released a statement that they do not negotiate with any form of terrorism, whether it be domestic or abroad and that they consider what the government is doing to be terroristic "
"Would be amazing. Foreign or Domestic Welcome to The RockWinners go home and fuck the prom queen. "
"Carla *was* the prom queen. It's things like this that make me hate being an American. Why the fuck does our government feel they reserve this right, regardless of democrat or republican?  "
"Having access to citizens' private data hasn't actually deterred any crime or criminal activity in the last few years. NSA and TSA are gigantic farces that don't do any public good. It's all a fucking mess. And it's heartbreaking. "
"I hate that Apple must lead the fight when it should be every single tech company and every single person because we're all being affected. I wonder what would happen if Apple or Yahoo went bankrupt resisting. Stocks would plummet and people would be outraged. Maybe it would be a catalyst for change. The competitors will just step in, comply and double down. It's a cut throat world. If Apple shut their doors in protest, Google and its Android manufacturers would reap the rewards. There's a reason that you don't see a big conglomerate of these companies banding together to fight this - Apple doesn't see user data and doesn't sell access to it. Other companies do. With its current setup, Apple literally cannot access the data and hand it over. Google combs through every piece of your data already. While it's true that Apple is choosing to stay out of the information business, the issue of government surveillance impacts the entire IT sector. The idea that all American companies have to hand over everyone's data is incredibly damaging to the industry as a whole. The only reason Google can't fight against the government the same way as Apple is because it needs access to user data in order to function, whereas Apple does not. Other than that they are on the same side and both are most likely putting pressure on the government. You just don't hear about it because of the gag orders.If the second largest company in the world went bankrupt over this, there would be backlash.  Only if the public could stay misinformed over the first companies reasons for being bankrupt. Man those tech companies could just send a fucking email to every customer and they had greater coverage than any news agency in a minute. They U.S is fucking over it's tech buisnesses so hard especially U.S buisnesses with cloud services, the U.S is going to stop being the tech capital of the world. With the NSA and Microsoft being forced to hand over data from Ireland countries outside of the U.S are starting to not trust companies inside the U.S. Which is bad news for companies like Apple because their growth market is outside of the U.S. They should literally comply."
"They should literally hand over a copy of the messages as they transit through their servers."

Government privacy invasion isn't a reason to not protest over racist police brutality...For starters, this issue, just like with TPP, isn't really seen as a personal threat by the majority who hear about it. It's just too abstract for most people. I really admire Cook & Co for standing up, but it needs to be a much bigger movement involving all kinds of companies. If there is anything Apple does, it's the ability to get consumers to believe in something. I think they could get the ball rolling on this if push comes to shove. Silicon Valley needs to relocate all assets to a new country. They need to pull together money to buy Greece. Apple could do it all on their own with change left for Starbucks and Voodoo.At least it a company that can afford a few billions in fines.Yahoo faced fines of 250,000/day, doubling every month."

"To make it to 1/1/2017, the cost would be  $251,295,750,000."
"----"
"Fun addition:  The current US National Debt is about $18.3 trillion according to http://www.usdebtclock.org/#"
"If the fines kept going in a similar fashion, Apple's total payment would surpass the current national debt on 7/5/2017.  At this point in the pay scheme, the daily fine would be $524 billion."
"By the start of 2018, the daily fine would be $33.5 trillion.19-20 months, so about a year and a halfWow this shit is ridiculous. Forcing companies to allow the government to spy on whoever they want. Shit needs to change or eventually people will get feed up and the news will be talking about mass movement of Americans to other countries and American refuges escape an every more control and restricting government. People love to shit on apple for a lot of reasons. But when push comes to shove they stand by their morals fairly often. Ive always been proud of them putting their money where their mouth is. I'll say it bluntly. My life is boring. I eat, sleep, shit, work, watch shit, play some shit and so it goes. At the end of the day, I'm a boring person and could give a rats ass if the government saw my shit. But you know what, it's none of your fucking business. Nothing but a bunch of disingenuous assholes who have no right to know about me if I'm not committing anything illegal that they can directly see. If I take the risk of committing illegal activities than I'll pay the consequence when you catch me. But don't drag every other innocent person through some bullshit spy game for the greater good. It's not your business to know or even glimpse at how Americans conduct there daily life's. Leave us the fuck alone.This is going to make it hard for some people to bash Apple as much as they usually do.No it won't. The circlejerk never stops.It funny how people always make Apple out as the evil guys in tech. Mean while Microsoft is recording every action you do on windows 10, even sneaking some of the stuff onto windows 7. And well, google probably knows all of your personal details and sells everything about.  Hope and change everybody.I can't help but wonder how much of this is a lack of change due to politicians' apathy and how much is a lack of change because the NSA has them all by the nips and knows all their career-ending secrets. But will anyone.... face... time??? TeeheeheeeApple refuses backdoor access, they get a wimpy fine."
"I refuse backdoor access and I don't get my internship. "
"Go figure.It's not even in refusing back door access. From my understanding: There WAS no backdoor access. That is to say, that the government is suing Apple for committing the unforgivable sin of allowing for the mobile communication between two parties that is incapable of having its meaning intercepted by a third party. And I don't even think there is evil intent here. It's just a bunch of fucking control freaks who can't stand that making good technology comes with the price of enabling criminals who now have the ability to utilize it. And this power isn't the ability to cause massive kinetic damage to a wide area. It's simply the ability to communicate with the peace of mind that someone can't intercept that communications. Well, either everyone has potential access to those communications or no one does, because hackers have the same ability to get through those backdoors as any suit.If Apple switches from their current model I will very disappointed and will consider getting a different device when I upgrade. I consider Apple to be ahead of all the other because of their iMessage privacyThis is the kind of shit people need to get pissed over.Why would the government need access to everyone?  While they claim it is about security, it hasn't stopped anything so far with what they have already got.  So this leads some thought that rather than looking out for terrorists, this data is looking for dissidence.  While you think the government is working hard to protect you, they really are working hard to make sure there is no revolution against the upcoming fascism.I'm a little surprised to see Apple refusing backdoor data access but I'm glad they're being the good guys. This is total corruption though, and completely unacceptable.Why would you be surprised? Historically Apple has always been ahead of the pack regarding user privacy. Apple has always been a laissez-faire business. They believe in their ecosystem and they determine who accesses what. I use to hate that but as I grow older and have less time to tinker... I like that Apple takes a lot of my headache away via this. Oh, wherever shall they find the resources to fight this in court?  I think Apple products are overpriced and unimpressive, but one thing I really applaud them is their commitment to privacy. I'm looking for a new phone this year and since most Android manufacturers are now charging iPhone-prices for their top models anyway, it may be the first time I'm buying an Apple product since the scroll-wheel iPod over a decade ago.I don't particularly like apple, but kudos to them for this!So what law are the feds allegedly enforcing that allows them to make such an order and levy the fine for contempt? They just make some shit up, and if the other party doesn't comply, they fine them into submission?"
"This is some 'we demand a shrubbery!' shit.This reminds me of something Dennis Miller said when the justice department was fining Microsoft $1M per day. At this rate they'll be broke just ten years after the earth goes crashing into the sun.Why would anyone want to start a business in the US with these far reaching fees. I am surprised many aren't leaving all together.So...if the fines and court procedures are secret...how do they enforce them? Seems the solution here is to station TV cameras outside of your doors and just not pay the fines. If they're bold enough to place sanctions against you, the PR would be horrific.Pass the fines on to government contracts. NSA wants back doors ... sure, that'll be $5 Trillion dollars. And then use the money to creat an even more secure service. Our government is an abhorrent abomination. What a sick state we are in that a secret police can run a company directly into oblivion for failure to comply with spying on whatever it wants. What happen to the land of the freedom?"
"USA has become worst than third world countries. The day Apple compromises its security practices is the day they lose me as a customer. I wish all giant telecoms and tech companies like Google and MS were as staunch in their stance on customer privacy and encryption as Apple is. As a detractor of Apple I support them here anyway.  Fight the good fight, Apple.Apple may be douchy from time to time but at least they give the gov the fingerFuck all of you at the NSA, you nosey motherfuckers.What if Cook and Apple are all smoke and mirrors? What if they are going along with the back door but want it to look like they are not? "
"Why harm the most valuable company in the world. Apple has 100s of billions of liquid cash. They can actually pay fines. It will give them an enormous brand advantage."
"Usually not a big fan of Apple for their prices and other issues, but this makes me respect them more.This is why I buy Apple. Their prices completely justify not getting snooped by the US Gov. "
"*And* why is it the US Gov? Why not **my** Government?! It's THAT which makes me angry about this. Heck! I even threw away those stupid padlocks with the US Master Key thing, because why should *just* America get access to my personal belongings and not my British government. How paranoid of a country do you need to be to have the need to snoop around into people's stuff?!vote harderHe is not even in the US how the f does he vote for a US party.[deleted]From what I can tell Apple do a damn sight more than Android and Windows."
"I'm not a terrorist, so I won't buy a black phone. I just think it's really intrusive having a foreign government looking at my stuff...[deleted]A black phone is just going to make you look mega-suspect.what's a black phone?Super nerdy phone for the ultra-paranoid. Uses some tech which supposedly stops all forms of spying and such. Yet it runs a form of Android *soooooooo....?*The problem with those options is that they require the people you're connecting with to have the same super rare security measures. iMessage just requires another iPhone, which is pretty common. [deleted]You're custom Android rom protects you,  but not any of your communications, that's what I was talking about. [deleted]Of course  that's an issue, it's an issue for every secure messaging system. Adoption is the biggest hurdle. But, Apple has had the benefit of pushing out iMessage as the default messaging system between millions of iPhones. "
"I don't know much about Hangouts' encryption. But if its encrypted in the same way, Google has done a terrible job of getting that info out there. Not unless Hangouts was updated to add end to end encryption within the past few months."
"http://www.phonearena.com/news/Google-Hangouts-doesnt-use-end-to-end-encryption_id69248Fines. This is all a facade to make it seem like the NSA doesn't have access. We'll find out in a year or two that they still have a backdoor in all of these companies that are  fighting the man. I don't trust any of them.  The problem with this... the way iMessage works, apple doesn't even know what is being transmitted across their servers.  They know the public key, but they don't know the private key.  This is why, if you forget your iCloud password and have to reset it, you lose all your text messages, your device can no longer decrypt them.Why don't all the other multibillion dollar companies have the same stories about them?  Maybe there's something different about Apple?  Conspiracies are fun, but paranoia is tiresome.The fuck? I hope all companies start paying these fines and demonstrate the cost that this type of surveillance is costing on US businesses.The real evil empire"
"All communications should be encrypted, using proper (no back door) techniques, with the user(s) being the only ones who define the encryption keys. Hardly. It would be nice to see some of the guys who can afford it tackling the government on fourth amendment rights..."
"That would be nice to see for a change.If I were them I'd say fuck you, I'm moving the entire company base to Sweden who I'm sure would be glad to have more jobs and the US gov't can eat a dick!> The company was faced with daily fines of $250,000 per day, which would double each month. By month five, Yahoo would have faced fines upwards of the entire U.S. national debt, and then some."
"TIL: the national debt is less than $250 million! So that's good news. So we hand over the few remaining pieces of private information to the government--that's terrible and bullshit."
"What's worse is that the US government keeps getting hacked and/or lets it's ppl run out with unencrypted data."
"This is surrender of all info to the world, not just the US.If I could mark down a reason for the purchase, I'd go buy something on iTunes right now."
"I'm a huge android/PC guy, with no use for Apple, but this is what companies need to be doing.    -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----"

"Bullshit, this is a call for criminals to get lazy.Man, what will they ever do? It's not like they have more money than they could spend in a decade just lying around. I hope they stand up and keep refusing.You know what Apple, feel free to keep doing this and pass along the fines to us.  It's one I'll happily help finance. This is ridiculous. You can't threaten to fine a company because they aren't doing something that is impossible.All I see here is, Apple paying fines because back doors cannot be trusted like the government cannot be trusted.It's against reason, the companies will and interest and the public interest. How can it be possible? And it's being handled in secrecy. Wtf Go on apple! Pay those fines and keep the doors locked.Really want to see these fines in comparison to the HSBC drug cartel money laundering fine and the LIBOR fixing fines.Sealed criminal case in a secret court...... everything is going fine!Apple and my girlfriend both Do you want to convince tech companies to abandon the USA as its HQ? Because this is how you do it. Our government is so corrupt its a wonder we have allies.Im sure Apple will happily pay the fine and continue to not give access to what they dont haveIsn't that extortion?I suggest we file a class-action lawsuit against the federal government."
"I've written my name on 1000 rounds of Freedom, how about you?Everyone I'm here is talking about privacy rights and the role of government, and I'm just here giggling  every time someone says backdoor access.I mean, when you get right down to it, does a pristine company like Apple really seem like an anal kind of gal?If our government is bought and paid for by the rich, the ones to create all these secret courts, and happen to be major share holders in Apple, then fine away. "
"Then maybe once their own draconian corruption and manipulation of laws will hit them in the pocket book. I bet they have half of congress' personal phone numbers on speed dial."
"Watch how quickly those secret courts go away then."
"Say what you want about Apple, the company has many flaws, but they're very openly and strongly on the side of privacy for their users. Apple knows that if it did allow government back doors, people would be lining up - not to buy stuff, but to return stuff. and people who are under contracts wouldn't want another iPhone once the contract expired.Do you want highly profitable tech companies to move out of your country?  This is how you get that done.Man, as much as I'm not a fan of Apple products, I have a lot of respect for them defending their customers. I guess this is where your overpriced money is going.It's a fuking hype to say how safe apple is. It's all bullshit. Wait until u find out there is an backdoor in about 10 months from now. This is eventually going to lead to the government poking around in our shit for no reason Just like when the police stop you without a cause.The American public is too busy voting on polarizing social issues that politicians use as a wedge. As different as George Bush and Barrack Obama can be, they have a lot in common that the general public fails to see. If the U.S. someday becomes a full on totalitarian state, it won't be one parties fault. The people voted for this shit time and time again. But hey, if he's pro life or pro choice, or whatever I think is right, who cares ...My girlfriend refused backdoor access.  Can I fine her?If you ask me, the US got the data a long time ago with an NSL. This is all just a smoke screen to not make the US look bad.Microsoft is pulling the same type of PR stunt."
"Oh yes, but its not really a PR stunt if they're forced to do it."
"I imagine the NSL says something like Give us the data, but continue to play-fight us in the legal system, so that we do not scare people away from American businesses. We'll slowly drop the case after the public moves on.I have a question. How does something like this affect other countries like Canada who sell/manufacture Apple products (or other products).  Does the US still have the ability/jurisdiction to access our data through a backdoor of this sort?Probably, it is like how they wanted to get the emails from Microsoft for servers based in Ireland. The US government seems to want to be able to easily access any data from US based companies.Or.face.time.http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4534082/fbi-data-encryption"
"Something WE have to talk about.   Yeah, I love how they say WE are talking about it.  Aka you try to tell companies and people what to do.Mister Potatohead.. MISTER POTATOHEAD - BACK DOORS are NOT a secret!Weren't we all just against an act to allow corporations to sue governments when government policy impacted profit? What effects does a move like this have if the company could sue the government?One thought I have is that they have only a chance of doing this because Apple is a U.S. company. They couldn't do anything if, .e.g., a Chinese company did the same thing and sold the devices (perhaps through a black market) in the U.S. "
"Of course the other option is simply to use third party apps to do the encryption, which is what anyone who really cares would use. But of course, then they would flag themselves. The whole point of this is that if everyone is using encryption, then there is no flag to point out individual users.It seems having no access to the data yourself is no longer a good reason. I suppose they expect Apple to reengineer their apps to be less secure and include backdoor functionality and forcibly push out updates to everyone to force them to use it."
"I guess the next step is more decentralized protocols, or have a third party add an encryption layer onto someone else's centralized protocol (so that that someone else has no way to add in a backdoor for the gov't).Every tech company has buckled and handed over PII data to the feds.  How can Apple possibly succeed?According to the gubmint, various financial institutions were too big to fail.  Is Apple too big to fine out of existance?Can't we write to our Senators and ask them to stop the fines?Apple executives need to flat out refuse, not pay the fines, then be taken at gun point to prison. Then the politicians responsible would have their careers destroyed by citizens,  or they would change their ways and relent. Either way, the execs get released immediately. they shouldn't be getting fined.  "
"Obama's the one pushing for all this spying too, he's expanded bush policy.Oh dang, they may have to actually dip into the petty cash."
"If the government gets their way, I want the government account to be visible to all iPhone users. And when they access data, the user should be notified. If only they had cash on hand to pay it! Fines for warrant less searches.....Backdoor = ButtrapeSo, anyone wanna buy a Nokia 8110?Apple may not have the keys, but they certainly could be coerced (and likely already have been) into providing a mechanism to get the keys on demand from one of the end devices. Suppose the government imposes the same sort of exponentially increasing sanctions that they did with Yahoo!. They presumably have the ability to compel payment through control of the banking system. Suppose that Apple stands on its principle and stubbornly refuses to comply. All of this, of course, is under a gag order because it is being done by a secret court for secret reasons, so the public doesn't know about it."
"What happens when Apple runs out of money? Do the Apple Stores and online services just close down? Or does the government step in and take over operations? Given that the government will still wish to maintain secrecy, can they release (or force Apple to release) faux financial statements that pretend Apple still has all its money? How far could this sham be carried?[deleted]use a non-company-encumbered linuxThey can write it off as PR expenditures.[I wish I had the last 20 seconds of my life back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEL65gywwHQ)Apple should move out of US.  If Apple doesn't give in here, I'd go back to using their products again.  What I'm really curious about is the supposed vulnerability of Signal.On one hand they can probably pay for the fines from stylus sales alone, on the other hand good on them!Hardly likely as they pride themselves from being a Californian company (and it would also be seen as a sort of *loss* if they did so) - but can they just relocate outside of the jurisdiction of the U.S.?apple is as rich as nazis, whatever fines they incur would be like shooting BB's at a tank. I'm pretty sure that Apple can pay whatever fine the government wants to pay them... In fact, in a few years they'll probably be able to pull a Pablo Escobar and offer to pay down the national debt if only they get special concessions...Bad guys will just eventually move to custom communication apps.I'm sure they can afford the fines. They deserve it for keeping so much money outside the country. I do believe they've got some cash to burn anyway...More than most country's GDPApple has more revenue than all but 19 country's GDP. They don't care. Welcome to Obama's America. But they can afford it so it's cool, right?I miss TrueCrypt ;(Thank you Apple!!I'm just here so I won't get finedSerious question: What happens if they just ignore fines and threats from secret government entities. What could they possibly do? If said entities take action on a large enough scale they'd have to admit their existence or justify their actions to the public.Thank you apple! Fuck the government, thinking they have the right. Every time I read articles like this, I feel betrayed. I feel like I need to take action somehow to stop the invasion of privacy, even if its not my place in society right now.I hope the government tries to force them and Apple simply leaves. Takes themselves and all their revenue to some nation or island with no such laws. Followed by every other major such source of revenue. Then, if we could just go after the traitors plying their skills to the NSA and FBI, we'd be set. "
"The alternative is we lose our rights and privacy, and no other nation allows our tech, costing us horribly in the long run. TIL apple isn't down with analLet them face the fines, their stock holders will take the hit and complain. It's not their fault for doing the right thing.Government has enough data as is to catch terrorists.  This is a power grab to deal with American troublemakers."
"Everything we have don't post 9-11 has been a setup for some future dictator to run roughshod over us.ITT: finally some love for apple :PDoesn't Apple have more money that the US Government?Why can't we have nice things? > The administration pushed for contempt, at which point Yahoo buckled. The company was faced with daily fines of $250,000 per day, which would double each month. By month five, Yahoo would have faced fines upwards of the entire U.S. national debt, and then some."
"I really doubt they would have gone through with that, not with Yahoo and certainly not with Apple (or Google or MS for that matter). This would basically mean that the US government is socializing the biggest company in the world for its refusal the help do something most people are skeptical about."
"This would certainly have far reaching implementations for not only foreign investors but also other companies in the states.Obama can suck a dick."
"-Tim CookSo release the software with the backdoor. Then offer a separate download to patch the hole. The software has the hole as our oppressive govt requires, but people still have the ability to protect themselves. Come on Apple, just a little bit of backdoor action, promise only the tip. as much as I dislike icrap products (they really are crap) I think this could be interesting IF APPLE is willing to go all in and ask for help from the people."
"ie simply refuse to comply and when sanctions come refuse to pay."
"let the government dismantle the company and let the people respond."
"might be very very interesting.My girlfriend usually refuses backdoor access too, but I always get my way. who wants someone to enter in the back door really?Like Lavabit? eli5, seriously... why do these companies still stay in the USA?  They should pack the hell up and go overseas.  How awesome would it be in light of these issues for Apple, Google, etc to announce they are leaving the USA and taking with them 100's of billions of dollars and 100,000's of jobs.  Give the US gov the big middle finger.  Might actually get US citizens riled up for once.Anyone ever get the feeling this is all for show and iMessage is already easily accessed?  Me neither. A game is being played on the public and it's this."
"1. Corporations under US jurisdiction must provide law enforcement access."
"2. Apple's iCloud hack and police tool to download the full contents of iOS devices (otherwise known as Celebgate) became widespread knowledge and they had to restore confidence to sell product."
"3. Apple and the government conspired and Apple plays their part by pretending to fight the government."
"4. Morons believe Apple (or another tech company) is actually on their side and they trust Apple has their back, but the government catches them as the spying really never let up at all."
"5. What is changed of course is the FBI wants 24/7 access to iMessages and not having to go through the NSA to get it. Because this is the current setup, the NSA is telling the FBI when it comes across certain crimes, then they hack/backdoor the device, but that's not good enough for them now, they want the real time data like the NSA is getting."
"[Researchers challenge Apple's claim of unbreakable iMessage encryption](http://www.macworld.com/article/2055640/researchers-challenge-apples-claim-of-unbreakable-imessage-encryption.html)That tinfoil hat looks really dumb on you.The article clearly states that iCloud data is accessible and must be served by court order,  but they're talking about iMessage here which is actually encrypted. iCloud data is *hosted* externally to the phone and is not part of this iMessage business at all. Apple has focused on customer privacy for years and made that very clear. It benefits them very little to give the government access to all of the users, not to mention the Apple employees use the same exact stuff as the consumers (iPhones, iMessage, iCloud) which means then the government would be able to spy on the Apple employees and the business itself for any communication on iOS. Maybe you should actually read and know what you're talking about before posting stupid crap like this. Personally, I'm very skeptical about this whole Apple resisting the U.S. government. Here's why - Apple would never be allowed in China to do what it does without giving the Chinese government *some kind* of backdoor. Microsoft did it, too, and Google chose to leave the country instead of doing that. So why would Apple be so special that the Chinese government would leave alone as an exception?"
"If they gave it to the Chinese government, it's not so unbelievable to think they gave it or will give it to the US government too with a little more pressure, while still maintaining the image that it's fighting for your privacy (an image that would also be in the government's favor).If you can prove that and do a defcon talk you have a netsec job waiting for you but I don't think you can back that up.In the Snowden slides Apple was the last major tech company they said they had access to.  That could very well be from them refusing to cooperate at each step.  It's hard to tell if the Snowden ppt files show collusion, or just when the NSA found an exploit.>  Apple would never be allowed in China to do what it does without giving the Chinese government some kind of backdoor"
"How do you *know* this?>Personally, I'm very skeptical"
"These statements don't generally require evidence... reddit isn't a journal.I don't think he/she is calling into question whether he/she is skeptical. Apple allowed the Chinese government to do a Code Audit to see what actually is in iOS. China's government is more concerned with spying from other countries than a citizen over throwing government."
"In theory(I'm a software guy, not networking), the Chinese government can track what messages are being sent where without the ability to read the messages."
"So if anything, if the Chinese Government allows Apple Pay and iMessage to be used, than iOS is as secure as Apple claims it is(Without the BS buzzwords that is).Google didn't leave the country :/"
"They closed one of their products down in the country. One.> Google chose to leave the country instead of doing that"
"hahahahahahahahaThere's actually a surefire way to completely prevent digital spying: free software, which is basically open source software with no restrictions. The only problem is that people aren't willing to give up a few video games to ensure their digital freedom and that of future generations. If you're still using spyware (e.g. Windows 7/8/10, iOS, Google's online services), you're contributing to this problem.It's a good thing that they can afford to pay fines. Not forever. And if you think they'll just stick around and pay them until they go broke, you're mistaken. They'd pull out of the U.S. before that ever happened. But it's not like a start up where they have to comply to stay alive.If they have any balls, they'll leave the US for good and move to a country that does not suck NSA cock.Pretty sure they prefer great heaping piles of money instead of balls.I would say most would...So... let me get this straight, we can now fine women for not allowing back door access? I invite everyone engaged in the pro-Apple circlejerk to read this article regarding FCC software on all phones:"
"It doesn't matter what Apple does [there is a secondary, uncontrolled operating system on every phone with access to all telephony components](http://osnews.com/story.php/27416/The_second_operating_system_hiding_in_every_mobile_phone), and you're a fool if you think Apple has a way of controlling that."
"Also [this defense conference from 2010](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQqv0v14KKY), which still contain valid exploits using this secondary operating system that can't really be patched if you're controlling the towers:"
"It doesn't matter how tightly Apple/Google/Microsoft closes the lid on their OS, if they have access to a cell phone tower, there are *decades* worth of bugs in the software used to make these devices talk to towers. Additionally, you should probably be a little skeptical of a company *advertising itself* as being pro-consumer, pro-privacy, while handing you closed source encryption implementations. "
"This fine is because the NSA and their ilk want to make it *easier* to get access to your data, not make it possible. You're a fool if you think closed source software is safe from interception. Apple is the largest company in America right now, stop kidding yourself if you can't see through their pro-privacy greenwashing."
"If you want tech privacy, you have to use open technology, and as long as the FCC/ITU controls the radio spec, that's not going to happen. I'm this sounds like a bullshit PR stunt. They pipe communications directly to they NSA. How do we take them seriously?> They pipe communications directly to they NSA"

"Apple finally decides to innovateEveryone should know that Apple will, sooner or later, lose this one. They either go out of business or comply - it's that simple when you're up against the US government."
"It's time to start supporting alternatives that have no centralised control and, hence, don't have an organisation to be strong-armed into compliance."
"Edit: this doesn't mean ditching your beloved iPhones but merely installing and using a different instant message app./r/darknetplan Interesting."
"I would have assumed that Tim Cook loved letting dudes access his back door."
"God damn it, I don't want to like Apple.ZDNet reports that..."
"Stopped reading right there.When FCC demanded less backdoors, I said possibly strongly disagreed by the NSA. Is now the appropriate moment for me to say I said it so?[deleted]Because there is a difference between tax evasion and tax avoidance... Would you like to give the government the power to force you to pay more tax than you legally owe?Think of the fines as a marketing expense. Apple will get so much positive press for this. I guess that $200 billion in cash is finally getting some usage. They'll come down harder on Apple for this than they ever have on oil companies and banks when they destroy the environment and economy."
"That said, this all still feels like a big PR stunt to me anyway.Its not like they pay taxes or anything. Im sure they wont be bothered by it.America is a criminal. If you think the US government can't get into your iPhone, you're very misguided.Getting in is the easy part. Breaking the encryption of over the air traffic like imessages is a whole different thing. So how secure is Linux then? Can we assume they have provided backdoor access like Microsoft and google?Can we even trust that this is true, and not some joint marketing effort?To really fuck with companies and shit, we should all get together and crowdsource a defense fund for Apple just for this case."
"Oh, we got money from reddit for defending personal freedoms?"
"We should do that again!"
"No amount of money will stop a secret ruling in a secret court demanding a secret backdoor, with a hammer waiting over the head of anyone who makes it not a secret.Tizen OS is something Samsung developed to try to get away from Google. Than we come onto personal computers where China made Ubuntu (developed by [Canonical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_%28company%29)) it's official OS to get away from Microsoft and now 10% of PCs shipped globally now run Ubuntu mostly thanks to that. "

"Countries and companies are already taking steps away from American software.   We in the west just don't notice it because it's taking place in the east.Sorry I call BS, PR stunt from Apple, no way the NSA doesn't have a backdoor into any smart phone in existence. Its a huge money maker for large corporations.You obviously must not be a software developer, especially not involved in anything related to servers or communication. It's not some secret underground where everyone has back doors like The Net. No I'm not a software developer, I'm a Sr Software Engineer and I know how easy it is to put in undocumented code into an API. government to Apple hey guys lets make it look like we don't have back door'sIn case you did not already know, this is just PR.Already a back door. This is just to get you upset. Remember that bogus, borderline honeypot story circulating a couple years ago about iMessage being uncrackable by the authorities?"
"This kind of smells the same to me."
"Apple isn't protecting a shooter's iPhone data. They're defending digital privacy | As CEO Tim Cook's open letter to customers stating that Apple would oppose the order points out, the request 'has implications far beyond the legal case at hand'It's called setting a precedent, and complying with the order at a time which is arguably still at an infancy phase for global cloud based technology would set a very dangerous precedent that could have far reaching implications for decades to come."
"I'm also upset at the tragedy that took place, but we can not use tragedy to allow the ends to justify the means.   We have to be better then that. Too bad the precedent is yeah we have a back door, but you can't have it. I would love if they kept iPhones secure all the time but the problem is that part of their pricing strategy means having a black market iPhone that is valuable too. Or we can suck it up and find out information to prevent more events such as thisIt's called protecting your bottom line. Apple is already on a downward trend, they need good publicity like this.What better way then piggybacking on some news like this. Funny how reddit loves pointing out  logical fallacies, but never learned the slippery slope oneThis is the very basis of trading freedom for safety. In the end, you are never truly safe so you sacrifice freedom for nothing.Tell that to the Patriot Act and it's extension!Set aside the precedent this sets for the technology, think about the precedent this sets for the private individual."
"It ultimately comes down to one simple question. "
"How far can the government go to compel a third party that merely has an incidental relationship (manufacturer of the phone) with the suspect in supporting an investigation? "
"It's one thing to ask for a warrant for meta data, or hell any data that Apple might have on it's severs as it pertains to the investigation. It's quite another to ask to them to construct an operating system so they can brute force the password."
"Think of the implications for the private citizen, if you had any kind of interaction with a suspect at any point in time, no matter how minor, you would now be forced to comply with any order forcing you to act as an instrument of government. This is so far removed from merely ordering a witness of a crime to testify."
"In a perfect world yes it would only be this 1 phone this one time. But that's not the world we live in, this would simply set the precedent that any government, federal, state, local, foreign can compel a private person or business, no matter how many degrees of separation, to act in any way that aides their investigation. That's an awful precedent to set and good on Apple for fighting this.I read elsewhere that they have already unlocked 70 phones.  Anyone else know if this is legit?According to Shane Harris of the Daily Beast Apple has unlocked phones for authorities at least 70 times since 2008. Apple doesn't dispute this figure.) "
"http://thebea.st/1Q2ev17Like we did with 9/11, for example.> cloud based technology"
"They can already obtain lawful access to cloud-based data. This case is about data at rest in a particular end-user device.I'm referring to cloud technology and all the associated techniques including security which this includes both of.This has nothing to do with cloud technology, this is regarding whether or not law enforcement should be able to require backdoor access to offline data encrypted on a user's device. The entire concept of cloud technology is irrelevant to this conversation.Patriot ActThis whole thing is getting spun way out of control by all parties involved and as usual, tech journalism isn't helping at all."
"/u/soondot linked to the [actual court request](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/46f8p8/apple_isnt_protecting_a_shooters_iphone_data/d04qgtl), so I won't repost it, but people commenting should read it - it's not long and it's clear most haven't based on what they're posting. Basically they want a custom OS update that would allow them to bypass the incorrect password retry limit. The FBI can't make this custom OS themselves because it has to be signed by Apple for the phone to accept the update. The FBI has said the following would be acceptable:"
"* the software could be made to only work for that particular handset's hardware ID"
"* Apple doesn't have to give the FBI the software - Apple could install the software on Apple's premises and give the FBI access to try and brute force the password. Once they get the data the FBI doesn't want the software (per this court order at least)."
"Now, Apple is correct by saying that this software could easily be reused. It would likely be trivial to swap out hardware IDs in whatever Apple wrote so that's hardly a good defense for why it couldn't be reused. And the fact that *this* court order doesn't actually ask for the software doesn't mean the FBI couldn't get a court order later for the software. So that is also a concern."
"But the thing is to some degree the objections from Apple don't make a whole lot of sense. Apple claims that this exact method would not work on newer handsets - it only works for the specific model the terrorist had because it was an older phone that didn't have the secure enclave. So in theory the precedent this sets shouldn't really matter for very long - if Apple is telling the truth precedent or not on newer iPhones there is nothing they would be able to do to help the FBI brute force the phone. So to some degree there's a little bit of methink they doth protest too much - I wonder if newer phones offer suffer from a similar vulnerability (that you can load firmware signed by Apple onto the phone and it will perform the upgrade without the phone being unlocked via the user's passcode). They screwed up with the older models - the fact that this method would work (Apple has confirmed that it would) is a vulnerability. They allegedly fixed that by adding in the secure enclave, but it's possible they have now realized it could also be exploited in the same way, hence why they really, really don't want this precedent to be set. Because if their encryption really was bulletproof like they claim then precedent or not there's nothing they could do on the newer phones to help unlock them."
"I could see their other concern being that this sets a precedent for the government to be able to force companies to write software for the purposes of accessing something, and that means in theory they could force companies to put in vulnerabilities in the first place, but that (at least in my own opinion) seems like a bit of a stretch based on what is being asked for here and it so far has not really been the argument Apple has put forth.Switching the hardware ID isn't easy when you can't then sign your changed firmware.I kind of had the same reaction as you. I consider myself a strong proponent of encryption and security/privacy but this is a case of something Apple can do without compromising the greater iOS ecosystem (since they don't have to provide the software)."
"I mean sure someone can hack their source control servers and change the hardware ID to make a new iOS build that can be installed anywhere but under that assumption the attacker can make *any* change to iOS anyway since they are in Apple's system."
"In no way is FBI asking for a backdoor that can be installed anywhere else nor did they indicate they would like them to modify iOS devices to have back doors in the future."
"(I kind of feel that a lot of the people on the anti-gov side are sort of technical but haven't really fully thought about what's being asked here, hence the door backdoor being thrown around)> Apple claims that this exact method would not work on newer handsets - it only works for the specific model the terrorist had because it was an older phone that didn't have the secure enclave."
"The secure enclave can be updated via software, which means Apple has every reason to fight this now. Otherwise, once the precedent is set, courts would have no problem ordering them to write new custom OS updates in the future for law enforcement.Updating it via software is fine. Updating via software when the device is still locked is not. If you can do the latter, the device is not secure.Furthermore, the law enforcement is complaining that not being able to get into phones is impeding their job."
"If this were 10, 15, 20+ years ago before smart phone penetration, your job would be do to police work all the same. This just makes it easier for you, which is not necessarily unilaterally a good thing if history is evidence."
"Just because data is condensed into the phone doesn't mean you can't police your way into finding it out through, you know, detective work. Unless he's writing a diary on it, it's not generating data so much as it's storing communication history. Am I wrong?"
"I assume the FBI can use the carrier to get the texts/calls/metadata. What more do you need?"
"This also opens the door to foreign governments who aren't so discrete or surgical in law enforcement to start making demands on Apple/Google/etc.10, 15, 20+ years ago law enforcement could get a legally obtained search warrant to get to a place where they have enough reasonable proof that evidence exists."
"A lot of the slippery slope arguments that are used here would have not allowed search warrants to exist either because that is basically the same as letting law enforcement into your house whenever they want for no reason at all.>Unless he's writing a diary on it, it's not generating data so much as it's storing communication history. Am I wrong?"
"It's possibly recording GPS, *microphone, camera*, and other sensors. There's a lot of potential for abuse."
"You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole."
"You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole."
"They were playing recordings of a NY Police official on NPR complaining about the ~150 iPhones they have lying around which can't be accessed since Apple stepped up encryption. So, since September of 2014 there have been well less than a phone every other day that this type of backdoor would assist at a department in one of the busiest cities in the nation. Seems to me that is drops in the bucket compared to how many people in that jurisdiction are having their phones and data protected by the same software. We don't even know that all those phones would be useful.*Everything* impedes law enforcement these days. Miranda laws impede them, having to get a warrant signed impedes them, limitations on how long you can hold a suspect without cause impedes them, and the inability to track anyone they want anytime they want impedes them. If you can't do the job with the tools you've got, you're not the (wo)man for the job.I think there are some reasonable middle-grounds, I have not read any of what has been going on with the Apple information requests, because frankly everything I read nowadays makes my blood boil."
"But do you not think that some things could be changed to give police more access, but not infringe on our rights? I wouldn't want a backdoor in my phone. But what if my sister got kidnapped, and the police could get a warrant to access her phone? Under supervision, utilize her phone's gps to track them. I understand, with such access comes serious possible malice, and no one trusts the government, for good reason."
"Idk maybe I just wish things were different."
"Edit:I think most of my logic stems from the belief that hard criminals void their right to privacy, and I see digital goods the way I see hard goods. I think he doesn't deserve the right to privacy, but not at the risk of infringing on innocents' rights to privacy, if that helps clarify my clusterfuck of thoughts.That is the point: "
"Agencies that overreach do not get punished. they do not even get budgets slashed. "
"If you could guarantee that every time the agency that got the iphone hack tool used it without a signed warrant, their budget got slashed in half, I would be happier then a mug to grant it to them. I would be extatic. "
"But if there is no actual accountability for overreaches? No public apology? No We are sorry, here are some cat pictures?"
"Then fuck you. "
"Also, a sincere question: IF criminals void their right to privacy, would you agree that law breaking government institutions void their right to recieve funding? "
"And just for the record. If you are a criminal, then yes, I guess your right to privacy is dimished. "
"But if you are a cop, or member of a law enforcement agency, and your process of proving people are criminals is to ssume they are criminals anyways and use the rights established for usage after someone is proven to be a criminal to see if they are a criminal.... "
"Sorry, then I am of the opinion that the right to privacy has to be defended no matter what, because if private data even gets into the hands of law enforcement agencies they are going to loose it anyways. "
"Or, slightly shorter: "
"I have nothing to hide from people that I trust. I actually want to work in some sort of enforcement, I'm working on physique and health first, but I completely agree on the points about assuming someones a criminal, innocent until proven guilty is completely thrown out thanks to some."
"I have plenty to hide, not because I'm a bad person, but because we all have flaws."
"I agree completely that agencies should be held accountable, they infringe on rights, but get no repercussions, which pisses me off, the system is not played, it's manipulated.exactly... and unless we see change in this, if we can be assumed guilty untill proven otherwise, they should be assumed corrupt and incompetent untill proven otherwise. Until we unfuck the police and the govt, that cannot happen. > But do you not think that some things could be changed to give police more access, but not infringe on our rights?"
"Honestly, no. Appealing to emotional what-ifs is a media/government trick. It's not how laws are made or enforced, at least not in a world with any semblance of fairness."
"Hard criminals have already voided their rights to privacy. You're not talking about criminals, you're talking about suspects. In the case of the dead guy, he too has no right to privacy by virtue of being a corpse.What emotional tricks??? Enact Ashley's law today and never again will the police be prevented from accessing a kidnapped child's phone! /sWhat you propose exists - yes, we can track a network device, and as long as that tracking is locked up behind warrants (and *never* made available warrantless), we maintain a balance of privacy & police protection. But forcing a company to build a backdoor into a device sold to the consumer as private and secure... That's the type of thing that will not remain locked up behind warrants. Put a backdoor into a product and it will be abused, period. So it's all back to the backdoor again? Should have known.Forcing them to build it costs resources too. Even if the FBI compensated apple for the production of such a product, that's still consumes apple's engineers and disrupts their road map. Not saying the fbi is doing this currently, but in the future this could be used as leverage against companies to strong arm them out of doing something the government decides it doesn't likeThe problem with what you're saying is you are accusing them of being criminals before you've even proven it. That is how you get innocent peoples rights taken away because They're a terrorist or whatever.Bunch of winy pussies, what happened to classic detective work? Almost like someone meant for it to be that wayLet's get rid of the impedance and create a force of judicial police officers with execution privileges. Damn it.. now I want to watch Dredd.I AM the law!LAAAAHHHHWWWWWWWWW!Yeah. It's a Stallone and Schneider kind of day. Hellooooo, Cursed earth pizzaI prefer the Urban versionSo police officersAw shit, you're rightI feel like this is turning into a political firestorm and everyone is going to staunchly defend their viewpoint. It seems to be creating more and more divide amongst the American people"
"But honestly I'm surprised there are even people defending the government on this one. It really is amazing to see the state of this country in 2016Off topic but you helped me decide the name for [my app I'm working on](http://imgur.com/96VRW07). Just wanted to give you some credit. "
"What's the app about?About the quest of a family friendly cactus >But honestly I'm surprised there are even people defending the government on this one. "
"Why? Apple can unlock the device without risking the unclock of other iphones by creating a firmware for this exact phone only. "
"There is no slippery slope. "
"It's not really any different than a landlord breaking the lock to allow a search. "
"The government is specifically not requesting a general backdoor. Nor is it saying apple has to make sure that apple can unlock phones in the future. The problem is apple didn't properly secure the phone and apple still has the ability to break the encryption. Next time apple should make it truly secure. "
"There is a wide divide indeed.  Informed vs ignorant, idealist vs realist and intelligent vs well... stupid:/"
"And there is a increasingly wider divide between those groups.My biggest concern is that these are our own countrymen. These are our neighbors, their relatives and children. It's like we're battling against each other to try to help the ignorant not sell us all down the river.There is no quick fix.  This problem started a long time ago and took two generations to get where is is now. It will take at least that long to fix and that's only if major changes are made this minute."
"When educating our children lost priority as a principle and became about saving money we were doomed to a regressive future.  Welcome to that future.[You can say that again](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35595840), and it's not even in the USA."
"(The qualification for being given a platform to speak appears to be relative of person killed in terrorist attack).It's kind of interesting that people like Sen. Feinstein are now on the same side of this issue as Fox News and Donald Trump (i.e. government) vs. the epitome of the private sector (Apple).It's almost as if they want to divide and conquer.There are people who will defend the PATRIOT act. It's terrible because those of us who recognize what's going on are marginalized, even though the numbers are growing. It's like the country is completely split and we're all in this weird Mexican standoff that we all pretend isn't happening."
"This certainly is not the highest point in American history. Remember, the government is made of people too. If a person dreamed it up, other people supported it, its now a thing and here we are. People are people. There will always be them vs us mentalities. . .sadlyPeople really need to learn how it works from a technical standpoint.So much this.  To me the crux of the issue is the ignorance of the technical implications.  Hell maybe telling people in terms of nude pics that were hijacked from Apple cloud a couple years ago.  "
"If people were outraged about J Laws nudes getting loose, imagine what would be unlocked if someone got a hold of this iOS backdoor.Actually, the FBI can easily get your icloud data. Easily. "
"This is about data that only exists on the phone. Apple is claiming they don't have to help because they don't have access to the data. There is no backdoor being created though. I understand the tech pretty well and basically they just want to brute force the passcode without being locked out. Backdoor implies a pre-installed shortcut to get around protections, which this isn't."
"The court order also allows the software to be installed in Apple's facilities so it's not like Apple has to hand over the iOS build to the FBI. They just want the info."
"This also doesn't prevent the security minded to use a longer password than 6 digit passcode. This would make it impossible to brute force even by Apple."
"Also Apple has already handed over the iCloud data. It's not like they are against handing data over under court order.There is a backdoor, but it's already installed. The fact that Apple can actually change the firmware is a backdoor. It was a security flaw. Nevertheless the flaw was not there because of the FBI and more because older iPhones didn't have the secure enclaves in the design (https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf). It's also been fixed in later iPhones (anything with A7 or later)."
"Also 6 digit passcodes are by nature really easy to hack, even with iterative hashing since there are only 10000 combinations. There's really nothing you can do about that other than preventing a new firmware to be installed on existing iPhones without unlocking (which as mentioned should be impossible in later phones). E.g. if you had an longer alphanumeric password it would be impossible for Apple to crack it in reasonable times, i.e. no real encryption backdoor."
"It's sad to me, the willingness to open up your life and give up any rights because they cower in fear of a boogeyman.I don't mind people that are willing to open up their own lives.  I have a problem with them wanting to open up other people's lives.  Like so many issues with society, the problem isn't people wanting to live the way they want to live, it's that they want other people to be forced to live the way they want to live.My main worry is that if they make it so that some of our alphabet agencies can get in why can't anyone else do the same thing. That's the worry of many of usLand of the free*"
"Home of the brave*That's how many pro-gun activists have felt about the last few decades. It's not a fight that's going to end on any fronts soon, or easily. The if you have nothing to fear argument is insidious in its simplicity. It takes a bit of thinking to realize that there are plenty of normal things people do where privacy is justified. Starting a business? Your competitive advantage might not be something people are paying attention to and thus should be kept quiet. At the end of the day, as long as you are not inhibiting someone else's freedoms, you should be able to use your discretion to act, and not have to worry about intervention from your government or your peers.What if you don't want you identity stolen?It's actually a bit pathetic that that they are exploiting this case to push the agenda of backdoors into encryption.  Well since the FBI is a law enforcement agency and they are seeking a way to get data off this cell phone and Apple is denying this, they are in fact protecting this shooter, as well as future shooters the FBI will no doubt like to investigate. How terrible would it be for the FBI to have more resources to do their job.> they are seeking a way to get data off this cell phone and Apple is denying this"
"No, Apple is denying them access to a custom written operating system designed solely to strip privacy away from their customers. There is a large difference and the FBI is WAY out of line here trying to force it."
"Denying law enforcement's illegal requests is not protecting shooters and you are incorrect to try to frame it that way. It's an appeal to emotion and proves how little you know about the actual situation since there's not even any real proof the cellphone holds unique data they can't gather elsewhere."
"This is just the FBI trying to overreach and not do the leg work to track down the information through other channels. They have access to more information than ever these days but if they don't have everything it's apparently not enough which is total bullshit.Who is they?Goku and Krillin, man, who else?How are they pushing *backdoor* into *encryption*?"
"Backdoor means a pre-installed shortcut for certain parties to get around protections. Given this is install post-encryption it's a hacking tool, not a backdoor."
"Also the attack is on the OS level protection not *encryption* itself. Apple is not asked to modify all future iOS devices to make them easier to crack (in fact on the current generation iPhones this attack isn't possible). Given they want to crack this via brute force it's not like they are bypassing the encryption. It just so happened that older iPhones have this vulnerability with simple pass codes and they are asked to exploit it."
"Being asked to exploit a known vulnerability is different from introducing back doors intentionally.Sadly, I've heard remarks against Apple horse hindering the case.  Our society is so short sighted in so many ways.It's sad how the govt and politicians exploit any tragedy for their own gain. The anti-gun folks do the same thing with mass shootings, anti-drug folks do it with major drug busts.. This isn't a new thing. Hell, the pro gun folks are starting to exploit mass shootings. If everyone had a gun pointed at everyone else all the time, this tragedy would not have happened, and we would all be safer.Weren't there literally dozens and dozens of unencrypted red flags they missed anyways?They did it immediately after a bunch of people were gunned down in cold blood in Paris. They didn't even wait to them to be buried before using it as [another excuse for backdoors.](http://www.wired.com/2015/11/paris-attacks-cia-director-john-brennan-what-he-gets-wrong-about-encryption-backdoors/)"
">US official explained to the Post that the government had not yet succeeded in persuading the public that encryption is a problem because [w]e do not have the perfect example where you have the dead child or a terrorist act to point to, and that's what people seem to claim you have to have."
"Inhuman scum.See, people? This is why we have conspiracy theories. And not nice things.Didn't it turn out that the Paris attackers didn't even use a secure messaging service? Standard SMS, wasn't it?Yep. Where's our ROI on all that massive national security apparatus we've built? Yep. Standard unencrypted SMS."
"Not PSN, like some news networks would have you think."
"Guys, it's all good. John McAfee is going to socially engineer his way into the phone with his team for free!I thought he was too busy having a ton of sex initiated by looks from his wife in any place and at any time.Sweet talking Siri doesn't work. I know the FBI, and the government more generally, doesn't give a flying fuck about privacy, but how can they still not see that crippling encryption will harm the US economically?I replied elsewhere but FBI isn't trying to get Apple to weaken their encryption though. This is on an older iPhone with a vulnerability that it can be brute forced and unlocked (if it has simple pass codes). It's not like Apple is asked to weaken security on all future iPhones."
"If anything this is a design flaw on the iPhone 5c and older phones."
"Not saying FBI/NSA hasn't tried to weaken encryption in other areas by introducing back doors to software but this isn't one of them.They can't care. In the same way that a burger flipper can't care about the obesity epidemic. The economic well being of the US doesn't matter to them so much as enforcing law. We can change them by changing the relevant laws. Right, I meant their masters, not the FBI themselves.Any Congress member who speaks out against this can have the challenge of X called off the FBI from investigating terrorism! levied at them during their next election cycle.The same way they didn't see milti-billion dollar bailouts & ZIRP policies would decimate the economy.In what world did the *bailouts* ruin the economy?  The economy was already on a spiral downward.  Just read /u/Dain42's comment.> milti-billion dollar bailouts [...] would decimate the economy"
"I'm no supporter of big banks, and I think we need much better, stronger, harsher financial regulation than we do."
"But without the bailouts and TARP, the economy most likely would have actually, literally been decimated. Letting the banks fail would have been fun and cathartic for *maybe* a few hours, but it would almost certainly have taken most or all of the global financial system along with it, and that would have been completely disastrous to everyone, from workers right on up. Our economy and our whole way of life that we're used to completely depends on the proper functioning of the financial system."
"If you want to get into some really good in-depth reporting, you should check out the series of shows *This American Life* did in collaboration with NPR over the course of about 3 years, all about the financial crash. This collaboration has continued in the form of [Planet Money](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/), which has evolved from down-to-the-minute reporting in the aftermath of the financial crash of 2008 to being a really interesting general economics show. I'm pretty sure that episode 365, Another Frightening Show About the Economy is the one that deals most directly with some of the consequences of even minor failures in the financial system, but many of them touch on it."

Never heard of either of those programs, took a look at their site and looks like good stuff.  Looking forward to checking these out.I'm quite happy to share! *This American Life* is one of my favorite shows on TV or radio, and it's one of the few podcasts where I actually usually sit down and devote my undivided attention. I've been listening for almost a decade, now. They don't only do serious journalism, but when they do, it tends to be absolutely superb. Like their [two](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/562/the-problem-we-all-live-with) part [episode](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/562/the-problem-we-all-live-with) about the current, *very* segregated state of our schools, and their Peabody Award winning episode about Guantanamo, [Habeas Schmabeas](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/310/habeas-schmabeas)."
"They do a lot of very personal stories about individual people, ideas, and experiences, too.

[Numbers](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/88/numbers) is also a really good episode, in my opinion."
"I'll stop linking there, because I could go on and on, and I probably already got carried away.I don't think they really give a fuck about the bailouts. The same people who own the country are the ones who got paid after all.Yes indeedy, the american people own the country and we did get paid."

Oh wait, it did the opposite.I couldn't believe when I read some comments quoting Apple as harvesting/helping terrorism.  People saying they will never purchase another Apple product, etc..."
"Since when did citizens start demanding government access to personal data?  Citizens caught up in fear (again) to justify yet more freedoms taken away in the name of public safety.  It isn't enough the NSA records all phone messages and text messages, now users are lambasting Apple for standing up and saying enough is enough.> to justify yet more freedoms taken away in the name of public safety."
"For me, it's not even about that. Encryption is all or nothing. You CAN'T HAVE a backdoor because that would defeat the purpose of encryption completely. If a backdoor exists, people WILL find it. It's not a matter of if they find it but when. I have yet to read a single comment like the one you are talking about. All I have seen is people objecting to comments I can't seem to find... http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3450382/Judge-Apple-help-US-hack-San-Bernardino-killers-phone.html"
"Almost every commentI'm just waiting for all the old people to die. It really seems like the blind support for this shit is coming from a lot of people who don't know how the technology already works. If they really knew what the Patriot Act was all about (the name is a god damn insult) and especially how article 215 worked, I really don't think they would be so keen on letting these government agencies have free and unlimited access to our phone's data.It doesn't help that Donal Trump, who has a pretty fervent following, went on to say yesterday how bad it is for Apple to not assist law enforcement. From yesterday:"
"I think it's disgraceful that Apple is not helping on that.  I think security first and I feel -- I always felt security first.  Apple should absolutely -- we should force them to do it.  We should do whatever we have to do and I guess he wants to be a good liberal and he doesn't want to give the information. "
"But we -- on that -- as an example, those two people killed 14 people.  There were other people that saw the bombs laying all over the flu system (ph) like a normal apartment.  You had bombs laying all over the floor.  You had all sorts of ammunition.  You had all sorts of everything in that apartment. "
"People knew that.  I'd like to know who else knew it because they're almost as guilty and maybe just as guilty.  I think you have to be able to correct that and I think Apple is absolutely in the wrong.Using fear to take away liberties.  It is amazing how people forget this."
"How the fuck can people who claim to be conservative, be demanding a corporation violate our rights, in order to help the federal government?!"
"It's like we're living in bizarro world.>How the fuck can people who claim to be conservative, be demanding a corporation violate our rights, in order to help the federal government?!"
"Because there is no violation of anyone's rights. You have the freedom from unreasonable search and seizure. This phone was seized from a guy who went on a shooting rampage. The ability to search this phone is the most reasonable search you can even imagine. "
"There is no credible argument that searching this phone is an invasion of privacy. "
"There is some argument that forcing apple to defeat their own security is bad. I'd certainly be against forcing apple to break all their encryption. "
"But the court is asking Apple to break the encryption on one single device. A device the government has every right to search. "
"Apple is claiming this sets a bad precedent, but I just don't see it. It is strange that many people who claim to stand for small government would also say give them all the access they need to stop bad guys.It's been bizzaro world for quite some time now. What really baffles me is that some people out there believe that letting the government crack iPhone encryption will make us safer."
"The only way it could be argued that it **might** make anybody safer is if they preemptively snooped through your crap in an effort to figure out who's planning an attack. And even then you'd have to be a real idiot to think they'd be able to sort through that load of shit and come up with anything useful. Hell, the NSA certainly didn't stop the San Bernardino attack."
"I just don't understand how people are so willing to throw away their privacy. Even if the government was genuinely trying to protect us (who the fuck still believes that?), who the hell can possibly be OK with doing it that way?Think of the information that you *might* get from the phone of these people though? I bet the congressional hearing that starred the report would be a blockbuster.Lets argue the other way for them. "
"Would you be willing to hand this I-phone cracking tool to North korea? "
"Because they can as well produce an officially signed court order to ask them to help defend the countries security by installing a backdoor into iphones that forces the phone to open up. "
"So, by installing this for the US, apple would allow north korea, china, iran, irak, the french, russia and many others to point to the abailability of this kit and go, we can launch similar demands, from anything like the iranian moral police requesting apple to decrypt the phones of suspected unreligious western people to north koreans asking to have apple unencrypt the phones of suspected spies. "
"So, would you support the request of the US government if it means the chinese get the capability to read your phones contents if they find a judge who signs the warrent?When you release a backdoor 'kit', you can bet it will either fall into the hands of hackers to put up on the web and/or be reverse engineered to figure out how the backdoor works.Everyone knows how AES works, that doesn't mean you can break it. The same goes for backdoors. It depends on what kind of backdoor and how it is implemented. well, lets think of it like that: "
"As far as I understood it, all they want to have is have their code signed by apple. "
"So, my question is simple... how difficult is it to remove a key from a chain of trust? "
"Like, lets say, I am apple, and I want to sign your app candyland for exactly the 15 minutes that you say you need it signed. Can I create a special key for it that only works for 15 minutes, and after that never more? "
"Because as far as I remember, with certificate authorities and the likes, it seems to be able to remove certs from the hong kong post poffice from your servers, and such. Therefore, just asking : "
"did I understnd the question right? "
"Would my solution actually be practicable? "
"Could it be done in the way I described it?Yes something like that could be done, at least on the activation server level. Hell, not thrilled either, but I revolt against the presumption that this can not be done one time and securely. All you have to do is use game theory. "
"for example: "
"Say the police department wants to decrypt phone A. "
"Now, with a signed warrent, The police department goes to the agency, that uses all of the old zero days. "
"It picks out a zero da, and demonstrates it to the apple lawyer team. "
"After the apple team has verified that it is a zero day, They give their shit to it. "
"The passcode for the one time usage of the server with the decryption program? The fix ID for the bug, plus the warrent number. "
"This way, the FBI / NSA / CIA helps apple out and gets rid of their zero days, of which they have too much, but only a limited number. Apple in turn gets more secure for each zero day they change in. Plus, if you post the used passcodes to the system, after the harddrive has been whiped, you both have a way of publically announcing how many zero days have gotten rid off, and how much snooping the government does. "
"Result? "
"- it is guaranteed that apple phones get less bugs ( after all, if the givernment has to use up a zero day for every phone unlock, it gets pricey very quick, and I trust the apple engineers to be able to fix zero days that are known to them)"
"- it keeps the FBI/NSA/ect in check. "
"- it gives the decryption requests an opportunity cost, that makes it very hard for anyone to abuse their shit too much. "
"I mean, heck, what you are looking for is an encrypted one time connection, with an ideally one time passwoird, that allows them to brute force the phone open. Plus, the same judges that will sign Our three letter agencies must have the abilitioes to decrypt the phones will also sign people and companies helping the LEO's should get compensation"
"yes all certs are issued with a Not After/Not before expiry but you are at the mercy of that application to honor the expiry.  Many services have a ignore expiry on certs... That also seems to be a big concern in Tim Cook's open letter. Security through obscurity is certainly not the way to go (and large tech companies never rely on that), but you still don't want to help people figure out how to break into your OS by giving them examples.I have nothing to hide.I used to be like that. It's so fucking creepy now that I think about it. I don't need strangers knowing all this stuff about me.That triggers me so bad I wanna down vote your comment, but Don't shoot the messenger.That one makes my blood boil.> Since when did citizens start demanding government access to personal data?"
"*Subpoena duces tecum* likely go back to the Roman legal system. *Writs of mandamus* may only go back to Edward II, but in the US, such capability was put into law in the first session of the first Congress, because it was believed to be an important tool for a functioning justice system.Wouldn't it be funny if after all this the passcode was just 1-2-3-4.1-2-3-4^^-5?! that's what I have on my luggage. Have those people even read and made an attempt to understand what Tim Cook tried to explain? Apple can't provide that solution for the one phone. If they provide it, it has the potential of being used on **any** iPhone, and you'd have to be really gullible to think that they'll use it only for the one iPhone."
"Once a software solution is out there to crack that phone, it can and will be applied any time they want to look at the encrypted data on an iPhone."
"I'm sick and tired of the think of the children! type of argument that's constantly used by people who don't see any problems with the lost of liberties and privacy. Anybody who really argues that Apple should give the FBI what they're asking for clearly doesn't have enough of a grasp on the situation to understand what it entails and shouldn't be allowed to make decisions for themselves.Actually... side check.... "
"Lets say apple signs the iphone version with a special key that is valid for only 10 minutes, then the key gets taken out of the chain of trust? "
"Hell, if you want to, have only one server host the special key, and have only one PC be able to connect to that server. "
"As soon as two or more PC's connect, the server removes itself from apples chain of trust, and revokes the certifficate. Then, the server gets taken out, and gets smashed, and what not. "
"- it would work only for the one device, in a timeframe they could controll. "
"- They could do it with 2 updates in a kilobyte range. "
"- if possible, they could let the Feds sign an EULA stating that they agree to guard the method well, and if this method is found to be exploited in the wild, or without a valid warrant, any and all cooperation in the programm will immediatelly cease because it can be assumed that the neccesary files were handed from the signer of the eula to some other person, and would only resume after a valid warrent has been handed to apple central. "
"Would that be able to guarantee that this would only be one time?>Lets say apple signs the iphone version with a special key that is valid for only 10 minutes, then the key gets taken out of the chain of trust?"
"How do you suggest the key gets removed? If someone captures it while it's on the wire then you might have a vulnerability to replay attacks. If it's dependent on the system clock of the device then that is not too hard to spoof if you have physical access and an accurate board diagram."
"The current protection relies on the data being total gibberish until it's combined with the correct modifications that turn it into useful data. Once that modification is done, there isn't really a good way to prevent it from being done again. Quantum cryptography is able to create keys which are destroyed by nature of using them but that's using some funky physics which aren't applicable here."
">if possible, they could let the Feds sign an EULA stating that they agree to guard the method well, and if this method is found to be exploited in the wild, or without a valid warrant, any and all cooperation in the programm will immediatelly cease because it can be assumed that the neccesary files were handed from the signer of the eula to some other person, and would only resume after a valid warrent has been handed to apple central."
"This would be totally worthless. The standard response from the US Govt. regarding these forms of tech are prove it was used against you which then turns into all information that could be used as proof is related to national security, go away now. "
"The stingray, for example, had been used for years by local police and any suspects who got nabbed by it had no recourse to legally challenge it because there was no visible evidence of its use despite literally being a radio tower. "
"Why do you think they would handle software any more responsibly when it's even harder to get caught using it illegally?I'm guessing that if Apple had *any* way to comply with the FBI without compromising the rest of their products, they'd do it. Publicly taking on the FBI in the privacy v security debate scores Apple points here on Reddit, but it could seriously hurt in the business world. No, Apple's doing this because there's no other way, I believe. And I commend them for it.The real problem is how major news outlets are reporting it. CNN, ABC World News, and our local news station all had reported how Apple is putting us at risk by protecting terrorists privacy, and placing their needs and rights above ours. "
"The actual story of what happened was never reported. There was no mention of how our Government asked for what could basically be our undoing in terms of digital privacy. They have all made it seem like Apple and Tim Cook don't want to cooperate with the FBI. They did, and they had provided them with the data needed for the investigation. What they didn't do is fulfill their requests to make a virtual master key for their products so that our data is available o anyone and everyone who has access to it. "
"As an apple customer, I'm very pleased with Tim's decision to oppose this kind of action. They are going toe to toe with one of the biggest and most powerful entities in the world, and it's certainly not easy to be in the position they are in now. I'm glad that my rights to privacy are respected by somebody, when I that they won't be by my own government. Why can't the FBI send apple the Phone with a search warrant. Apple will then unlock it and send the FBI its contents. Straightforward, no? That's literally what the FBI asked for.No, the simple answer is 'no.' It's not straightforward and Apple cannot just 'unlock it and send' it back. Apple purposefully designed it so that it's outside of their own access.Because Apple can't unlock it. They'd have to build something first."
"Apple can only really provide data from iCloud - but anything on your device is secure. > Because Apple can't unlock it. They'd have to build something first."
"So in other words...they *can* unlock it. "
"I think his question was, why can't Apple simply access disclose the data on that phone? Why does the FBI need to capability the open each and every iPhone when all they need in this instance is the data from a single phone?> So in other words...they can unlock it."
"They *cannot* unlock it with current technology. They'd need to develop a new product to try to unlock it. Not even Apple has the ability to do this. There are systems in place on the phone that would need to be dismantled via a master key, and that means that Apple would need to break encryption for all phones. Encryption is math and making a hole for one group means leaving that hole for everyone. No, they can't unlock it. They can potentially unlock it in the future by creating a weakened version of their own product. Apple is worried that doing so will enable nefarious misuses of this weakened version in the future, and that it will set a bad precedent for future counterterrorism activities.    ios-update.sh /dev/ttyS2 ~/cracked-ios/build/main.bin"

"
"I just saw a journalist on CNBC say Apple made the encryption this difficult, they should have not done that Even worse it was their programming called Squawk Alley..(cause Sillicon Valley get it haha!!) "
"which prides itself in covering in depth about everything tech. The media is called [The Fourth Branch of the Government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_branch_of_government) for a reason."
"See also the [Fourth Estate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Estate).I was disappointed this morning when NPR interviewed a former government security analyst who kept deriding Apple and they offered no counterpoint. Absolutely no understanding of how encryption works or how software development works. Let's how that journalist feels if weak encryptions caused his messages and photos to be leaked to the public This whole encryption discussion in the media that's been happening for the last few months is both super hilarious and scary. A bunch of old people who don't have a clue about encryption who think that it's possible to weaken it so that the good guys can access data while simultaneously keeping the same level of safety against the bad guys."
"Not sure what else I was expecting, coming from people who think describing the Internet as a series of tubes that sometimes get clogged is a good analogy.There is an unfortunate number of both liberals and conservatives who are entirely for giving up privacy on the internet and digital devices. This is coupled with mainstream news outlets becoming cesspools of bias and pandering. Some insist it's just old people, but even liberal geek icons like Wil Wheaton want to remove privacy from the internet because security.If asked to build a logic gate, Judge Sheri Pym would likely show up with lumber and nails. Did they try swipe right then down?A backdoor will put ALL iphone users at risk. Can someone explain what the difference from them searching a home with a warrant and unlocking your phone to look at info is without devolving it to an ethics concern?Tim Cook says it all in his open letter. Providing a solution like what the FBI wants for this particular case **cannot** be done as a one-time thing. Once the solution exists, it exists. It can and will (you'd have to be naive) be used on other phones. You'd have to be naive to think it won't be abused."
"The search warrant for a home equivalent would be to say that every door is locked and indestructible and the only way the FBI can get into a home is with a search warrant. Except in this case, if you emit one search warrant for the FBI for a particular home, it also gives them access to every home in the future without a search warrant. They can swear they'll only open doors when they have search warrants, but a lot of people (including me) call bullshit."
"The search warrant for a home isn't a very good analogy because to make it the equivalent of what they want to do with Apple you have to set a bunch of parameters (ie: access to every door without a warrant) in a way that doesn't make sense in the real world.This was the ethics concern I meant.  :p  They can search homes without a warrant now.  Not legally of course, but they can and do.  So how would searching a phone (which should and does require a warrant) be much different?Because police already know how to knock down doors, but not break open iPhones. Let's not give them that.I guess it wouldn't be too different. But in this case it's still preventable because the solution the FBI wants Apple to create doesn't exist yet. It comes down to how would this be any more evil than that other evil thing we do that already exists?. We can't stop them from conducting searches of our homes without warrants, but we can still prevent the tool that would allow them to do the same thing for our phones from being created.> So how would searching a phone (which should and does require a warranty) be much different?"
"Because as of right now they cant abuse this the way that you suggested they abuse physical searches.  Once they have the key they can.  This is forcing the businesses that produce the locks to your house, to give the FBI a master key. The main issue is that they aren't simply wanting access to the device, they want Apple to build them a custom operating system that will allow them to access ANY Apple device by bypassing a lot of the most important security measures."
"This special version of the OS will remove the time-out and lock-out that occurs when the incorrect passcode has been entered too many times, this is one of the most important security features of the iPhone and without it the encryption is all but meaningless."
"Without this lock-out period and without the device being disabled with too many incorrect inputs the FBI will be able to brute-force ANY passcode on ANY Apple device by systematically going through ALL passcodes because they will no longer be locked out from the device due to incorrect inputs."
"This is the sort of tool that we see at first being used correctly then it is used for more trivial and trivial issues, as soon as you turn your back it's all of a sudden used at every opportunity by every local PD and law enforcement for anything as long as there is a cell phone nearby."
"Although they promise that it will only be used this once it's pretty obvious that if the government had this capability they certainly wouldn't let it go, you just have to look at the Patriot Act and how it's being completely twisted into a tool where the government can do whatever they want."
"It's a VERY dangerous precedent to set.And they (FBI), and a lot of reverse engineers could do this in a week. The asking Apple to do it for them is odd. If my life depended on breaking a 4 digit pass code that is the key to encryption on a16gb NAND flash drive soldered to a board, I think I could probably get it cracked in a few weeks. Desoldering it without damage and finding a compatible controller would be the tough part."
"That or pay SK Hynix in South Korea who built the flash drive to do it for me."
"Anyone else wondering if this is a feint? Maybe LE just wants the world to think they can't get into this.> If my life depended on breaking a 4 digit pass code that is the key to encryption on a16gb NAND flash drive soldered to a board, I think I could probably get it cracked in a few weeks."
"You would die.It's because they don't care about this specific device -- they want the precedent set for the future. They're taking advantage of the case and the timing and the current political climate to gain additional power.Nope and nope."
"The firmware won't run unless signed by Apple."
"You have to brute force the passcode on the device itself due to the hardware based key that is almost impossible to extract> Without this lock-out period and without the device being disabled with too many incorrect inputs the FBI will be able to brute-force ANY passcode on ANY Apple device by systematically going through ALL passcodes because they will no longer be locked out from the device due to incorrect inputs.  "
"I mean... if you wanted to brute force, you have the hardware; just desolder the chip from the phone, make duplicate copies of the data that is on it and throw a bunch of computers at the data."
"Getting data off memory chips is not exactly a black art, but the encrypted data contained therein could technically be brute forced without the need for a the user pin code.  I don't know how this would be construed in the court of law though since you are disassembling the device and it could be argued that what you are doing corrupted the evidence.>they want Apple to build them a custom operating system that will allow them to access ANY Apple device by bypassing a lot of the most important security measures."
"Negative. Their court filing even specifies that they just want help with this one device. They provide stipulations so that Apple may sign the software thusly. "

"EDIT: Why are facts being downvoted? The post I replied to said access to ANY Apple device. The FBI hasn't asked for that, and this specific ask wouldn't apply to anything other than the 5C. Once this software is written, it will be able to bypass any Apple device by nature of how it works. There isn't a way to create the software to only work for one specific iPhone since the binary is signed with a common private key. The first bootloader section checks that the next is signed correctly and then loads it, the loaded section does the same for a few more stages until you get all the way to the iOS kernel but the signing key is the same for different devices."
"If each binary was signed with a different key per device then this is something that could technically be possible but it would also prevent you from being able to restore your iPhone from any iOS installation image that isn't linked to your device. This is not how the system currently works so it's a moot point anyway but that's the reasoning why."

"It's not universal. It won't work with any other device except the 5C even if the signing to that hardware doesn't pan out. The design of the 5S, 6, 6S preclude what you're talking about. "
">You may assume that the word subject here is legally binding to one incident. It's not. You could one day also be the subject."
"Perhaps. I imagine if I was the FBI would have a search warrant for my phone and I was, for whatever reason, unable to be compelled to present the passcode. Like being dead. Which would make the whole effort seem reasonable. Just like now. With the dangerous precedent set in that they are able to order manufacturers to do such a thing do you seriously think it will stop at one device?"
"Of course it won't.> With the dangerous precedent set in that they are able to order manufacturers to do such a thing do you seriously think it will stop at one device?"
"There is a legal justification for accessing the device. He and his wife killed 14, injured 22 others, and the FBI is investigating whether Tashfeen Malik and Syed Farook were radicalized, supplied or otherwise supported by others. "
"He turned off iCould syncing a month before the attack took place, so the FBI doesn't have backups to access instead. Syed Farook can't provide the passcode to the phone because he's dead. San Bernardino can't unlock the phone. The whole thing seems incredibly reasonable to me. There is a very good reason for the FBI to have access to the phone. "
"The entire thing, to me, seems like Apple's attempt at getting out of the business of unlocking iPhones. They've been denying the bereaved for years. "
"> There is a very good reason for the FBI to have access to the phone."
"But no reason whatsoever to force a company to build a new product that doesn't exist. > But no reason whatsoever to force a company to build a new product that doesn't exist."
"Apparently there is a reason. "
"New ground legally and technologically. Apple designed the phone to be secure, the FBI has a compelling legal justification for accessing it, the owner can't help and the user is dead.

Once this pandora's box is open there is no way to close it again. Not just that, but the govt compelling a company to write a piece of software that doesn't exist, so they can spy on people?  That's Orwellian shit right there."
"Forcing a company to hand over something they don't want to is bad enough; forcing them to *build* something and then hand it over is a thousand times worse.Those who sacrifice freedom for security, deserve neither. Pick the lock, cut it open with a warrant now.If a deal can be made with Iran then one can be made with AppleThose who break the law lose their right to privacy, I get that... The issue is you're not taking away the criminals privacy, you're taking away everyone's. We'd be one step closer to 1985 So wait...they've done it before but *now* they're taking a stand?Interestingly enough, I have not actually seen ANYBODY claim that Apple is defending the shooter. In fairness, I have to admit, I tend not to read the news sources that would be most likely to make that claim though.Is code not a form of speech?   How is requiring Apple to write something against their will not a violation of the 1st amendment?I fucking *hate* Apple with every fiber of my being because of their dated hardware and how they phase products out."
"But this, this right here is how you're supposed to do things.> They are defending digital privacy."
"OK. But most of all THEY ARE DEFENDING THEIR PRODUCT AND THEIR MARKET. Why did they previously unlock phones 70 times?!!I have a technical question about the nature of what the FBI wants.  On NPR this morning they suggested that the FBI wanted Apple to deactivate the retry counter, essentially letting the FBI try as many passwords as they want.  If this is true, then they aren't asking for apple to break the encryption.  Anyone know if this is correct?Comes down to the same thing. If they provide a way of disabling the password attempt counter for that phone, then they potentially provide it for any phone in the future. If you can brute force a phone in a few seconds, the result is the exact same thing, even if the encryption is technically not broken.True, but the difference is that the damage is not as far reaching.  It won't affect your online banking security, for example.Not sure I follow what you're saying."
"If apple just breaks encryption on their phone so that it can eventually be decrypted by the FBI (or another third party with the right tools), they get access to the encrypted data on your phone. If Apple provides a way to brute-force the password and access the encrypted data on the phone through the user interface, they get access the same way the owner of the phone would access the data."
"I'm not sure how either one of these options compromises online banking security."
"We're not talking about messing with the way iOS implements TLS or any of that stuff. the FBI wants a way to access the data on the phone, not a way to decrypt HTTPS traffic...They are asking Apple to write a version of iOS that will allow them to brute force the phone and then force-update that phone to that version of iOS.  So they can then, brute force it.That's different than asking Apple to break encryption which is what I thought it was.  Encryption doesn't rely on retry locks to work but it does rely on good (preferably  long) passwords or you are susceptible to a brute force attack.  They are asking for a secondary feature to be deactivated.  I'm still siding with Apple because of the precedent issue but I think it's important to be clear about what the discussion is about and I think the media hasn't been doing a good job there.>That's different than asking Apple to break encryption "
"You're arguing meaningless semantics. They are giving the FBI the means to break the encryption for all iPhones by bypassing security features. Most people would refer to that as simply breaking encryption because it makes the encryption next to worthless, or broken.This allows them to instantly break into the phone of everyone who uses, say, a 4 digit passcode. That's still a lot of people.well if they physically have your phone right?The specific software required from apple should they comply requires the ability to brute force via wifi too, but presumably it still needs to be installed on your phone. That being said, what's stopping it from being installed on your phone over the internet - it'd be an Apple-signed firmware update, the phone would accept it.The FBI wants a new OS that would load onto the phone without wiping it, and that would remove the retry counter so that they could use a brute force attack. See the text of the court order here: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2714001-SB-Shooter-Order-Compelling-Apple-Asst-iPhone.htmlIndeed. This could then be used on any device. Not just that one. Basically they're asking for the ability to break the encryption, not remove it entirely. The encryption is tied to a device-unique code and the passcode. The phone locks you out after a few incorrect guesses. It's impossible to get that data without this passcode; brute force will get them the code eventually, but they're asking Apple to rewrite the OS to allow them to brute force without locking them out. "
"Either way, they're asking for the ability to make a nigh-on-entirely secure device vulnerable. Which has much broader implications than law enforcement, including increasing the possibility of the scary evil terrorists of being able to break into U.S. Citizens' devices from absolute zero to not zero."
"If everyone realized this, this wouldn't even be a debate.Well if we treat a phone like another piece of property like a house, law enforcement doesn't give up searching your home when the doors locked. I have no issue with them breaking down your door if they have a warrant."
">  I have no issue with them breaking down your door if they have a warrant."
"Would you have an issue with the government forcing the home builder to install a new entrance?"
"The FBI can do whatever it wants to the shooters phone. Nobody has a problem with that."
"What I have a problem with is the FBI ordering Apple to build a new operating system with weakened security. I don't believe they have the authority to do that. Except even a house isn't a piece of property. Different rules apply to searching your car, your house or your personal belongings dependent on if they are in your possession or not."
"I'd be inclined to set a precedent where a phone's data isn't property but that's a whole other argument.I really like that point, honestly. The only issue I have it's it's a lot easier to sneak into a phone than a house without causing a scene. It's not quite the same thing, though. "
"Let's use an example of the police searching a home and finding a locked safe. Yes, they could attempt to break into the safe, pick the lock, cut it open with a blowtorch, etc. "
"But let's say that safe has a self-destruct mechanism of some kind. Cut it with a torch and the contents are destroyed. Pick the lock, the contents are destroyed, etc. "
"What the FBI is asking Apple for would be the equivalent of going to the Safe manufacture and asking for a master key. When the manufacture says Oh, we don't have a master key, that's the whole point., the FBI then says Ok, fine, then we want you to spend time and resources to BUILD a master key that will open this safe, even though one doesn't exist now. "
"So, the government is attempting to compel a private corporation to build a thing that doesn't exist (and it doesn't exist because it can't exist, otherwise it would make the safe rather pointless). Even if *this time*, the master key doesn't get abused, the fact that there's a precedent for compelling a private company to build something that doesn't exist is bad. I'd just like to let you know that you have the most informative post in this thread. I understand the issue now. There's a lot of oh the gov is taking our freedom away! Without any real understanding of how or why.> Oh, we don't have a master key, that's the whole point., the FBI then says Ok, fine, then we want you to spend time and resources to BUILD a master key that will open this safe, even though one doesn't exist no"
"Don't forget the we won't ever use it on another device or let some incompetent make a copy to sell, pinky swear teehee bit. "
"i don't get it, hasn't Apple been closely working alongside law enforcement for years? Law enforcement has never demanded that Apple build a new version of iOS that removes a security feature before. you know, there was another thing that affected our privacy in the name of terrorism"
"you know it as the patriot act"
"or more recently, NDAA.  this shit has to stop, it's nothing more than an excuse to spy on innocent people.I'm going to say this yet again."
"The whole argument/debate/what have you is moot. Anyone with a week or two in any basic programming class or learning about programming can learn how to make a program to encrypt or obfuscate stuff."
"Do what you want, but it will quickly become an underground thing that everyone does. It will be completely unenforceable except as a tack on crime to other stuff.So can't they subpoena Apple for the contents of their email and apps?  Sounds like they are trying to get away with not also subpoenaing(sp?) Facebook and other sites for info and getting in with a devise that has the passwords stored.  If they break into the phone, do they have legal right to use the info they get from the sites they can now access?  Not sure if the in plain view of a search warrant suffices.  The CIA and FBI couldn't even predict the obvious - 9/11.  Even I knew something was going to happen because I read the news and was familiar with the Hart/Rudman report.   These people allegedly have far better resources to garner their information from.  Why would the American people trust them with the encryption key to their personal data?  They've already breached our trust a thousand times over.Yeh, all I heard is Apple is siding with the terrorists. My new daddy and protector of all the bad stuff in the world 'Donald Trump' said so. I don't understand all that computer hippie liberal talk and therefor your opinions are wrong.The fact that this requires elaboration baffles me. Those boomers can't die soon enough. this argument is simple, if the fbi wants the keys to phones regarding the case, they should ask for keys to the phones regarding the case but you cant ask for the keys to every and any phone you wantwhats weird/funny Apple had previously released a statement, almost pre-emptively, outlining exactly why they wouldn't do it, and more importantly, Couldn't. I really hope Apple's lawyers point out the fact that Judges, lawyers, and the general public are NOT experts in this field in any way, shape, or form, and therefore can't force a security threat to be built. Because it's not just one phone... It would never be just one phone. The quote in the subject line sends chills through me because it's so god damn true and I'm afraid it's not going to matter.Has there ever been an instance in which the federal government forced a company to develop a new product (in this case, an OS) in order to execute a warrant?"
"That's the part that really gets to me. I don't see how a court can order a company to make something brand new. That's like saying when a judge throws out a case against a murder because the police found the evidence without a warrant, that the judge is protecting the murderer.  No they're not, they're protecting everyone else.I do not even understand the problem, here.  They could force the company to do it, I suppose, through something like a (laughable) threat to revoke their corporate charter, but how can they force the individuals that actually work at the company to do *anything* at all?"
"Are they going to jail the CEO somehow for not *requiring* it of his employees?"
"Have the CEO say okay, then every programmer can say I don't know how, or even simply no."
"Can they jail every programmer at the company?  That is insanity.  They have committed no crime and cannot be conscripted into forced labor by the FBI.  A simple I don't know how is not disprovable.  How would any prosecutor be able to hold them responsible, in any way, for Not creating something?"
"I mean, they can demand that I paint them a Rembrandt, but that doesn't mean I will and it doesn't mean that I could.  It is impossible to prove that I could, and Not painting them a Rembrandt cannot, in any sane world, be considered a crime.Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."
"\- Ben Franklin"
"I am glad Tim Cook is fighting this! Security is of paramount importance. If you create a back door... You create a vulnerability! And we do everything online now, including online banking. While I understand the concerns, I think overall security trumps the FBI's request!Why can't Apple theoretically unlock the phone on their premises and pass the information on to the FBI? Surely rather than giving the FBI unrestricted access to a back door why can't they do it on a case by case basis when a court order is presented?"
"Wouldn't this please everyone? Criminals can't hide but the rest of us need not fear."
"Unless of course the FBI do just want to snoop on whomever they please whenever they please.This will go all the way to Supreme Court. Kinda miss Scalia now even ~~thought~~ though he though I was intellectually inferior to others. it's a joke.  they aren't protecting your data but they need you to think they are...They are avoiding conflict with their current and future customers.  If they opened this phone, these people would stop trusting Apple with their information and would stop buying their products.  Social Justice?  More like protecting projected profits.  No they are getting free advertising.  Acting like the world is ending.  First, even if some program got out, it would only effect iphones.  Second, the government already has the power to tap your phones and conduct nuclear war but this apple program would just be too dangerous to have eh?  What a fucking farce.How are they defenders of digital privacy? Have they not been giving other access to data since 2012 to the PRISM program?Yea but why is Apple protecting a shooter's iPhone data? /sNo apple is try to protect their bottom line because they fear a poser backlash nothing more.They could do it this time, and then not do it again. That's something they definitely can do. Doing it one time doesn't mean they have to always do it. If the give the fbi the program or a phone with it, then the fbi won't ever need to ask apple again, they could just load it on any phone."
"That's the problem.It was really only a matter of time before encryption technology ran up against federal demands for access. As much as I would like to think that my phone's information cannot be accessed by anybody else, I don't have that right and neither does anyone else. I live in a society, not a deserted island and this is one of those situations where the rights of the many outweigh the rights of the few. This is no different than a judge demanding that a lock inventor open a patented lock on a vault. >This is no different than a judge demanding that a lock inventor open a patented lock on a vault."
"You are correct. A bunch of people with no technical expertise are crying about something they don't understand. Besides, Apple has admitted they can get into any iPhone. Why aren't these folks outraged about that?I respectfully disagree. We may live in a society, but part of our social contract with it is the right to dissent. That's why we gave ourselves certain rights that are not to be impinged upon despite the greater good. There are limits to them, but we should not bargain them away for safety so obligingly."
"As the saying goes, then we will deserve neither.This is completely different.  This isn't about Apple accessing one guy's phone. They don't have that capability. They're being asked to write software in which will circumvent their own security, and which will be able to unlock any phone.  It's like if the lock inventor was asked to create a tool that will unlock any of their locks, and hand it to the FBI, with the promise that they'll only use it once. Bullshit.  Ever heard of the TSA master key?  That thing is already leakedI never said it was about one person's phone. Like it or not, this was inevitable once the government really needs (or wants) to get in there. The company created a level of encryption that put the security in the hands of the phone's owner. It was inevitable that sooner or later, a case would arise where a phone owner would not be around to open it for the Feds. So the Feds are shouting that it's too much level of security and demanding Apple find a way to open the lock it created. Personally, I'm fine with it. They need to get into Farooq's phone. Will this spread? Probably. Overall, it's not a good idea to have places where the people who govern a state are wholly blocked from access with or without legal cause to do so. That's why warrants exist. Will there be abuse? Most assuredly. How do we stop that? That's an entirely different conversation.Get off your emo trip.  This has never been inevitable.  This is about."
"As for your earlier comment about I don't have that right, you do. It's your right to privacy, and your right against self-incrimination. And your right against unreasonable searches. The FBI doesn't have the right to demand this software, which is why we even know about it in the first placeIf you want to have a constitutional law argument with me, bring it. But I first expect you to have at least a marginal understanding of Constitutional law before we start."
"You grossly contradicted yourself. You said: *It's your right to privacy*, as if this is some unfettered right you carry. It's not. There are segments of the Constitution that provide for some protections, but there is no carte blanche protection of your privacy. This is a matter of governance, not a fight with your mom over her jurisdictions in your bedroom. "
"Then you say *right against unreasonable searches*. This one is correct. But do you know what it means? It means the state must first build probable cause to make a request of a judge who can then provide a warrant to search you and your property. This was provided by the FBI to the judge who laid the order on Apple. "
"*Right against self-incrimination*? By whom? Farooq? He's dead. San Bernardino County because it's their cellphone? They haven't complained about the FBI wanting access. Did you mean Apple? Apple isn't being called to expose itself to charges of Farooq's crime. "
"Now, given these basic principles of some of the Constitution, please explain why you think the FBI doesn't have the right to this software?"
"EDIT: A word.How is compelling Apple to modify their device a search? The FBI has the suspects phone, they are free to search it however they want. They can take it apart and examine it any way they want. They could unsolder the flash memory and make a copy if they wanted to. They could ask Apple for a copy of their source code, but I would say the source code isn't evidence of a crime.That's what makes this case so golden. This is going to be the biggest crucible of the Fourth I've ever seen. So far, though, Apple hasn't filed a claim deriding the judge's order based off the Fourth Amendment. We do know that the judge's assistance order is based off a search warrant so the Feds are definitely premising their request to the judge based off a search of the phone."
"I said it earlier and still think it will prove to be true: Apple took to the court of public opinion quite possibly out of concern that it can't legally fight the judge on this. Are you from the US? Because in the US, we have the 4th Amendment in our Constitution. So our society has decided that in this case, the rights of the few outweigh the rights of the many. I hope that we as a society continue to fight for that to remain as it is today.I am indeed from the U.S., and please don't misinterpret the Fourth Amendment. It's an important right. It's not some magical force-field. It prohibits *unreasonable* searches and seizures and requires the state to provide a warrant under judicial sanction supported by Probable Cause. Which is why the FBI went to the judge. Whether you like it or not, the Feds are playing by the book. Frankly, I wonder whether Apple is balking publicly because it is worried that it has little legal ground to stand on. It's a fascinating case.> This is no different than a judge demanding that a lock inventor open a patented lock on a vault."
"It's actually closer to demanding the inventor create a custom version of the locking mechanism that's cut away so it's easier to bypass and then replace the more secure version in the target safe. There's a lot more active involvement required than simply opening a patented lock which is why physical metaphor doesn't work so great."
">I live in a society, not a deserted island and this is one of those situations where the rights of the many outweigh the rights of the few."
"Yes, the rights of the many (the public) **to privacy and secure communication** outweigh the rights of the few (the government) to easy evidence gathering."
"The government isn't as blind in this case as they want to seem, they have lots of information available. The lack of access to one iPhone's memory will not make or break this case and really isn't a huge deal in the grand scheme of things so I find it very concerning how far they want to push things just to get access.You guys are fucking idiots. Whenever someone comes on here and talk about how companies need to do the right thing, you come back with that hard capitalist line saying that companies exist to make profits and they have no obligation outside of that. "
"Do you really think apple givers a shit about your privacy? No, they care about their image, and staying in business. The US government is there best tucking friend and all these fucking mice dancing to the pied pipers tune. What is really better for apple, actual security and pissing off the US government, or false security and the government backing you? You don't get too big too fail by not playing ball. Go on little mice, hop hop along to the bullshit circus. Also, go buy the newest iphone it's totally secure and apple loves you, Steve Jobs was Jesus.But they also don't want to be in the nanny business. There are plenty of ways to crack an iPhone without Apple helping you. There are people that would do it for kicks.  Once Apple cracks one iPhone, then Apple is in the iPhone cracking business... They sell tens of millions of phones... They can't open a whole division to crack them one-at-a-time ... And they REFUSE to put in a backdoor so any random police officer can do it... Because that wouldn't stay secret 5 minutes.I was getting my nails done last night and they had the local evening news on the TV, and I heard them mention something about coming up: Apple is refusing to help the FBI... and I'm just sitting there thinking Oh, fuck me... which way are they going with this?"
"I was glad to see that the story didn't outright paint Apple as bad guys."
"The story in question: http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2016/02/17/apple-to-fight-order-to-help-fbi-uunlock-shooters-iphone/"
"as well as their bank balanceInstead of installing a backdoor for all iPhone ever sold, why can't they just unlock specific phones of terrorist/suspects?  This just seems like a publicity stunt to me....because that's the same thing? having a way to gain access on a case by case basis would require a BACKDOOR  made available on any device that they were trying -or may want to try- to access. Unless you mean *individually cracking encryption on a case by case basis* in which case, the only problem would be time, and the issue of the sliding scale that determines what constitutes a terrorist...You remember the Patriot Act?"
"Ya know, that thing that said terrorists and suspects don't have the same due process or rights as the rest of us?"
"And then every branch of government started stretching the definition of the word terrorist to mean Human being?"
"Yeah.....Um no they are doing both. The shooters could easily be part of a larger cell and that's why they went though the trouble of encrypting their data."
"Maybe there is information on that phone about people planning to blow the heads off of kids at a day care next."
"So everyone has to decide weather they are willing to live with the possible consequences. Would you be willing to sacrifice your own child life to protect someone's phone data privacy. Because that's what it could come down to in real terms.Has anyone considered this might be a PR stunt?  Apple is not doing too well right now, and they are depending on China to be their next big market to satisfy.  If China thinks American governments can access their iPhone data, they may not be willing to let apple sell shit loads of phones there.>Apple is not going too well right now"
"What?"
"http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2016/01/26Apple-Reports-Record-First-Quarter-Results.htmlYes, but their stock value doesn't reflect that.  If China blocked them from selling, it would fall further.Surely this would be an exception? Pretty radical of Apple if you ask me. Surely you're fucking joking...?Lol, surely not mate. Sounds a bit silly to me.You're entitled to feel any way you want. Just be sure you at least try and understand the implications of what that would mean. Not sure if you're a US resident or not, but our rights here are fading fast. "
"There's no magical mystery on that phone that's going to uncover an entire treasure trove of data that's going to stop any future attacks. The dude's fucking dead, as he should be. I can certainly appreciate where you're coming from, I am from the UK but resided in the US for about 8 years. I admit I have no clue what's going on and can see the fact that it puts the citizens security at risk, but why is everyone so scared t hide from the government when surely they probably have an idea about who you are and why would they care about the every day citizen. I can see it might affect the people a bit higher up in society I suppose?The reason is because this tool would inevitably be used more than once. It would be disseminated to trusted parties. And the thing about software is that it *always* eventually makes its way to the internet. Once this happened, iPhone security would be shot on a widespread scale, and it would no longer be safe to do things like buying from Amazon on your phone without worrying that your personal data might be stolen. Anyone who got ahold of your phone would have access to everything on it."
"It's not an issue of whether we should allow an investigation to see one phone, it's an issue of whether we should *permanently* defeat the security that keeps us safe. It is akin to unlocking every door and safe that exists for the sake of looking in one.Innocent people are dead too."
"Also I like how you make an assumption that your rights are fading then assume there isn't anything on the phone that would help them.That's the thing. If you take time to understand how encryption works a bit and read the entirety of Cook's open letter, you'll understand that there's no one-time exception to be made here. It's all or nothing. Once the solution the FBI is asking for exists, it exists forever.There is no such thing as an exception in encryption. If an algorithm is broken it is useless. Kind of like an FBI forensic expert getting caught lying just once.The point is that they can't just make the key to unlock this phone. Once they make the code to unlock one, they can unlock any iPhone out there.This the point that most are missing .True, but I'm not sure how. Those of us on Apple's side have led our arguments with this fact. Repeatedly.B-b-b-b-but TERRORISTS!I would be totally and completely on the government's side if there was a possibility of Apple making a code to unlock it that couldn't be used again, but that's impossible.If Apple were to make an exception here, then the government will expect them to make an exception next time as well. And they will expect the same from other companies. And other governments will expect the same from their corporations and people."
"It's not about this one single iPhone, it's about the entire technology industry and the future of privacy. We have a right to privacy, even from our own government, and once we give in even a little, it will snowball into something much more sinister."
"What's that old Ben Franklin quote? Those who would give up liberty, for a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety. Has never been more accurate.I wonder how they would respond to a terrorist attack on an Apple store.It is sad that someone actually has to connect these dots for people.  Anyone who cant see this doesnt understand the bigger pictureIf there was a clear terrorist threat to the Apple company or Tim Cook personally that phone would have been unlocked in minutes and we would have never heard about it.Yeah but thats also a totally different scenario.They're doing both, terrorists are giddy now. We will never defeat this enemy unless we use their tactics.This is one reason the Israeli Mossad have a real bad reputation... They sank to the levels of the people they fight. You become the monster you are fighting when you sink to their level. In a world of absolutes you are right, thankfully we don't live in that world.Defending THEIR OWN digital privacy.Yeah, in order to protect our privacy, we need to protect the privacy of  terrorists.  Even if all parties confirm that the phone could yield valuable information.  "

"https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-comment-fbi-effort-force-apple-unlock-iphoneNaw man, not knocking the EFF or ACLU at all. Just that one particular group....I thought it was strange when I drove by the Apple store downtown and saw a group of people having a rally to support Apple...that's a huge departure from people lining up to throw rocks at the tech buses....how'd that happen? Popped onto twitter and saw it was organized by said group. The investor class has started getting more politically active here in the Bay, and part of that has been hiring people that ran dirty tricks in election campaigns to work for them, and part of that has been taking a page from the Koch-book and funding these 'grassroots' initiatives that have hidden, pro-company-x agendas. That scares me, as they obfuscate their funding & true agendas, and then a buncha people get behind the efforts thinking they're doing something good, while actually acting against their own interests. The fact that happens, and is happening with increasingly frequency, and that a lots of people really can't seem to differentiate, says to me we need to be much more mindful about asking questions, investigating movements, and not blindly throwing our support behind something just because there's an article about it in some publication that purports to tell us what we want to hear. We have to be increasingly critical & skeptical in these changing times.I fucking hate Apple and even I think what you just said is laughable.  The only good thing coming out of that company is their stance on encryption.You, sir, are an idiot. This doesn't have anything to do with Apple vs. anybody. This has to do with your private information and the role of encryption. It wouldn't matter if it were Apple, Google, or anyone else -- but since it's Apple that has to lead this fight, and is at least fighting for what (most of us) believe in, you need to drop your petty anti-Apple jealous fuckery and open your eyes to how fucking important this is.FBI has hacked into at least 70 phones we know abou. This is a PR move and Apple doesn't give a shit about our privacy[deleted]Try reading your own source next time.What they actually did (according to what I've read) is bypass the lock screen, which doesn't actually allow access to any of the encrypted data.  It's just that in older versions of iOS most of the data wasn't encrypted by default, whereas newer versions encrypt everything."
"It even *says* this in the article you linked.No you dumb sheep, they are defending their own ass so that they can not be prosecuted for both running a monopoly and tax fraud. What they're really probably doing is avoiding the government having them do some complex modifications every time they want to hack into a phone.They are avoiding creating backdoors in the security of their product that compromise the security of the phone against malicious actors.They are avoiding creating backdoors in the security of their product that compromise the security of the phone against malicious actors. If you create a hole in security for the FBI, it is only time before another hacker finds and exploit."
"Apple is worried Samsung won't make enough chips for the iPhone because the Galaxy S6 is suddenly doing better than expectedWouldn't Apple have a contract with Samsung to make x number of chips by a certain date?You can guarantee they do. Just like the company that provides Apple with sapphire crystal who didn't meet the expectations.Not to mention how much money Samsung is making off of Apple, they have a very strong incentive to not lose that contract. With this type of deal you would usually have a flexible contract. large amounts of the components in these chips are in so many other phones of today too. it was a while back, but i read that the ARM risc processors were in 70% of smart phones. This was before intel jumped in the game. They are also produced the world over by a lot of companies, if the supply from samsung dried up, they could pick the chips up elsewhere at a comparable price. Either way this story is bullshit, it just wouldn't pay for samsung to stop supplying them chips, they could restrict them or drive the price up due to demand, but stop? That would just be dumb.ARM produces general architectures for cores as well as other components that make up a chip. However, the actual implementation of the core, as well as any changes or additions at the system level, such as different I/O systems or things like that, are decided by the company designing the chip (eg. Qualcomm, Samsung, Broadcomm, etc.). Apple designs their own custom chips using ARM cores, so they can't get them unless the specifically hire someone to manufacture them."
"There are 4 companies that can manufacture at 14nm/16nm: Samsung, GlobalFoundries, TSMC, and Intel. Intel doesn't really offer general manufacturing to outside companies. Apple has contracts with all 3 of the others it seems, but GloFo has yield issues and TSMCs process is a bit different from Samsung's. So apple has options, but not really many.Don't worry, I wrote a few papers on ARM a while back so i know how they operate. I didn't realise the production had dropped to so few though. Was this after the flooding in Indonesia by any chance? People were leasing production rights all over only just 4 years ago. Also, i thought that intel had created their own chip and only used small parts from other companies.   Hmm perhaps there's some confusion. Not sure where it is though let me try to clarify."
"First of all, I should state that the manufacturers I mentioned are the ones who can make processors/SoCs at that scale. There may be DRAM or flash manufacturers as well, I'm less familiar with them. I think maybe micron and SK hynix have 14nm for memory? Not sure though."
"The four I mentioned are the only ones to date that have developed 14nm logic manufacturing. That means they're collectively doing the manufacture for AMD, Qualcomm, Nvidia, and anyone else trying to produce 14nm parts with a fabless model. I think you knew that but I just thought I would clarify in case that hasn't been made clear, so hopefully this doesn't sound like I'm trying to condescend."
"The issue is that finfets are a substantial r&d leap, so lots of companies are giving up in scaling, since they can't keep up with the main 4. That's lead to the current situation.Nono, no confusion. I said my info was from four years ago and I think that was the A7 chip and surrounding systems back then. it just seemed that 4 years ago more companies were producing the chips is all.Yeah, lots of people gave up around 32nm or 28nm I think. Beyond that is when traditional planar technologies started breaking down.If Apple wanted some good PR, they can take their cash surplus and open their own fab in the united states to produce their SOC's.It's just too expensive :(. Even with the reduced cost in operations and logistics and the reduced risk of production halts due to environmental change or governmental change, it's still too expensive. Don't forget you have to set up the factory and then train the skilled labour required to build the chips. Yes, but they have like 700 billion in cash reserves. I'm sure they could take 5 billion of that and invest in another USA fab to create a joint venture for a dedicated Apple Soc fab. that would look shit on their portfolio and leave their investors saying, why the fuck is that 5bn not coming back to me in dividends? Don't forget that Apple inc has let it's even slightly socialist attitude die with Steve Jobs. If you can justify the expenditure with a well thought out plan then you're gucci, if not, you are at the mercy of your board mate.But it would be a long term investment in Apples future. would it? Tell me the reasons it would be a long term investment to build a factory solely dedicated to the purpose of producing chips that could be made irrelevant in the near future in a country where the current political movement is to cut into your margins by increasing minimum wage? You can't even guarantee that your workers will buy your product dude. It's not even close to an investment.Uh, Apple is building a computer assemble plant already. Also investing in an SOC fab would enable them to ditch intel cpu's in favor of their own cpu in the coming years. Also fabs are not dependednt on menial labor, they are very dependent on highly skilled labor. So minimum wage is not an issue when it comes to fabs. They'd also get sued into the ground (hard) if Samsung broke their contract.Probably not. They'd probably just have some sort of penalty clause already in place.Yep. Liquidated damages. Exactly.  They would lose more profit by breaking the iPhone contract than they would by selling more of their phones.  It's a very tricky situation though. With Samsung being the only player making 14nm chips they are now in the position of collecting a lot of new customers and ramping up production for those new customers. Now the big wigs who write the contracts don't always take fab capacity into account...that is to say they somewhat plan for a future capacity. Problem is sometimes this future capacity just can't be reached (not in time anyway)."
"In the end though apple will get their chips just perhaps not right on time.and my point is not on time is not acceptable, and the very reason for contracts.  Apple isn't buying chips from Samsung and expecting samsung to sell them to them if and when Samsung feels like it, and lets Samsung decide, without warning, that they are no longer going to provide chips.  If Samsung diverts capacity from Apple for their own chips, or anyone else's, or just to make nothing at all, there is either a fee written into the contract, or Apple would begin the lawsuit that day for breach of contract and lost earnings.  Companies like that don't just trust other suppliers to provide vital components whenever they feel like it.Exactly! Not meeting contractually obligated supply deadlines would be way worse for Samsung since there could be heavy financial penalties. That could put further burden on their manufacturing facilities which would set back the supply of chips for their own phones. I totally agree with you. My original comment should have been worded better. It's likely more of a flexible date and is renegotiated a few times during initial product ramp. Obviously though if Samsung wants the big money and to keep future contracts they will try their hardest to crunch out every available wafer to meet the initial contract. But here's he other side of business (that i deal with daily, though on a smaller level)"
"Samsung is the only one making these. Apple can wait, or apple can sue, and then have even bigger delays in receiving the chips they need, further slowing their production."
"Samsung can't fuck with them too much, but at the same time, Apple needs Samsung and has to play ball a littleDepends entirely on the margins of each. I imagine they make more on each chip when they go into their own phones than when they sell one to Apple. Then again, Apple is known to have huge margins, maybe they passed some along to Sammy. Doubtful. Jesus you are so stupidWow, so articulate. You most be a genius to be able to form such a riveting thought.You most be a genius yourself.  Next time you insult someone's intelligence you might consider reviewing your statement before you post it.How is calling you a genius insulting your intelligence? And what would you have changed in the post, Mr. Editor?You most be joking.How so?Most you downvote me?That's *where* their huge margins come from.  They pay the lowest possible price for components and they charge a premium price for the finished goods. "
"I doubt they are inspired to share more money than they have to with Samsung.   But I've been wrong before... That was my point. I simply meant could they be paying Samsung so little that Samsung would be better off fulfilling their own needs first, even with any penalty goes along with not meeting Apple's needs. I think I replied to the wrong person, my bad. it has little to do with margins.  It has a lot more to do with Apple's contract likely having huge fines for late shipment of parts, especially if it is intentional, which Samsung choosing to supply their own phones first would be.  "
"I don't know the exact practice for phones, but with that many components coming together, they have to have financial protections in place to ensure suppliers provide parts on time.  There is no way Samsung wouldn't be hit with huge fines for not supplying what they contracted with Apple.  Now it is possible that beyond a certain point, Samsung would have fulfilled their quota and could not supply everything Apple wanted right away, but that would only come after Apple has outsold their projected numbers.I seriously doubt any contract with Samsung for parts doesn't include a clause that allows Samsung to supply their own phones first.  Why do you think Apple is worried here?  If what you said was true they would have nothing to worry about.If there is a contract then typically the penalty for failing to meet demand is way worse."
"But you would really think iPhone production sales has slowed down since they are halfway through their cycle.Pretty sure the article referenced the supposed next-gen A9 instead of the currently used A8. Ah, well you would want to believe they prepared for that before they signed a contract.Can you really imagine that Apple didn't think of that? lol> But you would really think iPhone production sales has slowed down since they are halfway through their cycle."
"So they're ramping up production for the next one. Shouldn't the next iPhone be a minor refresh though? I guess I can't think of anything the 6 did that was that much better than the 5S anyway. Maybe it will be a decent update.Flexibility, it did flexibility better.Ayyy, this guy.In procurement, it depends.  I don't know much about these chips, but -"
"If you have multiple suppliers and overall ample supply in a network, you generally can use supply agreements.  This is because as a buyer, I want the most competitive cost, and I'm not worried about finding supply in general. "
"Second tier would be basically supply contracts where you negotiate price yearly, but both parties can walk away if they can't agree on price, and the buyer doesn't necessarily need to commit to a specific volume.  And, the supplier is within their rights to supply what only what they can.  For example, there was a strike on Alumina recently with only 3 vendors domestically.  The other 2 vendors got an increase in demand beyond their capacity to produce - so they capped certain customers, at their digression.  Well within their rights."
"If you have a single supplier, or a hard to procure product, thats when you get into formal contract with very specific wordage... "
"but realistically, even those are easy as hell to break."
"#procurementlifeSssh, you're making too much sense which is taking valuable clicks away from BusinessInsider. Why you gotta break the circlejerk?Yeah what's he doing thinking stuff. It's obvious that the Samsung division in charge of chips is gonna be like fuck apple we have too many gs6s too worry about themTrue but the contract is probably y units until 201X. Problems arise when they try to renew it and samsung prioritizes their S6 production and says best we can do is way less than you need.Stop making sense you wiseguy, these guys are trying to have an anti-circlejerk circlejerk here!Yes I imagine so.[deleted]My first thought as well, probably a bad idea to have your main competitor make your shit when they need it for their productIt's kind of hard when only a handful of companies in the world make certain necessary components. Samsung's components industry is vastly different from their smartphone one. In fact they've even had lawsuits against each other or other parts of the Samsung conglomerate. Even HTC sources some parts from Samsung.Especially when you're constantly suing that competitor > it's not the best idea to source major components of your product from your biggest competitor."
"It's an even worse idea to try to sue them. Why would Samsung stop selling stuff?"
"If apple stops buying from Samsung they will buy from someone else or make it in house. So what's the point of that?Hopefully Tim Cook reads /r/technology then maybe they'll be successful. > Unless Samsung has general production problems this is unlikely to be an issue, but as a general rule it's not the best idea to source major components of your product from your biggest competitor."
"Just a quick question; you know how the split the product line with some using their own design whilst others using the Qualcomm one, were Samsung building the Qualcomm ones or were they sourcing it from an external supplier? the reason why I ask is it sounds pretty reasonable that there might be supply constraints of the Qualcomm were sourced externally but since they've moved completely to their own CPU design then it might put pressure on their fabrication capacity leaving very little room left over for third parties in their plants.They source it from the place with the best price and have contracts as such. If Samsung can't keep up to pace then they'll get it from the next best place."
"You're mistaken if you believe Samsung's chip manufacturing division prioritises the success of Samsung's phone sales division over its own sales."
"That's just not how large multi-national corporations work."
"Each is a separate business and will act independently to maximise its own profits. Losing Apple as a long term customer just to prioritise a few more Galaxy's being sold is not in the best interest of the business.That isn't how it works mate You say this as if they have other alternatives that are just as reliable they didn't consider for some reason.damn I wonder why tim cook never consulted you firstActually most of the chips come from TSMC, so I don't see the issue here.They keep two suppliers in case one struggled. >as a general rule it's not the best idea to source major components of your product from your biggest competitor."
"The exception is when you make just as much if not more money supplying the competition. This must be the case otherwise Samsung would've stopped a long time ago. The iPhone sells a ton of units, Samsung is riding the back carriage of Apple's money making train no doubt. "
"I guess the deal to supply chips to Apple kind of acts like a hedge to Samsung's risk exposure in the smart phone market. "
"To be fair, very few companies can do bigger volume and better quality than Samsung. Apple having Samsung make their parts was a good business decisionYeah no shit - why not let Intel make them?I'm not sure why you're being downvoted. That's why they don't use only one supplier: http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/04/15/apple-makes-last-minute-decision-to-use-tsmc-for-30-of-a9-chip-orders-for-next-iphoneSo what you're saying is, they're in cahoots?Or just source from GlobalFoundries. They use the same flow as Samsung.They should also have really good contracts so would be $$$ back if they can't deliver on time.>Unless Samsung has general production problems this is unlikely to be an issue, but as a general rule it's not the best idea to source major components of your product from your biggest competitor."
"At the end of the day Samsung is in the business of selling things. It doesn't really matter if they sell them to Apple or some other retailer/carrier who sells them to you.  In either case they still sell their things, and in *this* case, they're selling both ways.This is like diversifying your portfolio, but for company sales.  It's really the best move for them, haha.  Whether iPhones sell better, or Galaxies sell better, they win out.Samsung phone division buys chips from their semiconductor division.  They also buy equipments from their manufacturing division to build phones.   "
"They probably get them for a lot cheaper.Apple doesn't make chips so they don't compete with Samsung Semiconductor.Should probably call up Apple, that might be something their company hasn't thought of. "
"/sWhat if they're not actually competing, they're just doing the thing where companies create a fake kind of competition to spur consumerism when in fact they're colluding to keep the money between each other ***?*** "
"[edit] I'm not suggesting some hail corporate conspiracy, this is a well known phenomenon that one could learn about in an intro psych or Econ course"
"[edit] This was a question for discussion, I wasn't making any sort of claim you dolts! Perhaps I should've included a question mark at the end You are describing a [cartel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartel).A kartel/cartel?This does happen which is why there are laws against it. This would violate national and international antitrust laws, they would be sued for millions if not billions of dollars if they were caught. How do I know? I am an engineer and I recently had training at work regarding this issue, and then found out our company had to pay nearly 50 Million because of antitrust laws that were broken about a decade ago. It is really bad for them if they did that. And it is really really illegal. Wouldn't surprise me since Samsung did it with DRAM chips and LCD displays.Isn't this what Coke and Pepsi do?Corporations are so big these days that one department could be competing while the other department down the hall way is working together.Seeing that italicized question mark before reading your edit had me confused.That thing is called OligopolyI tip my fedora to you."
"But really, no. It is always a good idea to sell products to even to your competitors.Because that is almost certainly less profitable for both companies than if either of them didn't stick to the deal to collude.Especially with no other real competitor if they could divide the market in half both stand to make a lot of money.Ah, the old Time Warner/Comcast power divvy.Oligopoly?Beatles/Stones. It's like Canadian Bacon: Economics. Yeah uh, no. Apple and Samsung are not in cahoots to create 'fake competition'. This guy said they are not. That means they are not. 100% not in cahoots. Cause this guy said.Well they're certainly both making a fuck tonne of money from their competition. You'd be foolish to think they hope their opponent fails. The fact that you had to edit and clarify that is an actual thing that is taught in econ and behaviour learned about in psych is just astonishing."
"They are multi-billion dollar companies...The loser is only making a few billion less. Stop picking a side and pick your side, the consumer side so that they don't continue to fuck us over with incremental bullshit upgrades every year.You don't have to buy those upgrades every year, I'm still using a second hand S3 that I bought broken and fixed.It's definitely a cournot or Nash equilibrium but I'm too high to remember which one "
"Edir: Haha actually that's just the equation shit They're not colluding, they're just trying to operate a mutually beneficial arrangement for this particular part of the iPhone."
"Samsung is happy to give Apple a good deal on the parts Apple is asking of it because Samsung doesn't want Apple giving billions of dollars in business to a competitor. It also helps Samsung to remain dominant in its neck of the supply chain woods, not to mention helps Samsung get higher volume discounts and increase leverage for the parts it needs to source."
"Apple meanwhile, is happy to take advantage of the fact that Samsung is willing to give them a good deal on those parts for the reasons above."
"Samsung is in the weaker overall position here. It doesn't do anything unique or do it so well that one of its competitors couldn't do it if given the opportunity.Samsung does have a bit of a fab advantage of TSMC right now. From what I remember there isn't a fab on the planet other than samsung that can produce the chips apple is looking for.  "
"Edit: There isn't another fab on the planet that can produce the A9 at 14nm.  TSMC and GF can both do it at 20nmDing ding ding ding ding. You got it. It's funny to think that it's actually in Samsungs best interest for the iPhone to be successful because of how much they sell to Apple.They make less money off selling chips to apple than if they'd sell them in their own phones.

"The same applies to apples custom chip. For Samsung Apple might be a better customer than Samsung mobile.>Samsung is not just one company."
"Samsung is a company, though. All subsidiaries are still part of Samsung.Samsung isn't one company.Really?"
">Samsung (Hangul: samseong; hanja: San Xing ; Korean pronunciation: [skamsk^NG]) is a South Korean multinational conglomerate company headquartered in Samsung Town, Seoul.Look into it more deeply. Samsung is actually several different corporations one of which is Samsung Electronics. Samsung electronics is still a subsidiary of the company Samsung.What are the odds that EVERY person that has bought an iPhone would buy a Samsung phone if there were no iPhones? ONLY in that case there would be no difference, so it's better to have Apple around.That would only be the case if they made just as much money off of selling a chip to apple as they make off selling a phone, which is a ludicrous notion.Well, someone mentioned this in the thread:"
"> Samsung Electronics has to sell the chips to Samsung Mobile the same way anyone else does. "
"So as far as Samsung Electronics is concerned, they would earn less as I've said before. Samsung Mobile, of course, could benefit ... but you never know. :)That's not the right way to look at it.  There is such a thing as value in wider distribution.  Even if Samsung makes more money per chip by selling them in their own device, making less money per chip while selling a massive number of additional chips in iPhones is still more profit than they would make otherwise.  "
"This is exactly how Trader Joes, Walmart, and Amazon's business model's work.  Companies sell their products cheaper to them knowing they will move a lot of units.  Thinner margins but higher profits.Yes and no. "
"If Apple spends marketing and overhead on capturing a segment that wasn't in the cards for them, then they can either have a small percentage of something or a large percentage of nothing. Their production levels are not restricted to their own products."
"The more chips they manufacture, the cheaper per-unit cost."
"They're not proprietary, so why wouldn't you sell to all takers?still a lot of fucking money thoThis is narrow thinking. The market saturation is higher for Apple + Samsung phones than straight Samsung.is that so? I imagine the productions costs for these chips aren't too big and they are pretty much guaranteed to always know how many they need. So there's little cost, guaranteed to sell, guaranteed to not overproduce and if they actually have set up a business contract then they are also guaranteed to have that income for a few years. I think betting on the phones could make them more money but there's way more risks involved.Are you being serious? Apple doesn't know how many phones they'll sell any more than Samsung does. And no, they cannot conceivably make as much money on selling chips to a cell phone manufacturer than by manufacturing cell phones directly. You're assuming they'd be able to turn every chip they make into a cell phone sale. Apple orders their chips based off how many phones they plan to produce, not how many they think they'll sell. That's an important distinction.As does Samsung... Why do you think Samsung has magical premonition?Right, but if Samsung produces chips for their own phones and they don't sell, that's Samsung's problem. If Samsung produces chips for Apple and Apple doesn't sell their phones, that's not Samsung's problems.I'm not sure how they do things when it comes to chip-fabbing, but Apple have been known to buy up their suppliers' production capacity and not focus on unit price. More or less to insure themselves against situations like this.It's ok, he's taken Reddit business classes. Reddit Business School must be rolling in sweet, sweet cash considering the number of redditors who seem to have their MBA.All online?Production cost?  Not really?"
"Production space?  Most certainly."
"And that is not cheap."
"Sammy ain't spending an extra billion bucks for fab facilities so apple can make bank.  Their own chips take priority.Production cost is still huge. Individually maybe not so much, but retooling their massive factories every time there's a tech upgrade costs tens to hundreds of millions.> is that so? I imagine the productions costs for these chips aren't too big  "
"Any chance you have $3-4 billion lying around to set up a plant for NAND flash memory or OLED lines? How about an additional several hundred million to set up R&D centers and hire scientists?  "
"[deleted]And if they went about that tomorrow without having a sufficient justification and promising ROI, some heads would roll. Apple shareholders are among the most demanding and vicious. Apple already got kicked and prodded around once into shelling out dividends.  and why haven't they? Apple does - maybe long term mfg is a possibility "
"Or maybe Intel will eat everyone's lunch again. Oh, if only money was something we could just throw around without consequences and restrictions. Marginal costs are not that high in *most* sectors of technology.  That's actually a huge part of why the price of technology goes down over time.But wouldn't they have that already? for a start up it'd be impossible but I imagine they already had to build these chips or chips like them any way? I could be completely wrong of course.You have to rebuild the machines every few years as well to keep up with new lithography processes. A billion dollars every year or two just to keep up with one factory.Also, when they get new lithography machines, which is fairly often because each step down in feature size often requires reengineering parts of the tool these days, the price jumps up even more. The astronomical cost of scanners, spinners, and metro these days is mind boggling... Im not saying isn't worth it. The engineering in NXT1970s is borderline magic.Yeah but that initial cost is still factored into the manufacturing cost of the chip. Depends. Will you take a two party, out of state, bad check?Source?Wrong."
"They spend **stupid** amounts of money marketing their phones, it's unbelievable how much they blow on that."
"Money spent marketing chips to Apple? Nearly zero."
"Every chip they sell to Apple turns a profit. Every phone they sell has a margin based on a crazy number of factors, many of which are beyond their control.Every chip sold does not necessarily turn a profit. Selling at a loss initially is very common in the semiconductor industry. You're often banking on process/yield improvements improving the production costs as the production run goes on.

The flash memory industry in particular is often running razor thin margins.They're in the industry for a reason.Better sell an iPhone than any other non-Samsung though.Sure, but Samsung is already dominating the market, so someone who doesn't get an iphone is far more likely to get a Samsung rather than any other phone.>Sure, but Samsung is already dominating the market,"
"Nokia used to be #1, now they're almost dead. HTC used to dominate, now they're slipping fast. Apple used to be #1, but android ate the their lunch. Samsung won't be #1 forever, especially given how shabby their UI and OS is. (I really loathe my Note 3)"
"> so someone who doesn't get an iphone is far more likely to get a Samsung rather than any other phone."
"Not me. I don't like iOS, but I know I'll never buy another Samsung. I may go back to HTC."
"Apple was never even close to #1. They're actually currently at one of their highest percentages of cell phone market share.  "
"Profit share wise Apple got to number one, and they'll be there for the foreseeable future.Android didn't 'eat Apple's lunch' -- Apple is still way, way ahead in terms of profit generated. It's not a game of sheer units; comparing Android units shipped vs. iOS is worthless because there's toaster being sold with Android on them. If you're the business or a shareholder you care about profits, the rest of us don't give a fuck and focus more on what phone is more popular rather than which one is more profitable. I'd actually prefer the less profitable ones, on average, since those are less of a ripoff. "
"The Note 4 matches the iPhone 6+ but costs 16% less for the same storage amount (128gb 6+ is $949 vs $800 for Note 4 plus a 128gb mSD, which actually gives you 160gb total storage). The iPhone is still $50 more even if you go for the very cheapest option with half of the Note 4's internal storage and no expansion capacity. There aren't any clear cut spec wins for the iPhone here aside from low-light camera and OS preference. The iPhone actually felt slower, but probably due to hilariously too slow transition animations in a prior version of iOS.>Android didn't 'eat Apple's lunch' -- Apple is still way, way ahead in terms of profit generated."

I think my household all independently of each other now have each kind of xperia device...New York used to be the best place to go, now it is Australia. Then Australia sucked so now it is Mars. What next? Is love the best place to go?Android ate their lunch??? "
"Yes, Android dominates the market by quantity but Apple is making way more money from their phones than all android providers combined.Fair enough. I was indeed referring to sold units, not the profit generated from selling units.I love the hardware on my S5, but the software is shit and the lockdowns are fucking annoying.Agreed. The hardware is fairly decent. The GPS on the Note 3 could be better. WHen I switch, I'm going to miss that screen!In terms of volume we're probably likely to see Chinese smartphone companies come up on top. I wonder if they will be able to break into the western markets as well.[no source provided]Samsung Electronics has to sell the chips to Samsung Mobile the same way anyone else does. Sometimes they're the lowest bidder, sometimes they aren't, which is why the S5 Active uses a Qualcomm chip. That's because up until now Qualcomm chips had better modems than the exynos equivalents. That's why Samsung used Qualcomm for their US models.>Samsung Electronics has to sell the chips to Samsung Mobile the same way anyone else does. Sometimes they're the lowest bidder, sometimes they aren't, "
"Pretty sure that you have to buy the products for the self-costs (and maybe an appropriate margin  added) when selling within  companies of  the same corporation  otherwise you could simply overcharge and evade taxes or manipulate operational results too easily.You'd be surprised at how much companies actually cannibalize each other so their books look better. It's called Transfer Pricing. One subsidiary can sell a product to the parent and vice a versa for a profit as they in reality are two different companies with two different budgets and goals. However when it comes to reporting for tax purposes (dependant on where you are from) the reports would be 'consolidated' to represent figures as if they are just a single entity. This is called Hollywood accounting.This (your comment, I mean) is wrong.Not really. "
"One business's 100 dollar expense to their subsidiary turns into a 100 dollar gain at said subsidiary. At the end of the year, for tax purposes, it appears like there was no sale, since the net gain/loss is zero. "
"That's called compartmentalization, with fair tax laws. [deleted]Why would they overcharge and why would the other company pay the inflated price? They both have a duty to their owners/shareholders. I may be confused in what you're saying though. Depends on your country though. >which is why the S5 Active uses a Qualcomm chip."
"No, the S5 active uses a Qualcomm chip because Samsung's Exynos chip doesn't receive on the necessary LTE bands for 4G in the US.This is the correct answer. Not just the S5 active, the S3, S4, S5, Note 4 all had snapdragon processors in the US variants due to Qualcomm's LTE radio built into the chip. The international versions of those phones used Samsung's exynos processor."
"Of course, this changed with the S6 as now Exynos has the required radio built-in and Samsung has no problems selling the Exynos variant worldwide.This is a load of nonsense."
"There has been LTE versions with Exynos since the S2. The S4 and Note 4 Snapdragons didn't have modems."
"The S6 does *not* have an integrated modem neither. Except verizon and sprint models still have a qualcomm radio chip on top of the exynos processor. Phone is labeled to show it and user guide confirms it.It's called hedging your bet.  If Samsung sells a shit ton of phones, then awesome.  However, if they don't, they still profit a bit from Apple.>They make less money off selling chips to apple than if they'd sell them in their own phones. So that's dumb."
"Citation? They sell *more* chips by selling to Apple, because if they didnt, Apple would simply get their chips elsewhere, and the only sales in this sector they'd have left is Android. Better to have sales in *both* markets than exclude yourself from your competitors market.Similarly, Microsoft makes billions from Android through patents. You are being downvoted, but it's true: Microsoft's most profitable mobile OS is... Android. [Source](http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsofts-most-profitable-mobile-operating-system-android/)Thanks for enlightening info.Marx realized that distortions of the free market like collusion and monopoly were actually the natural end result of capitalism. He was right.I'd believe you if they weren't constantly suing each other for hundreds of millions of dollars. Court isn't cheap and those stakes are a bit too high for their love/hate relationship to be a game. Besides, it would be a grave mistake for Samsung not to keep up supply to Apple, for it would all of a sudden create something dreadfully enticing about Apple's product... Scarcity. The drama and how it gives their fanboys something to cheer on might just be worth the money thougSamsung has already been busted for price fixing across multiple industries. Wouldn't put it past them to be manipulating things in the microprocessor market too.Well it's money you can keep out of marketing - because it's doing the same job. Think of it this way, if the news every other day is APPLE VS SAMSUNG, then Nokia is going to get zero love. Drama fuels news these days.suing each other Think about it. You sue me I sue you. Settle in court boom.But if they're both under the same parent company, for example, who loses what to whom?It's one to sue for hundreds of millions, but getting both sides to settle for it is another thing.not to mention that is about as much as both of them would have to pay if they were caught doing what the other comment suggested. It would be highly illegal to collude like that. You're funny to really think that hundreds of millions of dollars isn't actually cheap to them. They make double that off a single flagship device. Even if really was a charade, they have the money to do it for lulz because they know it creates competition and elitism among their consumers, which makes them even more money."
"When companies are going to each other for production / manufacturing, they're in league with each other to make money, no other reason. That's business. Both companies have way more than enough money to do court games. So you're saying... they're good actors and they sacrifice money just for the sake of their art?It's cyclic. It's not a maintained phenomenon.Court isn't cheap, but I bet they make their money back in all the free press they get. It's not cheap to buy your way into the news every day. It is cheap to swap a few hundred million between each other and get the press for free.Those suits never go anywhere.  The most that ever happens is they have to quit selling a device they already quit selling 3 years ago."
"They're scaring the competition and encouraging the public to say Oh my God - patents are evil!  We'd better reform patents so megacorps can make whatever the hell they want without paying licensing fees!What's a few hundred million among billionaire bros? It's like boxing but for rich people. Possibly 10% or more of their net worth?Unless I'm calculating wrong, it's just 0.01356% of Apple and ~~0.00004237% of Samsung. I had no idea Samsung was that huge until I looked that up, Jesus.~~ Do not believe anything I say.That doesn't seem right.  Apple's market cap is 700 billion and Samsung is 200 billion.  So the 2 billion lawsuit is 0.3% of Apple and 1.0% of Samsung.That's 200 Trillion for Samsung. They make EVERYTHING.Apple is 90% BS and bubble. Technology and capital/equipment, probably doesn't worth few billion.Are you an idiot?no. but I bet you are the idiot who owns AAPL and think it will keep climbing.Samsung, is like, huge, dude. market cap is only price x # of shares. Samsung has twice the worth of assets and equity.~~It's actually a T after Samsungs market cap ;) Took me by surprise too!~~ False misinformationNo it's 200 billion, not trillion. Where did you read the 200 trillion?Wait, 200 trillion? That doesn't seem right. It is, and it isn't. It's right ... in won. It's a bit under $200 billion in USD.Samsung Electronics has a market cap of c. $170 bn but the Samsung Group is much larger. But it is also at least partially privately held, so it is difficult to value.Samsung is a confusing corporation to keep track off because the 200 billion belongs to Samsung Electronics. They also have Samsung Engineering, Samsung C and T, Samsung Life Insurance, Samsung Everland, Cheil Worldwide, and those are only the ones still under the name Samsung: Samsung is technically also The Shinsegae Group, CJ Group and Hansol Group. They are fucking massive and hold way more than they are willing to admit, to the point of being 17% of a nations total GDP. To Korea, they are literally too big to fail. Because people think of Samsung Electronics when the word Samsung comes out, when I believe Samsung Electronics while still the blue chip subsidiary, is 1 of 60-70 companies comprising the SAMSUNG GROUP. Samsung does MUCH more than just phones. Their screens are at the bleeding edge of technology in all departments, processors, TVs, lots of household machines...They also build sentry guns if that means anythingMaybe this is the most important thing...Not to mention Samsung Heavy Industries which built some of the tallest and largest structures ever."
"Though technically they're a different company. Wtf that is a thing?Samsung is one of world's top 3 shipbuilders.  They also built part of the Burj Khalifa.  They also run an investment bank.  And they sell artillery.  And life insurance.  And even jet aircraft now.  They are much bigger than just electronics although electronics is their largest division.  But a single old man is behind the whole Samsung family. He's in the works of combining and shifting all Samsung companies to minimize inheritance tax when he dies.When South Korea rebuilt, they had the entire country behind the companies. A few companies own everything in Korea. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChaebolThe baseball teams in Korea are named after companies instead of cities like in the US......Samsung Lions.Well, the corporations tend to own the stadiums over here instead. Ignoring stuff like Nascar etc. of course.Nah.  Apple even conspired with Microsoft and Google to keep engineer salaries down at one point.   They're corporations, they keep their daggers in their left hands even as they shake on their deals and both companies know it.    You couldn't differentiate between their collusion and their backstabbing.  Even THEY probably can't.You see very clearly my friend, might want to watch your back with those eyes.It's like Game of Thrones but with nerds.> It's like Game of Thrones but with nerds."
"So... Game of Thrones.Game of PhonesThis will be a t shirt somewhere in 3 days you heard it here first Don't know about a t-shirt but this picture has been around for years http://images.mynexuswallpaper.com/Gallery/1_Android%20Backgrounds/My-Nexus4-game-of-phones-6a7.jpgAll hail the king of the northbridge!King of the Androids and the flash mem,"
"Protector of Qualcomm.Jon Overflow and the House Stack?Winter is bufferingYeah, lots of groups from one company dealing with lots of groups from the other. Some get along, some don't.This makes me think of the time Sony sued itself. "
"These companies are so big they don't know who's who sometimes. except a lot of what people are describing is incredibly illegal. They would likely have to pay tens of millions of dollars if they were caught colluding like that. Collision doesn't have to be spoken. Both companies can essentially collude by matching each others pricingI saw it happen at AT&T first hand.  The upgrade fee for getting a new phone used to be much lower ($18 I think), and it used to be waived quite often.  We got an email from corporate saying Verizon charges $26, so we're going to start doing that too."
"Of course this was years ago.  That upgrade fee is up to $40 now.  I'll likely switch providers when it's time for my next phone."
"Only tens of millions?Tens of millions is nothing compared to their billion dollar law suitsTens of millions < what they actually make from the shenanigans That hasn't stopped it from happening a hundred times over in the past. Do you really think that everything that goes on inside these massive multi-national companies is lawful?"
"Huge companies with a too big to fail mindset break the law on a daily basis, and most of the time nothing is done about it. They all have their secrets. Even if they do get caught and charged the court cases will take years if not decades to play out. of course not which is why companies are caught breaking those laws all the time. Even then, what they end up being fined or sued for could be less than they illegally gained from doing so.Haha, not in a million of years. Samsung is really a bunch of separate companies. They sell shit to themselves at market value, since when you're selling Chips to people like apple, they won't keep buying it of you're supply the competition for next to nothing. So yes, Samsung would save money on their own phones, but they'd likely lose a lot of supply deals for chips and displays etc. Not worth it. > Samsung is really a bunch of separate companies."
"Not really. Its merely their structure. Samsung, like MANY SE ASIAN countries runs their corporations almost like state corps."
"They are often family, however they treat them like private state corporations - its complicated."
"But SAMSUNG is more a single company than the design and marketing teams at Apple. Sorry to burst that well voted bubble."
"Samsung - is FUCKING MASSIVE.Actually, they run them like I said they run them, as separate, independent companies. There is no need to clarify it. It is obvious they are all under the samsung umbrella, but just because the mobile  device says samsung on it, doesn't mean they can get the SOC at manufacturing cost. They pay the same rates as anyone else. >Samsung is really a bunch of separate companies"
"That's not the half of it. Samsung is a multinational conglomerate made of hundreds of separate giant corporation in fields like construction, finance, insurance, chemical supply, hotels, medicine, and yes, electronics."
"The South Korean headquarters had 2010 revenues of 280 TRILLION dollars(EDIT: It is actually Won, so 260 billion dollars). Nevermind the rest of the world.Where did you get that number? Sound unlikely. Maybe it's Won.Doh, you are right. It was South Korean Won."
"So about 260 billion US dollars."
"Which for comparison, South Koreas entire GDP is only 1000 billion.I don't know how you can not worth it and summarize a bazillion dollar company (that practically runs South Korea's economy) when they probably have some of the most talented business people and accountants analyzing this very thing every day.Because the money they make as a whole by manufacturing products for other corporations, is more money than they'd make via profits on an s6 without paying for the chips. But they're all under the Samsung umbrella... so it doesn't really matter *what* the price is, since it's just moving cash from one internal accounting ledger to another.It doesn't matter to Samsung as a whole, it certainly matters to each section. Yup. Samsung is what is known as a Chaebol in Korea or Keiretsu in Japan."
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaebol+1 and also, Samsung Electronics is divided into its well-known consumer goods division (which makes phones, TVs, white-goods) and its Device Solutions division, which makes chips for the consumer goods division and other customers including Apple. These two divisions are in direct competition with each other and, as far as I understand, the DS division does not give preferential treatment to its brother. Chaebols are interesting like that.So if Samsung did Apple would look for a different supplier to combat competition. Why aren't they looking for a different supplier to combat competition already? More expensive? In that case Apple is only Samsung's customer because they're the cheapest and if they sold chips to competitors for next to nothing Apple would need to pay more in order to make Samsung lose chip-business, which begs the question why they aren't doing this already rather than prolong Samsung's grip on their chip-supply.The branch of samsung that supplies their chips isn't in direct competition with them, that's the point. Yeah they even have a division of samsung that makes and sells Samsung cars Yeah, the big Chaebols are similar to big Japanese companies like Sony. It's not uncommon to see one division of Sony actually sue another division.Which also makes me believe the whole article doesn't make sense. Apple has some good projections on how many mobiles they will sell and whatever else they need from Samsung. They make agreements on delivery these chips and these are some serious amounts. So it's pretty much a given that like any other agreement that if Samsung wouldn't live up to the agreement they would get a serious penalty."
"At the same time Samsung is huge and I seriously wonder how much the impact of 1 successful mobile would have on their production line. If the S6 would be very successful and can disrupt, then why this wouldn't happen before with other products by other parties if they were suddenly demanding more then expected."
"Nah... funny article but unless someone with some insight in chip production can shed some light on how this works I seriously doubt it.Samsung hasn't been making large scale SoCs for awhile now and they're the only ones on a 14nm process.  Concerns about output capabilities are relevant >14nm"
"For comparison, pentium IIIs were 130nm. Die have shrunk tenfold since 2000.They are different divisions. They generally don't try to cannibalize sales from another division. The reason Samsung survives is diversification. Even when the mobile division has been going down in recent years, the others keep the company as a whole afloat. Apple is their semiconductors division's largest client. They aren't going to just balk on a contract. Samsung isn't going to be able to cover the losses from Apple by selling their own product. If people want the iPhone, they will wait for them. Not just suddenly pick Samsung. They have nothing to gain from trying to screw over Apple by not meeting production needs. It may cause even more clients to distrust them and find alternate suppliers. Bad business to let one division's goal ruin another independent division.Which comes back to what I previously mentioned, both parties are fully aware of their expectations and legally they are probably bound tight together for not allowing any disagreements between each other. This isn't like either party does something new, they know fully what they committed to. With it, I find it impossibly to believe that Samsung would short Apple allowing for probably legal punishment and to be considered an untrustworthy supplier. And especially the latter to be branded that could have serious consequences also towards other clients (future) from Samsung.People don't seem to understand 'Samsung' is just the umbrella company and the company that sells chips to Apple is not the same company that sells the GalaxyWell in this case they're the same company : Samsung Electronics. Yes, Samsung makes all kinds of shits but the company that makes Galaxy and the one makes Exynos/A9 chips are happens to be the same one."
"Interestingly enough Samsung display is a separate company. This! Samsung semiconductors bids for the contract for the Galaxy chips the same way any other company would, this is why some versions of the galaxy had other processors in the past, and sometimes they source the memory chips too. [deleted]That really doesn't diversify it enough. They sell food, they sell clothing, I'm pretty sure they sell furniture.They also sell cars and death robots standing guard at the DMZ. The reach is mind-boggling.They're also in banking, insurance, hospitality and health care."
"I'm not kidding. I didn't realise how massive Samsung was.Oil tankers, artillery, medical machinery, etc. They make it all.And, weapons. A whole lot of weapons.Have you tried the whole new Samsung AK47? They say it's great on the inside but the edges make it easy to break.I've heard there's a firmware update coming out for it soon that reloads it when you put it in the microwave.[deleted]I want a tank with NFC and wifi.

"> Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge smartphones will exceed sales expectations, according to a new note from KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, and that could hurt Apple&#039;s access to the A9 processors that Samsung produces for the next-generation iPhone."
"> Samsung needs all the good news it can get - its sales after the launch of the older Galaxy S5 models went into decline, so if the S6 range really is taking off - as Kuo says - then Samsung is likely to favor its own phones over those of Apple."
"> Kuo says that Samsung is expected to raise its shipment guidance for both the S6 and S6 Edge for the full year by roughly 40%, to 50-55 million units In the note, Kuo says the main driver is strong demand for the higher-end Galaxy S6 Edge device, which has a curved screen."

">Apple is worried that if Samsung's manufacturing unit will prioritize its Galaxy range over its orders."
"When did Apple say that? In what context? Is it a direct quote or an analyst's prediction?

I thought there were some indian mass produce press release click bait machine, but it turns out they are some news wannabe in NYc.[deleted]BGR back then was completely different to how it is now. "
"Back then it was just him and he used to get a lot of big scoops, especially to do with RIM/Blackberry. Then he sold to a media firm for millions and it turned in to BI-lite. Seriously.

Seriously the worst site on the tech scene.BuzzfeedinsiderThis is pure silliness. This article is bullsht.Ugh, I hate clicking on business insider without realizing it's business insider (tech tabloid).Samsung makes money from every Samsung and apple phone sold.  That's a damn good position to be in.**Samsung Semiconductor** makes money from every **Samsung Electronics** and **Apple** phone sold. They're in the same family but they're not the same company.This post is incorrect, Samsung Semiconductor & Communications is part of Samsung Electronics and has been so since Samsung Semiconductor merged with Samsung Electric in the 80s. The two are different divisions within side Samsung Electronics Co (see their quarterly [report](http://www.samsung.com/us/aboutsamsung/investor_relations/financial_information/downloads/2014/2014_business_quarter03.pdf) for a breakdown). And Microsoft makes money from every android phone sold... Stuff is weird sometimes. Patents make it really weird, but Samsung is winning on hardware too."
"I thought some of the big boys just had open patent agreements.This is pure bullshit.  Apple would have a contract with Samsung's semiconductor production house to produce the chips for them and would have information in the contract about meeting certain numbers.  Just because another arm of the company has a phone that uses a similar chip is doing well they wouldn't stop work on another customer's order to work on their own stuff.  This article reeks of shit.I'm sure Samsung will cut pretty much any other phone production before cutting the S6 or iPhone 6 CPU."
"Especially the crappy low end phones they make.Those low end phones are on a different process, the only ones using the 14nm are the high end flagship phones.  There is no other phones to really cut and samsung has priority because they had the contract first, apple is buying for next generation so they have not even likely finalized the contracts.Pure clickbait. The original article this is pulled from lays out three factors, including "
">  GlobalFoundries' A9 chip yield rate is said to currently be at about 30 percent yield rate, which is well below what Kuo said is a mass-production basic requirement of 50 percent."
"And "
">TSMC's competing 16-nanometer FinFET Turbo design has exceeded Apple's expectations in both yield rate and performance.I work in the industry.  Companies will absolutely make chips on 30% yield and attempt to crank up volume production.  Foundries will do almost anything to secure a contract, especially if they have the available capacity.  That's not to say it's ideal, but companies will absolutely do it.lol just some more predictions from an analyst."
"These are the types of people that said the PC is dying, netbooks are the future, tablets will replace PCs, smartphones are not needed (this would be around a decade ago), Android would not be a hit, etc.This type of articles is starting to get boring."
"Its more like of false advertising."
"They create this mindset that there is ahigh demand which they can't cater to."
"Funny thing is that every device which is short in supply always ends up being on the shelfs for a really really long time.Samsung might make more money from selling Apple components than they do from selling their own phones.Samsung doesn't care, it's making money either way."
"But not delivering to Apple could make them vulnerable to lawsuits for breach of contract.Not just lawsuits, it sends a clear message to their clients: We're looking out for #1, fuck our other obligations. Everyone they supply gets to re-negotiate at some point and reliability is usually a top requirement. If there is any question about their commitment they will likely get cold feet.riiiight... i'm sure apple's production contract with samsung allows the latter to say sorry man, we're too busy to do your stuff right now."
"samsung is a chaebol.  they're a literal megacorporation, involved in many major industries.  the fact that a small part of them happens to make phones means as fuck-all to the part of them which makes processors as it does to the part which builds ships or the part which sells life insurance.Wait... the chips for the iPhone are made by Samsung??They're designed by Apple but since they don't have the factories to fabricate their own chips it's done by whoever can supply them the cheapest or in highest volume. That tends to be Samsung. Yes. They supply a lot of other parts for Apple, most notable being displays and SSDs. what should apple fanboys feel about this?The company that sells chips to Apple is not actually the same company that sells Samsung Mobile brand phones.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Electronics"
"Yes it is.You're right, I probably heard it wrong somewhereNothing, because Samsung doesn't actually design it. I don't hate Samaung, I'm just not a fan of their software. [deleted]Samsung mechanical drives were mostly always made by Seagate. It's why they suck."
"However, Samsung SSDs are separately designed, manufactured, and sold by Samsung Semiconductor.What happened to not using Samsung produced materials? Is it because they can't find enough vendors to replace the volume Samsung could produce at?I guess so. I thought apple was designing and building its own fabrication plant. Might just not be ready yet.Its because samsung makes the best hardware, pretty much nobody else comes close, if you want top quality you go to samsung.  They could have a lower quality screen and SSD if they went somewhere else but apple would have a hard time justify not using the top quality components.High up in company's like Apple and Samsung the little fanboy wars don't exist. Samsung signs a deal with apple because they don't give a shit. Samsung as a whole makes money from every iPhone sold AND every galaxy phone sold. That's a great position. They wouldn't turn that away just because oooh apple. "
"Same with apple. It's a business deal. "
"Samsung displays are currently superior to other display manufactures. Lg is close behind. Samsung is also a very good chip fabricator.I'm not 100% sure as to why but generally Samsung displays have less problems and SSDs have better preformence. Samsung SSD's (at least the consumer-grade models) regularly out-perform most other SSD's on the market.Welp... TIL, I guess.Doubt it. Usually, this is when iPhone 6 sales start to taper off in preparation for the 6s or whatever they're gonna call it. Apple knows production can be ramped up. Non issue I think....Samsung will make more money still making chips for Apple.Based on the article the switch is most likely 100% about the chip apple will used next.  Which will likely be a TSMC chip.  Thus they want to start dipping their toes and ordering some chips from TSMC before they go all the way in.Here is a word cloud of all of the comments in this thread: http://i.imgur.com/CDNi6gC.png  "
"[^source ^code](http://github.com/Winneon/makeswordclouds) ^| [^contact ^developer](http://reddit.com/user/WinneonSword) ^| [^faq](https://github.com/Winneon/makeswordclouds#faq)Working in corporate has made me realize how much competition works directly with one another We, the normal consumer people, also see the effects of competition. Take it to the IT market. Years ago there were battles to be fought for fastest graphics cards, fastest cpu. Now a cpu camp and gpu camp won (I believe this to be true) so basically all you see are some weak iterations of a previous product. I'm sure in those camps there is still the R&D going on but without competition they don't need to switch technology. Good Guy Samsung: In direct competition with Apple. Makes parts for Apple anyway.Extremely unlikely this is going to be a problem, but I'm going to laugh my butt off if there is a problem and Apple ends up switching to Snapdragons.When the cell phone wars finally settle, I'll still be happy over here with my HTC.Why does apple buy stuff from Samsung?Apple doesn't actually make things. They design them and pay other people with manufacturing know-how to do the buildy-buildy stuff."
"Samsung started pretty much just doing the buildy-buildy stuff and transitioned into also making their own things."
"Long story short, Samsung still makes lots and lots of things. Some of which Apple buys.So who from Apple said this? How can you prove the S6 will sell more than expected?it already sold 10 million unitsHaven't read the story, but just from the title my response is, if you're concerned... don't announce it publicly! If Samsung didn't realize this before, you've just put the thought into their heads.So samsung can slam apple at anny time?Apple should have just bought Motorola and made their own chips.Apple just has to make better products, then people might start buying them again. Problem solved. I don't feel bad for apple. They could do the hard work instead of buying other peoples components.The Samsung s6 is doing better because contracts are up from the s4I had no idea Samsung made the chip for iPhones. Huh. The more ya know I'm just pissed the S6 doesn't have a removable battery, and SD card.  They also got rid if the waterproofing of the S5.  So stupid!Agreed. I bought the S5 because it was water resistant and had a removable battery. These two features we huge for me because I often will spend the day away from home on long runs and bike rides and I use my phone to track my progress, heartrate and play music. I burn through battery doing this so it is nice to be able to just pop my battery out and drop a new one in. I also like to load up SD cards with music and swap them out on occasion. "
"All these features made me not once consider an iPhone, because I can't live without them. Exactly!  I won't be buying the S6 because of these changes.  I'm a bit upset that it's apparently doing so well as I don't want all companies to lock-down their phones.Waterproofing I feel you. That sucks. But who actually swaps their battery out? I know a couple people with Android phones and they never do. I swap my batteries out constantly. And so does my wife. It is really nice to never have to tether your phone to a charger, just keep spare batteries around and swap when it is going dead. We both have three batteries. I actually have three batteries.  I bought a spare with a charger, then my brother gave me his old one.  It's invaluable on work trips (I travel a lot), where I might not be able to plug in all the time.  Also, have you ever run out of juice on a late-night at the bars, at a concert, or at a sporting event?  I don't."
"Also, if I'm charged, I can lend my spare out to friends who don't have one.  Spares are also very cheap, and having a built-in batt replaced is expensive.I just have a mophie case. 120% extra battery life. That's another option, but how much did it cost?  My total battery investment is probably under 30 bucks, and that's likely a liberal guess. "
"Edit:  This includes charger, and shipping100 bucks. But I'd rather have a seamless phone than be able to swap batteries. Good thing we all have options. And with the S6, we lose them :(I always buy a spare battery and keep it charged.  Many of the S5 docks out there sport a spare batter slot.  It's even better than having a battery pack, as there's no charge time, just swap it and go.I hate the fact that within 9 months of owning a phone, I need a new battery.  I can get OEM batteries for less than $40... Now how much was it again to send the device in to have a battery replaced?  I know Apple was charging $128 for the 3GS way back when...How much will Samsung charge?*rips off shirt, flexes, then slaps an iPhone out of someone's hands* Don't worry, buddy. I know a guy.Maybe apple should make their own damn chips then. Maybe Apple shouldn't rely on Samsung to make their chips.....uhh...yeah and how many chip fabs exist in the world...it's about 5, and Intel doesn't do outside work> and Intel doesn't do outside work"
"http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/foundry/overview.htmlWhy doesn't Apple make its own chips?  Why are they outsourcing to their biggest competitor?Because Apple doesn't make any chips. They just design them and contract out the production. There are very few companies in the world that do. ARM doesn't even make its own chips.I don't deny his. Just find the whole situation ironic "
"So sue 'em. /sWhy not?  Sell chips to apple, sell phones to people.  Get paid twice.Well gee, maybe they shouldn't have bought parts from their competitor.Most companies who buy products have a second source agreement that states if the supplier can't build to the agreed upon quantities, they have to release their designs to another company who can make the product. "
"If Apple didn't do this properly, it's their own fault. Why doesn't apple just make their own? I just want Amazon to fulfill my S6 order...Good..... goooood..Still weird for me that Samsungs making things for Apple, a competitor. Well if it rakes them big money why not eh.. Edit: i just answered my own question Can't happen because Samsung's phone division and chip division are separate entities.And this is the same Samsung they are constantly suing?Concepts like corporations can't be worried. [deleted]watch ?Haha, misread title. My apologies. Deleting now. This title got me hungry.Damn, didn't even know the S6 was out yet. I seem to be on the odd numbered galaxies, but I'm so pleased with my S5 thus far I'm wondering if I'll even feel the itch to upgrade when the S7 comes out.Biggest thing I noticed playing with one in shop was the fact that the six swipes pages is reduced to three."
"I also love my 5.You don't just up and move fabs on a whim. You have to design a chip for a specific fab. Samsung probably got backup plans, not having enough chips for Apple would cost Samsung a lot!So Apple went back to Samsung for a9 chips?When you source externally this issue is imminent, Apple seriously needs to fix its vertical integration.clickbait from shit-tier rag Business Insider? must be /r/technology"
"Tim Cook was COO of Apple for a decade, the odds of this being an issue are precisely zeroDafuq? Samsung made the chipsets for their competitor? This is exactly where and how the iPhone is made"
"http://financesonline.com/uploads/iPhone-infographic.jpgWow, that graphic is depressing.  I mean, think of all those people in China whose lives consist of:"
"* wake up in the factory dorm"
"* eat factory-provided breakfast"
"* work 12 hour shift doing monotonous assembly work"
"* eat factory-provided dinner"
"* sleep"
"* repeat"
"7 days a week, nearly every day of the year.  I'm sure there are a handful of holidays, but nothing like we get in America - not to mention what most of Western Europe dictates for PTO."
"I think I'd kill myself if that was as good as life ever got.So you better buy one before we run out ( deg [?]? deg) - AppleAnyone else think it's funny that the new S6 is more iPhone-like (non removable battery, no SD slot, metal casing) and is suddenly selling better?For those wondering why Samsung 6 is doing better than Samsung 5, IMHO a huge selling point of Samsung 6 is that it is running Android version 5 which has tones of new features.>it is running Android version 5 which has tones of new features"
"Your point?  So do Samsung S5's, or I should say that most carriers in the US now offer Lollipop upgrades to their S5 phones.  IMHO, the two top reasons why S6 seems like it will ultimately outsell the S5 are 1) better build quality and 2) end of the 2yr contract cycle for the wildly popular S4.Such tripe. Samsung Semiconductor (as in the bit of Samsung Electronics that makes chips) is for all intents and purposes a completely separate company to the one that manufactures phones. It's set up like that for Samsung's benefit - allows the business to take contracts like the one with Apple. And they will have a contract to manufacture by X date that will bare no relation to how the Galaxy S6 is performing. "
"Source: Work for Samsung Semiconductor's UK PR agency. Please do not share Business Insider and think it's a valid source for news I bet you BGR and The Verge don't report on thiswell a simple solution to that is make your own fucking chips.Each division of Samsung is basically a different company. The people that work for 'Samsung Chips' probably barely know the people working in the 'Samsung 'Phone' division. Huge scopes of work are put out to bid by company's like Apple and Samsung won the contract to supply. Each division of a company like Samsung works on it's own cash flow basis and the bottom lines are added into the main Samsung company to make it a whole. Go to Intel, Apple!!!I'm still pissed that Verizon and AT&T have been removing the Microsoft apps that I was promised from all their S6s.Lol that isn't Samsung's fault. T-Mobile yoDid i say it was Samsungs fault? Fuck T-Mobile. I'm never buying an S6, i'm just pissed that the carriers are removing Microsoft products from phones. The only decent software on the fucking brick.Well you're an angry fucker. T-Mobile is the shit I'll have you know, and my nexus 6 is chock full of cool shit. You might like it, but wait, if you want the pure android experience you'll have to get... T-Mobile. I am an angry fucker, an angry fucker who doesn't like Android at all. I will retract my Fuck T-Mobile statement. They're pretty alright in my book, that said I'm on Cricket so I can play around with whatever GSM phone I want just as easily. Slower data perhaps, but much cheaper.It's cool I'm an angry fucker who really misses symbian and where maemo was going but then Microsoft bought (killed) Nokia. I even bought a blackberry classic when it came out but the horrible Bluetooth problems killed it. you have to go tmob it seems for a vanilla experience. such a shame but expected.Isn't that exactly the risk you run when you contract your largest competitor to be a parts supplier?Apple would be stupid not to have a second source contract for these chips.The problem is not many people can make them, samsung is the only one doing 14nm, you could compromise and go with 20nm but you end up slower and with worse battery life.I picked up my s6 today. It feels shockingly like an iPhone..... might be a reason its doing better. No they are not worried. Apple should start making it's own chips.The last thing Samsung should do is cut back on iPhone chips due to a quarter with better than expected sales. lol. No matter what Samsung wins.No they aren't So there's no evidence whatsoever for the title, it's basically made up. Apple is moving some production to a different supplier, that's it. There could be a million different reasons, some of them even actually cited in the article. The idea that this is somehow about the Galaxy S6 is a complete fantasy made up by one analyst mentioned in the article."
"No problem. Apple can just double the price of the iPhone and sales will drop by 10% and there are enough chips to go around. Problem solved.Apple has a well establilshed history of starting partnerships with companies and then fucking them over.  There were companies licensed to make Mac clones, but when they sold too well, Apple pulled the rug out from under them.  Then the same thing with HP licensed to build branded iPods."
"So now apple is finding out what it's like to have a company decide it's not in their best interests to help Apple out.  cry me a river.Don't forget Motorola/iTunes So to be clear, samsung removed the replaceable battery AND the insertable SD card and they're selling better than expected? That's sad.Fandroids are quietly ignoring these changes after years of trolling iPhones and their users. Also, it bends.Yes, because although places like /r/technology and /r/android judge a phone based on those two features, many of the people buying  the phone aren't going to miss them and would prefer a nicer looking premium phoneThere are unibody premium phones that have microsd slot. Just like the samsung s6 has the sim slot there, another slot at the side or just behind it could be possible. But they want to sell the higher memory version so that's not going to happen."
"Hopefully the note 5 will have mucrosd slotApple is not worried about anything.If they can't get the components for their phones, yes they would be."
"The logistics of changing a vendor for components on an already designed product like the iPhone aren't as easy as googling a chipset vendor and putting X million of them in your cart.[removed]Genuinely sorry i buy products you don't approve of. Please forgive me.I don't see what the big deal is about the GS6 though, especially in comparison to the GS4/5. "
"There are no special features that distinguish it from the older phones, other than appearance. And maybe a bit of speed."
"(Typing this from the GS6 I pointlessly upgraded to)Wait til the Gear VR launches in may (according to lots of rumours).s6 is junk.Worried.... That's funny How is the S6 doing good? The reasons why I stayed with android is because I can remove the battery if mine dies and have extra storage space. Mobile employee here; not sure why you're getting downvoted. The s6 is not water resistant, does not have a replaceable battery, and does not have expandable memory. The mismatching colors between the button and the phone itself drive me crazy, and the external camera saw no improvements beyond the s5. At a consumer level, there seems to be very little interest in the phone and frankly I'm not surprised. I declined the option to upgrade from my s5. I don't care what anyone says, this phone just did not offer anything I want other than a sharper display.I am getting down voted because Reddit gets mad when I don't like something, but this is a price of tech. Also yes I only had a s3 and I am staying with LG because of the reasons said before. > At a consumer level, there seems to be very little interest in the phone"
"Is that why they've sold a million of them already?Wow, you would not be downvoted if you wrote that a year or so ago... People change their minds I guess. Yea, beats me. No external SD card is the killer for me. It's pretty much the main reason I switched over to android in the first place.For what it's worth, in 13 years I've never replaced a phone because of a battery issue. I always get the new phone when my contract runs out though so I'm sure that plays a part. Either way. I'm on my 3rd iPhone now and have never had a battery issue. Also I'm sure the new phones are better... But I wasn't a big fan of my old flip and slide phones with batteries because the backing a would slide off when I pulled it out of my pocket.For me its more about the expandable memory. i own a go pro & it saves having to plug my camera into a computer to look at the photos & videos, i can just put it in my phone & straight to instagram or facebook. Plus once you own 2 or 3 micro sds you can keep one empty & fill one with music or apps. Then if you are going to disneyland for a day switch them out & you can take 1000s of photos & videos. Though i can see how for some people its not that big of a deal> For what it's worth, in 13 years I've never replaced a phone because of a battery issue."
"This is almost completely based on the fact that there weren't any high resolution screens back then."
"Even your iPhone right now doesn't have the high resolution a lot of Android phones have and which causes more battery drainage (not always, but a lot of the time). Hence a switchable battery is a nice plus to have."
"Oh I see! you mean running out of battery. Yea that's true. I guess I could also use my extended battery pack, but I do see a benefit for replacing it completely.>Oh I see! you mean running out of battery. Yea that's true. I guess I could also use my extended battery pack, but I do see a benefit for replacing it completely."
"I carry three spare batteries for my Note 3. A replaceable battery is a must for me.Could you describe your daily usage that requires three spare batteries? I'm genuinely curious. We aren't talking about finding an outlet at the end of the day. We're talking about the battery being the shortest living component rendering the rest of the phone worthless when it dies.How is that? Well because not that many people actually care about that stuff.Is it that hard to understand that other people have needs that differ from your own?For some, it probably is. Tough shit, Apple."
"Use some of the half-a-trillion-dollars you're sitting on and open your own chip fab if you can't properly manage your supply chain.[deleted]Who has innovated recently in the phone space?Googles Project Ara is one to keep an eye out for.Samsung just made a new flagship phone without a removable battery and expandable storage. Such innovation."
"[deleted][deleted][deleted]Won't they be using a different chip than the S6?"
"Apple spends all their money on Design and Marketing. Than they put bargain tech which was slightly better than the previous model and charge consumers top dollar for their shit."
"Its been their business model for years now. Throw in a small bit of innovation into a pretty package and people eat it up.Innovation lol.The S5 missed projections because it wasn't much of an improvement on the S4. Sure it had waterproofing, USB 3.0, and fingerprint scanner, but none of those features are sellers."
"The S6 is an actual improvement.How? I'm geniuniley curious. People have been posting that the camera is the same, they've removed external memory, and removable battery. Seems like it's got a fancier case is all. What else is improved?This title sums up everything I despise about American capitalism."
"People go on about iPhone vs Android, and Apple is laughing all the way to the bank while Samsung gets paid no matter what you buy. Two major competitors are essentially partners and cornered a majority share in their respective market.The galaxy s6 edge is a freaking sick phone. are there still people who chose the iPhone over better smartphones?It's pretty crass to compete with a customer, but I guess they decided to hop into bed with each other anywayIn 6 months....  There are reports of an unexpected rise of depression and suicide among wealthy people in NY and LA.  Without apple, we cannot judge our self worth.Need to know samsungs production capability, and how apple actually feels about it. Conclusion BULLSHITI liked the camera but I have to say I was unimpressed with the S6.  That all glass body feels like crap to hold Typically what they've lied and cheated to prevent in the past. Maybe they'll risk recruiting child labor again?Why doesn't Apple just produce their own chip?Yup, look up the hollow corporation principle."
"This isn't the 50's anymore, companies don't produce stuff from start to finish."
"The big name designs and markets the product, many 3rd party suppliers and manufacturers build, store and ship them."
"I think Nike was a pioneer in this area.No they're not. They have something called a contract.And of course you know exactly what this contract says ...I don't need to know exactly what the contract says. I know they're not idiots and there will be clauses surrounding failure to deliver what they promise. It's the basis of any services rendered contract.They will most likely have set a minimum quota which isn't enough because the iPhone 6-sales are higher than expected.Their lawyers aren't this stupid.Neither are Samsung's.Exactly, so this article is stupid. No one is worried.I don't buy Apple products and never have and other than one unrealized purchase I don't own Samsung products and never have. That SSd was a rapid purchase and I was going off reviews without reading brands. Then they killed that with firmware So I don't have it Anymore. As such I rather both companies didn't exist."
"But the point is that I don't support either company due to their sweatshop conditions for production being very highlighted and obvious."
"So really my only option has been Microsoft or Google products and so I've used android for a while now. Though, my phone doesn't really use apps as they all seem stupid or useless other than a notepad or banking app. I also never really got much use with ROMS so I stopped doing that. But the Android phone works so there's that. I don't mind supporting Microsoft via that.I just had the worst three days of my life, I just bought a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Smartphone. Nothing smart about this phone, I have been on the phone with T-Mobile for hours trying to get this phone to work. The Welcome screen gets stuck and it won't let you get past the WiFi screen. T-Mobile won't admit that something is wrong, they just keep giving me the run around. The last support person told me to call the manufacturer (Samsung) because she did know what to do.  They told me to take it to a T-Mobile store, I bought this darn thing on the T-Mobile website,  now, they want me to run around to find someone to fix it. BTW, there is no T-Mobile stores in my area. This looks like a great phone, I really like for it to work.Doesn't samsung always outsell apple?"
"Edit: downvote my looking up statistics, quickly. [deleted]At least not in the US, samsung's lower end phones do outsell iPhones, but that's not a valid comparisonAre you saying this chart is fake then ?  "
"http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GS243_samapp_GR_20150129231408.jpg or perhaps you have an odd definition of neverWeird, just checked the stats and someone has since changed it last I checked. Before it used to say apple was almost always in third globally, Asian markets buying mainly samsung apparently, but the new stats have padded the numbers to change that. That said 2013 samsung sold a total of 445 million phones and apple sold 150 million. "
"According to Wikipedia. "
"Edit: just looked at the annual sales by company. According to Wikipedia, samsung always sells more than apple. I love that people downvote you without actually finding out what you said was true. Guess you struck some sort of nerve.Well, it goes both ways. Either they think i'm a fanboy getting som apple hate on, or they are. Thats what you get for being anti-american you apple cunts. dey took our jerbs. Guess its time for apple to spend some of its cash on hand and buy Intel. Til apple has Samsung make key chips for their flagship phoneBeen common for quite sometime... and while Apple does manufacture some of their own chips, primarily their A series of processors, they'd never be able to keep up with demand if they had to do entire chipsets. It's for this reason that I don't think Macs will be going ARM anytime soon... though, looking back at the mess IBM got into with the G5 and Motorola, in its original attempts to create a successor to the m68k, it's comical how Apple always ends up having chip issues. "
"And before anyone accuses me of bashing Apple, I'm typing this on a 2009, 17 Macbook Pro.Apple has enough money to make the problem go away if needed. If there are any apple execs on here please please buy AMD please please I have some shares :)AMD's culture is the polar opposite of Apple and even Intel at least in their CPU division.One thing to consider is the fact that these are the two biggest names in phones. Why does Samsung make chips for it's competitor? well think about this, if they said they wouldn't they would then be declared a monopoly which is illegal, and likely would be forced to break into two companies, one that makes the phones and one that makes the chips. But they are doing the smart thing and instead taking in all that money from Apple to make components for the iphone. "
"Also I think a lot of you people do not realize how products are actually manufactured. one company doesn't just make their product anymore, they are going to buy components from all over the world to go into their product in the cheapest way possible, and then for their proprietary work they make it in house OR outsource it to a contract manufacturer like apple does with iphones. This kind of thing is common. When jobs was running things, I thought they would pay for chips years in advance to corner the market?Yup, this article is bullshitPretty sure those were the exact things that Cook actually did.yea cook was the supply side guy.People certainly love wasting money.I no longer like either of those phone lines. Just nothing special about either one... Yes...let the butt hurt flow thru you.I have an upgrade ,What should I get the Iphone 6+ or the S6? Ready set go!Neither."
"The only thing Sony's new phones lack is a robust marketing campaign, check out the Z3 and Z3 compact. Incredible handsets."
"They had me at anything more than 1080p on a phone is ridiculous, we're sticking with 1080p and focussing on the longest possible battery life."
"I don't miss all the extra chargers i had to carry when i used Samsungs!If you're used to apple, and have bought a lot of apps on their store, probably stick with the iphone (although check it's not too large for you). If not, go with the S6 or maybe the Note 5.The S6 technically superior in every way. The screen is the best on the market and brightest ,thats a tested fact. And it has the worlds fastest SSD inside, 3-4 times quicker thany any other phone on the market, including Apple. And is the only phone on the market that can pay at ANY terminal, including old magnetic swype ones, that by itself is worth EVERY penny. "
"Overall, its a great phone."
"But if know nothing of phones and you just want to follow the crowd because other people have Apple.. i suggest you buy a iphone.Good. All hail our new Samsung overlords. ITT people learn Apple vs. Android really means Samsung or Samsung. [removed]Then get it replaced.Wait samsung makes chips for apple? Dafuk?And the computer parts for their MacBook's are made the same place Asus products are made.huh just shows how much i know or care about electronics. so just goes to show as long as it does what i need and it is cheap then fuck it i'll take it.Lol. Looks like Apple let the fox into the henhouse."
"didn't Apple sue Samsung? are they doing business now?"
"edit: why downvote? it was a legitimate question. Lawsuits are part of business, even between companies that are working together.They've been doing business this entire tiem.so they do business and sue each other?"
"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/31/apple-sues-samsung-for-2bn.....yep? You post that link like people are completely unaware of Apple's anti-competitive lawsuits."
"Apple pushing music labels to kill free Spotify streaming ahead of Beats relaunch[deleted]this this this!"
"i used to torrent A LOT.  It was annoying at same time, because i was so behind on new music.  But i torrented anyway, because well, i couldn't find an alternative.  Then someone introduced me to spotify and I haven't looked back.  Please don't take that away from me.What? New music comes out illegally the day it comes out legally, if it hasn't been leaked already.But you cant just open spotify in browser and hit play during work. Torrenting takes a bit more effort. "
"I listen to spotify when I go to work, work, leave work and same thing with gym after work. I aint gonna start torrenting when I get home in the evening if I could just open an app and hit play.s/he might be referring to the discover and related artists sections, among others, that can be used within spotify to stumble upon new music.I just get rid of apple all together by having an android phone and using google play music, which is awesome by the way.There will probably be a free option with Beats Music, Apple just wants to be the only one offering it.Which is weird, because Apple fought the music industry so hard to make all iTunes music DRM free. Ehh... By the time apple did it it was a moot point. They were one of, if not the, biggest music store online. I'd say it was a pretty big deal to get iTunes to DRM free. It made me go from never buying downloaded music to iTunes being my primary store. Were you not aware that DRM-free music was already available on Amazon and often for less money than iTunes?Sadly, I was not. Most of my music is in iTunes. I'm looking pretty hard at transitioning since Amazon offers it's cloud service. Still, if I want all my music up there it's yet another fucking monthly fee which just isn't going to happen. >Still, if I want all my music up there it's yet another fucking monthly fee which just isn't going to happen."
"I don't buy music anymore, but I preferred to buy it from Amazon.  As for storing it, I always used Google Music, which will store up to 50,000 songs for you for free.Google Play Music is awesome in so many ways. I still buy my music from a variety of sources (itunes for obscure foreign music, amazon and google for other stuff), but listen to it almost exclusively through either google play or my mp3 player (which I use when exercising).Thanks for the tip!They fought so hard Amazon did it before them.Export Spotify playlist > Convert it to YouTube playlist > use one of the bajillion websites out there that rips audio from YT videos. Tada!Yeah do they not remember the original iTunes which was successful be a use everybody had unlimited songs from napster? It's not really any different now. You can torrent the fuck out of new albums and import them into iTunes (and iTunes Match) and it will all work just fine. Apple doesn't give a fuck where you originally sourced the music-files from. Because. He was trying to say because. Apple doesn't realize this...they think since it's them behind the service people would rather use it than pirate..The thing is, given Apple's cult following, they may be right for some people.Exactly. I haven't illegally downloaded music once in the 3 years that I've had spotify. I've even bought songs I couldn't find on Spotify because I've saved so much money on most the of the music I listen to by using spotify that I am happy to pay for the songs I can't get through the service.  As soon as I lose my easy access to music, I'll probably start stealing my music again.  "
"It might rub people the wrong way that I demand easy access to my music, but there is no reason to make music hard to obtain nowadays... unless you're like Wu-Tang and never want your fans to hear your album because ART IS RARE AND BEAUTIFUL, AND MUSIC IS ART SO MUSIC SHOULD BE RARE. 100% this. I haven't torrented a single album since I got spotify premium 4 years ago. I feel like less of a piece of shit and sleep better at night. However, I'm not above going back if they fuck this up for me. I go to enough live music to go back to rationalizing that shit. What kills me is that none of these companies seems to give a shit about radio, where they don't even really get compensated based on the number of plays the song gets, it's just a set monthly or yearly fee.Radio plays the songs that big corps want them to play. They pay the radio stations to get airplay for certain songs a certain number of times a day. You might hear a single that they are pushing played every 40 minutes or so. The main reason they have gone after streaming services and filesharing is that other music acts get the customer's money rather than the music that gets pushed by the record companies. More money is spent on media today than before filesharing. The corps are just upset that their former advertising strategies do not work as well as they used to so the big corps get a smaller chunk of the money people spend on music and other media.So, how do we all become radio stations?Streaming can be done by anyone with an internet connection. The fact that streaming is harder for the record companies to control is why they go after streaming services for money but they pay radio stations to play certain songs they want to advertise.Serious question?"
"You have to pay a licensing fee to the RIAA and to the FCC. And you need to get the radio equipment."
"That's pretty much it."
"I guess technically, you can skip the FCC if you are broadcasting via the internet, but you'll need to check the rules on that one.If you don't want to play RIAA associated music you can avoid them as well.  >You have to pay a licensing fee to the FCC"
"Not if the low-power FM range is under 200 ft!  Take that, Apple!  Of course at that power, it's basically just a garage door opener.  "
"Alternatively, you could set up a Carrier Current Station (a.k.a. Campus Radio), operating between AM 535 and 1705 kHz.  I don't know what's easier - dealing with FCC regulations or setting up your own school so you can broadcast.  "
"South Harmon Institute of Technology - let's make it happen!I would pirate 100% of my music if Spotify was killed. I tried iTunes and Apple's services for a length of time and absolutely hated it. Nothing against people who use Apple for their music, but it is not for me. "
"Edit: A lot of people have mentioned Amazon/Google streaming services as an alternative, gonna give Google's a second lookDo you own an Android device?  Google Play Music All Access is pretty good from my experience with it.  It also ties in very well with other Google/Android features. Same. Paid spotify subscriber for 3 years. I'd go back to what.cd so quick. itunes is a terrible service, thats probably part of it.Seriously, do Apple fans even like iTunes? I can't imagine anyone liking it. I've used it consistently for years now, and have had very few problems. Why is it people hate it so much anyways? One of the primary reasons I use it exclusively is that I have no access to wifi at work and so I need to have hard copies of my music on my phone if I don't want absurd cellular data charges.One of the only reasons I used it was because I used an ipod and at the time didn't realize how ridiculous the album/song files are set up.  After I attempted to transfer my own personal music to a different PC that I purchased in CD form and it was all in thousands of gibberish files and folders I pretty much quit using anything apple.  Thank god I can just use my phone as an mp3 player nowadays, and if I could go back in time I would have told my younger self to buy a zune or some other mp3 player with a music playing program that doesn't use crippling DRM on music you purchased as it's default setting.The DRM has since been removed from iTunes music, but their organization is still bullshit. It's all just far too fiddly for someone that should just be a music purchasing option and music player.I've got an iPhone, MacBook Pro, and an iMac and I HATE iTunes. My brother who would be considered an apple cult member doesn't even like it. I eat drink and poop apples. My relatives on my fathers side are all apples. (Mothers side is more of a mixed fruit bowl) And I hate using itunes."
"Seriously why can't there be better integration with Amazon music like in my previous HTC android. Stupid iOSAnother problem is even if such practices by the big companies are deemed illegal, they just throw money at it.That's because it's so goddamn easy to buy legislation.They make 5 billion and get fined 5 million. Yeah that'll teach 'em!I wonder how serious their problems would actually be if they stopped throwing money at stuff.If the car industry is any example, the government will just throw money at the problem for them.Throw money at me! Get a government contractThis is just Netflix vs cable & Hollywood all over again."
"Is that over with now?Not really, Netflix had to shift towards more of their own programming as fewer companies are letting them buy their content.And netflix's content is, in general, better than most of the rest. A large part of that is due to the creative freedom afforded by not having to abide by broadcast decency rules. "
"You could make that argument for HBO, showtime and cinimax for the past 20 years. While they have traditionally had good content I wouldn't say it is on par with recent HBO shows (GoT silicon valley etc..) Or Netflix originals. No I think the reason that Netflix orginal content is so much better than traditional TV is because the writers/cast/story can remain consistent throughout the series. The writers/directors know the show can be watched in order and they don't have to worry about commercial breaks. Netflix also has the advantage on getting the whole season written before the first episode airs so if something needs to change it can change. "
"Tdlr: There are many obstacles to great story telling, decency restrictions is one of them. But IMHO it's not the one in play here.HBO definitely had great programs before now. The Sopranos, The Wire, Tales from the Crypt, Deadwood, Rome, and Carnivale were all great shows.Dont forget Curb!"
"And Entourage!Bloodline. Watch it people.I've heard it begins slowly, can you give me some opinions on why I should commit(Seriously, I love TV and need something new)Because you love TV and need something new sounds like good enough reason to me.Agreed. It sucks that they have to go on random cleanses of old shows they can't come to licensing terms with, but if more shows like Daredevil come out of it then I'm fine with that.Just started this series. Good stuff.Just finished it tonight! Amazing!Is all of it out or will there be more seasons?Not only will you get a new season of Daredevil next year, you're on track for at least one new Marvel Netflix show this year (AKA Jessica Jones, which will also include Luke Cage) and possibly a second (Iron Fist, which is still listed as a 2015 release although no date has been set). "
"Next year you will get at least S2 of Daredevil and Luke Cage's headlining series, and sometime (probably 2017), all four named heroes will join together in an Avengers-like team-up series called Defenders, who are sort of the street-level heroes that support the Avengers. "
"If Marvel and Netflix can continue the quality level set by Daredevil, I might actually be more excited for the Netflix series than I am for the movies, which seem to be generally following a trend of getting better with each iteration.More to come! Well, Netflix did end up paying extra which proves that comcast is using its monopoly power. The new Net neutrality rules will help if they can be enforced. Those rules will probably also lead to more competition in the ISP space at which point the big incumbents will have less illegal leverage.ISP competition is heavily inhibited by laws Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon helped pass in many states which make it nearly impossible to start a publicly owned ISP. For example, in Virginia, any publicly owned ISP has to pay back its infrastructure costs in the first year (which is inherently impossible) or it has to be shut down. [Read up on all the BS here](http://www.muninetworks.org/content/level-playing-field-0).the same infrastructure costs that we gave 2 billion in tax breaks to the major ISPS so they could build theirs?good thing in europe they would get fined to death. antitrust in europe. . no way. even google gets fined for using its power. but not everybody gets netflix :'(VPN?

"I'm not tech-savvy enough to know how it works.Netflix should come next year in Slovakia, or something like that. No it will not.. They said they couldn't care less.. Nothing will happen I am cheering for netflix, and hope they will stand their ground.The EU is working on that too. The plan is to have a single market and it will be illegal for them to block it. Of course... this will take time, distribution deals the studios and local distributors have will need to change, etc..that sux hard. yeah. well i tried giving them my money, i'll be back to torrenting stuff."
"and they will cry how much money they'll be losing on shows that will never be available in my country. Do they even logic? > vpn and proxy pirates"
"What *isn't* piracy these days? Are used movies and music still legal?Used? You mean expired license? /sTechnically used sales of a lot of media is illegal, depending on the EULA, especially regarding video games. Rentals are usually explicitly out of the question too."
"But nobody bothers to sue anyone over itin 35 years, even listening to slightly lound music in your car will be illegal, because you know, because people outside of your car *might* hear a lyric or two."

"Apple is now firmly in the realm of 90s microsoft. Making stupid choices and threats to get their way. Apple has been doing some shady business for awhile now. They were [price fixing](http://iphone.appleinsider.com/articles/14/07/16/apple-settles-ebook-price-fixing-complaint-with-states-consumers-could-pay-450m) ebooks with publishers and screwing consumers out of lower prices. And Microsoft is now the one making innovation, wow how times have changed...It's as if we actually need antitrust enforcement Yeah Microsoft is making some really good moves with open source, cross-platform C# and Windows 10. Pretty excited with their direction.That, and the surface pro series is an incredible step forward in portable computing. I recently bought a 3, and the battery life, magnetic keyboard and touch screen functionality are fantastic. They're not the only ones making progress in the area but I'm very impressed with what they've producedI'm hoping the Surface Pro 4 will be announced relatively soon because I've been thinking about making the change from my laptop.  Since I built a desktop PC about a year ago I only rarely use my laptop anymore, but I do still use my Nexus 7 relatively often despite the fact that I regret not going with a tablet with a larger screen.  I think a Surface would be a perfect middle ground between the twoA couple of years ago this would have been a great one linerHEY GUYS, THIS GUY ACUALLY READ THE ARTICLE! LOLBURN THE WITCH!HE TURNED US INTO A NEWT!Focused more on numbers than on innovation. It's a shame. Meanwhile Microsoft is releasing tools that make it easy to run Android/iOS apps on Windows, innovating hardware like the Surface Pro 3 and HoloLens, and giving Windows 10 upgrades for free. It seems the pendulum is swinging.To be fair, Microsoft has always had a MASSIVE R&D budget.  "
">During fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, research and development expense was $9.8 billion, $9.0 billion, and $8.7 billion, respectively. These amounts represented 13%, 13%, and 14%, respectively, of revenue in each of those years.  "
"[Investor Report](http://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar12/financial-review/business-description/research-development/index.html)An investment that pays dividends. Which is strange because Apple can afford put so much more money into R&D than they do. They've just been boosting it heavily in the past year or so, but they're still behind.Apple is not a really high tech company, they never spend money on R&D. They are big with marketing. This is the reason their patent number is so pathetic even until recently when they start upping their R&D money.Apple has (or perhaps had, not really sure) some straight up god-tier marketing people.  Their public image really is in all likelihood the single most important factor in their success.  All the extra money that goes into an apple phone/computer/etc. is, in my opinion, largely  resultant of their success in gradually coaxing consumers into believing that their products are inherently more 'high-class' or otherwise valuable than alternatives."
"It actually reminds me a lot of how incredibly expensive diamonds are despite the fact that they really aren't that valuable at all (we can literally create near-perfect diamonds synthetically at this point).  When people are told repeatedly that some given product is nicer/more prestigious they'll begin to value it more regardless of whether or not it provides any tangible benefits or utility.It's almost as if it was a symptom of being too big for your own good."
"Microsoft had to eat a big piece of humble pie between their former glory and where they are today, but I think they are a better company for it."
"Here's to hoping Apple goes in a similar direction.Oddly enough, Steve Jobs talked about this exact thing in an interview.  "
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBma82g3UagIt's the nature of technology. Companies innovate and overtake the market, then are outmaneuvered by smaller more agile competitors and resort to bureaucratic means to maintain their market rather than continuing to innovate. Happened with the telegram companies, then the telephone companies. IBM to Microsoft to Apple. It'll happen to Google as well. The question is if the company can survive their downswing. If Windows 10 is successful, MS can find themselves back in a very good position.Apple already went this direction. The company all but imploded for their closed-minded business philosophies in the past. Before those iMac commercials came along they were as insignificant as they'd ever been. It seems they are going back to their old habits.And no jobs here to save them now.Or Bill for that matter >_>Bill is now back to working part time at MicrosoftIn the mailroom. From the ground up!Jack Donaghy style.Pretty much, except now they're big enough to not suffer from it, at least for the time being. But also no Steve Jobs to come back and save them....I hope not. Spotify is single handedly responsible for me not torrenting music these days. I'd hate to lose that.I was like that with grooveshark.. I guess Spotify is swirling down the drain next?Grooveshark actually had questionable features that caused it to be shut down. Very interesting streaming service, but it was nowhere as professional as Spotify, nor as situated.Grooveshark was the reason I discovered and bought a lot of very obscure music Spotify doesn't have.Still not as legally situated at all. Just because they had access to these bands that didn't put their own music on spotify (which you can do), doesn't mean it wasn't in a position to be shut down. Spotify is what stops a lot of people from pirating music. If you don't provide a free alternative, people will turn to piracy. There are actually a number of studies linking piracy to availability/convenience and pricing.  "
"It turns out people are willing to pay for conveniently available, fairly priced things.  Who knew?Kinda like Netflix. Tons of people stopped pirating movies/TV shows because they were available on netflix for a reasonably affordable price, good quality and easily accessible.I stopped downloading because Netflix spoiled me with speed. Why should I download and start watching after 10 mins when I can load up Netflix and start watching in seconds? Oh and no hunting around for subtitles.Netflix is amazing, but it hurts me inside that they could be even more amazing by having a complete library of almost every single show ever produced, all at the best possible quality, organized properly, given metadata, subtitles, all available anywhere."
"And they can't due to bullshit from rightsholdersSpotify is just the radio to young people, stop stopping it and try to make more money of it's freeness.Isn't the free service the reason Spotify isn't profitable [Maybe.](http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-05-21/why-spotify-and-the-streaming-music-industry-cant-make-money)"
"> Scale is a magic word for so many cloud-based companies and services, but Beats and Spotify operate differently. Their margins don't improve as they get larger. If Spotify bought the rights to songs for a flat rate, then every subscriber it adds would mean free money for the company. But that isn't what it does. Instead, **it spends a fixed proportion of its total revenue on royalties. So if Spotify doubles its subscriber base, it doubles the amount of money it pays out.**"
"> According to a report published by Generator Research last November, the current business model for streaming music is inherently unprofitable. Andrew Sheehy, the main author of the report, concluded: Our analysis is that no current music subscription service--including marquee brands like Pandora, Spotify, and Rhapsody--can ever be profitable, even if they execute perfectly."
"> The company does say **its contracts are structured so about 70 percent of its revenue goes to royalties.**"
"Licensing is killing their profitability AND artist profits. The big record companies get their money without doing jack shit. Apple is probably trying to use their market power to get lower royalty prices."
"> Apple's interest in Beats is an acknowledgment of the changing times, says Rich Karpinski, a senior analyst at the Yankee Group. Everyone is waiting for Apple to make its move, he says. In some ways this validates the area. Apple declined to comment. The acquisition could tilt the balance of power in several ways. Apple could use its market power to force labels to accept lower royalty rates or entice its customers to subscribe to Beats by pre-installing the app on every device, dropping the price, and promoting it heavily through the App Store.The only ads I get are for spotify premium. It's absurd the ad space being wasted because companies don't get that we are the DJ's now via Spotify and it's the radio with a fee songs followed by an ad.What boggles my mind is when the ads they play are for genres of music I NEVER listen to. Spotify has all of the data around the music I listen to as evidenced by their Year in Review feature.  You would think that they could utilize that data to make their advertising more effective.To be fair in Latvia we have a ton of companies using spotify as an advertising platform.  IIRC even Latvian Railways used it for some of their safety PSAs. So it's not as a barren wasteland as it might seem.True, but I think what Apple wants to do is kill Spotify and co so they can get young people to listen to Apple's new version of the radio.I don't know about you, but I don't want to live in a world where someone else makes the world a better place better than Apple does.I finally understand a reference on Reddit! ^(where is the reference from? :()Silicon Valley.  Very funny show.Silicon Valley!This guy fucks, am I right?!"
"Edit: Holy shit! my first gold, to the person who gave it to me, you fuck the hardest!Lol that guy is something else.Haha i like that this comment is starting to appear all over the internet. You know Russ, I've been known to fuck myself. I don't do apple products so people like me will go back to torrenting like I did and still do. They're just going to fuck themselvesI've been an Apple product user for some time now and a Spotify premium user as well. If Apple were to shut down Spotify, I'd just go back to torrents and not paying for music again. The article is talking about Apple trying to shut down freemium services not premiumI still prefer pandora over apples radio service. "
"Maybe it's just a bias (though pandora seems to mix better), but I love pandora. Still the best radio service. Spotify is good and all if you know what songs you want, but pandora is just a better radio service (imo). Agreed. Pandora still has the best suggestions / exploration. I will forever prefer Songza because humans are really good at putting playlists together.That's why I prefer spotify, mixes normally don't work well for me. I want to control what I listen to. The pandora  algorithm starts to lose quality the farther you go into non mainstream music. It has a hard time with classical and jazz and their subgenres. Also I can pay to not have ads in spotify. I really hate ads between pieces of music, totally kills the vibe and flow. > Also I can pay to not have ads in spotify. "
"You can pay to have no ads on pandora as well."
"Yeah but you can't listen to a specific song. With Spotify you have their whole library plus b sides and singles and if they appeared on a compilation. Plus tour dates. When I 'discover' a band I like I just click to see if they're on tour. "
"The last dozen shows I've been to were bands I would have never even heard of without Spotify. And scrolling (decently timed) lyrics available on a lot of songs.And you can record the timings for lyrics, if they're missing them.Pandora is good if you want to hear everything except the song you typed in. I always thought Pandora was more of a discovery service. So playing the specific song you wanted wasn't the goal and instead, exposing you to new songs similar to the ones you already like.That's exactly how I use it. Whoever says people stop discovering new music after their late 20s or so clearly hasn't tried using Pandora.>Sources also indicated that Apple offered to pay YouTube's music licensing fee to Universal Music Group if the label stopped allowing its songs on YouTube."
"That's some straight up evil shit.Shame on Apple. Spotify figured out music. Move on. Tackle another challenge. Tim Cook, take a page out of Elon Musk's life.I don't understand what this means, can someone explain? Apple are willing to pay Universal the same amount YouTube currently pays them, just to take Universal Music off of YouTube.Jeez, Apple are just a bunch of greedy cunts. I always wondered how they get away with their shit. Been going on for years now. "
"Wasn't Microsoft fined shit loads of money for making IE the default browser, ok completely different, but Apple just trying to crush any competition unfairly. MS got in trouble for installing its own browser as the default on Windows, though users could always change it."
"Apple gets away with making their own browser, email client, SMS client, video call client, calendar, navigation, contacts, camera, photo gallery, etc, etc the default and users *cannot* change any of them to default to something else.  That's just the beginning though, since they also control all the hardware *and* the only app store.  They also control the largest source of content, and make it difficult or impossible to retain access to purchased content without continuing to buy their hardware.  No other company has ever had it so good."
"How? By being by far the most profitable company in the business, but technically not having a monopoly if you count users.  "
"For instance, this analysis showing that Apple's not monopoly is taking 93% of all profits from the mobile space:"
"http://m.barrons.com/articles/BL-TB-46610"
"Which is worse for consumers?  Which is more anticompetitive?  Seems clear to me that Apple is doing more harm than MS ever dreamed of during its most powerful days.That would hurt the labels more than anyone, I would think.  YouTube is... kinda popular.This is idiotic. Using the free version made me realize how much I liked the service. That turned me into a paid subscriber. I doubt I would have used it had there not been a free model. Guess it's back to piracy :3I never left.Hoist your colors![never shall we die](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-VoJvbTzk)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ju_10NkGY[Now with 100% more Scottish metal.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXoZsgNHquM)[Lime be the color for me!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAp0xO-LwFs)[Yarr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBH4g_ua5es)Yo ho! You are a pirate!This is so anti-competitive. Just like what they did with eBooks, this is so wrong.The article is actually about the doj and eu antitrust investigation that's going on because of it. "
"And because of the ebook thing,which they were found guilty of antitrust violations from, they have an antitrust monitor on campus which makes this move even dumber because they are going to be getting copies of literally every communication by executives to make sure they aren't pulling more bullshit. What did they do with ebooks? I think he's talking about [this](http://iphone.appleinsider.com/articles/14/07/16/apple-settles-ebook-price-fixing-complaint-with-states-consumers-could-pay-450m). Apple apparently inflated their prices a while back.They were found guilty of orchestrating the [price-fixing of ebooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Apple_Inc.) by having publishers set their own prices on the Apple bookstore (with Apple taking their usual 30% cut) while also requiring that they not be sold anywhere else for less. This was in the interests of publishers, who disliked Amazon discounting their ebooks and wanted to increase consumer prices. There's an appeal, I believe. I really miss the period between when I got my Kindle and when the iPad came out.  I could try lots of books for only a few dollars each.  Then this Apple thing came out and ebooks cost as much as print copies.http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/07/16/apple-settles-ebook-price-fixing-complaint-with-states-consumers-could-pay-450mThey colluded with publishers to prevent Amazon from offering deep discounts. "
"They are part of the reason that the price of books published through the big publishers are the same for ebook and paper.Though to be fair. In that game, everyone made an ass of themselves. Amazon for possible predatory pricing although they maintain it was loss leading. Apple for colluding and the publishers for telling apple to make the collusion happen because they couldn't get it together themselves[deleted]Yes, it is."
"I love my macbook, but I really hate Apple's business tactics.Then stop giving them your money. I hate apple, I envy their product design and quality  but I hate apple tactics.I hate my macbook. And I hate apple. [deleted]It's the fact that it's UNIX that I find Macs easier to deal with. I use a Windows machine for work and I hate it. Each to their own though I guess at least you haven't just slagged them off without using one for an extended period of time.Macs are more user friendly because everything not user friendly is hidden so deep you wont accidentally stumble upon it and be confused. Which for me has always been a pain in the ass cause I have always been above avg computer savy on a PC, but I cant stand my Mac.It's another os, some things are better, some worse."
"I enjoy it.I walk in both worlds, I'm a windows SA at work, and all mac at home. Sure Mac has it's quirks, but overall, it's a better experience. I've had friends/family I recommended switch over, and they've stopped constantly asking me to help them or fix their computers. "
"Just my experience, but I do get that sentiment of them being easier because I've seen it.It's simple like a unix os (it is a unix os), but has the applications that windows has. It also doesn't come loaded with a ton of shit that dell, hp, etc PCs come with."
"I know ~~people~~ /r/pcmasterrace are going to say well idiots should make their own computers but the truth is a lot of people don't and don't want to.  Know your consumer, don't try to change your consumer.Representative of /r/pcmasterrace here. Idiots should buy a far better, cheaper laptop from MSI, ASUS, or even RAZR. Starbucks regulars might beg to differ, but Apple aren't the only, nor the best makers of laptops.But the same reason a person buys a macbook is the kind of the same reason someone buys designers bags rather than a random bag.  (not saying that's a good reason to do something, but millions of people do it)"
"Personally, for most of my internet usage I prefer a chromebook.  Cheap as fuck, gets the job it was created for done.Props for the Asus suggestion. Have a touchscreen asus laptop and its badass and cost a fraction of mac priceI personally just bought the new Dell XPS 13 and I couldn't be happier. Only bloat that came on it was McAfee anti virus that was easily uninstallable.As someone who is pretty tech-capable, I enjoyed my 2009 MacBook Pro simply because it was less buggy. I never had any actual issues with it, unlike every single Windows OS computer I have ever used, and the battery life was far superior (at the time at least) to the Windows OS laptops on the market. Now that my MacBook is finally slowly dying, I think I'm going to switch to a Chromebook. But the reasons Macs are easier is just that they are less prone to issues that Windows OS computers have. And even though those issues are sometimes easily fixable if you know what you're doing, it's still easier to not have them in the first place.Woot for Chromebook. Does the one thing really, really well for cheap.Which issues specifically are you talking about? It's been years since I've had any problems with windows.Disagree. In my experience, Macs have a sweet spot that's pretty consistent whereas windows pcs tend to have a shorter sweet spot that can vary significantly based on who you're buying from, what model, and when. That's not at all to say that there aren't issues, just that they tend to show up later and are often fairly common, impossible to fix, and pretty blatantly ignored by apple. I've sent back HPs that crapped out on me, and they tended to know what the issue was for the product line but every problem I've ever encountered on a mac (or had a friend experience) has been typical enough to find a ton of hits on google, no official response, and every bit as annoying as windows problems. Add on that Apple makes it significantly harder to do any fixes yourself (hardware or software) and I've had a lot more frustration from their products."
"I'd also add that they're not really easier. They do the same things differently, and my parents are just as clueless about how to use their iPhones as they were on android, but due to marketing would never go back to android because it's too difficult.On that note. For any Macbook Pro owners who have faulty GPUs on 2011-2013 models, Apple [finally just acknowledged](https://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro-videoissues/) their motherboard issue and will now replace them. I work in the tech field and I was literally at the Apple store getting a Macbook Pro serviced the week before they announced this and I asked about the issue since one of the users I supported had it. They pretended to have never heard of the issue when I brought it up. This! god damn, a million times this.Try using them in an enterprise environment.  We took the Mac's away from everyone except the CEO, with the caveat that we will do nothing to support it.  Then some asshole bought apple TV's...There's nothing to support on an Apple TV. It's either on the network or not."
"To get them on WPA2 enterprise a configuration file must be created and managed with a Mac.  We don't have one and there are no other options.  To get content on them we want, we would have to dedicate a seperate machine to provide it. From the google searches i have done, the consensus is unless your network is already set up with apple devices in mind, best to look elsewhere.The thing I hate about my macbook is that I have a $2200 pro with great specs and it can't run a ten year old game smoothly (vanilla wow).Spotify is a godsend."
"Ffs...I'd pay $20 for my Spotify if I knew $10 of it was used to somehow fuck Apple.Good guy apple - using their massive warchest to stifle competition at every turn. Should we innovate this quarter? Nah, lets rip off someone else's idea - we're good at that.Apple is no saint, and while I enjoy their products, I am no fanboy...but ripping off others ideas? They may not have invented *everything* that goes into their products, but they have been at the forefront (often leading the charge) of nearly every major tech trend of the past 15 years.PC's, phones, music players and iTunes are not even close to nearly every major tech reel it in there fanboyWell that's exactly it. They take existing, newish technology and package it in a sneak and sexy way, then market it better than any one else. I'm not trying to bash them. Marketing is much harder to do than people give it credit for. And without Apple I think a lot of mainstream tech would still be considered niche and unimportant. That has caused everyone to innovate. So while I don't believe Apple is always directly pushing the envelope, they are usually shoving someone else into it. No they haven't. "
"They've been at the forefront of *refining* every tech trend in the past 15 years, but they've honestly pretty much never innovated anything. "
"They're amazing at marketing and they're good at making a super polished product that either a 9 year old or an 89 year old can use without issue. .. they're not so good at inventing. SSDs? Late to the game. USB3? Late to the game. Graphics options for laptops and desktops (nVidia/AMD), constantly late to the game. "
"The iPhone and iPad are simply iterations and design refinement of what were (long) existing ideas and technology. They leveraged their market position as a premium brand to be able to sell as very expensive product which gave them enough profit margin to actually make a good product (but again, at a fairly high price). They've ripped of every successful technology they've innovated on in the last 10 years, but that's pretty common practice. It was all existing technology, what I will give you, is that they are brilliant at packaging existing technologies and giving them market appeal. Brilliant design and marketing departments.I think they're really good at taking emerging technologies and apply them in such a way that they become mainstream. The research on multi-touch, taptic feedback, the friggin computer mouse was all started externally, but Apple took those things and built products in which those things truly shine. It's not just about marketing and 'visual' design, it's about design in it's broadest sense.[deleted]Or they just buy it.[deleted]To be fair, Apple never really innovated. They take an existing idea and 'perfect' it. "
"The iPod was a really awesome mp3 player. Smartphones existed before the iPhone. Tablet computers, portables, regular computers,...If you release something that redefines its category, I think it's pretty reasonable to call it an innovation.Yep, they just pull parts of the shelves, wrap it up in nice packaging and sell their overpriced garbage.This is a type of innovation, but not technological. They innovate in product design and user experience, but not new technologies. They buy technologies and make them accessible.Good point, I hadn't looked at it that way. This, the only thing Apple is even good at doing. "
"I like the macbook air and their phone(even though they're becoming shit, the iphone 6 is such a disappointment to me) because they're beautifully designed and they're not things that I specifically need to be powerful, just to look nice.Well, this, branding, marketing, and advertising. They are REALLY good at positioning their products. The best even.Wait are you implying they didnt come up with a rectangle with rounded corners?[deleted]Apple usually buys a 'Spotify' before it gets to big and calls it innovation.Apple's best bet is to buy Spotify, which dear god, please don't do.They sure have the cash for it though[deleted]> What don't they have cash for?"
"Enough advertising to make me buy an iPhone.>Hell, they can even afford to buy my unconditional love"
"Except Apple is clever enough to make you pay huge margins to love them unconditionally!Shhh...don't give them ideas. Fuck Apple and fuck Beats, especially Beats in Avengers: Age of Ultron and Transformers: Age of Extinction. Their shit is getting annoying as hell.Heh. That was my first thought. Tony Stark couldn't make a better pair of headphones, and wants to risk it all to a pair of shitty Beats?That was Bruce Banner for you.Bruce is not an audiophile, but... classical music on a pair of bass-laden headphones... =PThis only encourages people to go back to piracy. Alternatively I would pay spotify or Google music double what I would pay apple for the same service. f those guys.I mean, Spotify's only $10/month as it is. If they killed off the free service, hardcore cheapskates would pirate, but I think most people can stand to pay 33C/ a day for an incomprehensibly large library. "
"Look how big Netflix is, and they don't even have a free tier. "
"Edit: someone spent $4 on me? Cool!While I partially agree (I'm a Spotify Premium user myself), I feel like a big part of it would be the loss of an existing free service that would damage Spotify."
"Netflix never had a free service initially, and I feel like that makes a big difference here. If Spotify goes full-pay, it would instantly lose 3/4 (if I read the article right) of its userbase, and that'd be damning.Also, PS5/mo for students!Fuck Apple. Good thing Spotify isn't the only free music streaming service.Well we just lost GrooveShark so they start working on the bigger fish like Spotify.I wonder if they had anything to do with Grooveshark going down.No, Grooveshark has been in litigation with the RIAA and labels for years, and was truly illegal in the sense that they were literally hosting and streaming pirated content, and did little to nothing to respond to DMCA requests. If I really have to I'll go back to Google play. Good luck taking that one out Apple.I ditched iTunes for Play a while ago.I love Google Play's subscription service. Good for discovery and great quality. Plus being able to upload my own music and pin music for listening offline is great.I gave Google play a month a couple months a go (as a long time spotify user) and I wasn't impressed. I'm curious why you like it more than spotify, if you don't mind me asking? I have had them both and stuck with play primarily because I could upload all my music to it. Music discovery is better on Spotify, but I have other means anyway."
"The real killer feature of play now though is YouTube music pass. IMO it puts play far ahead of any other streaming service. There is so much fucking content on YouTube, beyond just music. The ability to stream all that and save it for offline listening is unbeatable.Can't wait for the headlines that come out (like every Apple launch) saying how they *revolutionized the (streaming music/messaging/payments/etc) world* like other companies and projects in the space haven't been doing the same thing for years.  Sad thing is people eat this shit up and continue to buy their products.Just like they revolutionized the smart watch :oThey revolutionized the price...in the wrong direction...And NFC payment.I always find it interesting how big artists and powerful labels complain how they are not receiving their fair share when people listen to their music on Spotify either through a premium account or as a free user.  What about the artists that are impossible to find in a music store?  Impossible to find even if one wanted to go buy a 100 CDs every single day?  I have found so much new music since starting to use Spotify, and most of the the new music has less than 5000 plays with the artist only have a few hundred followers.  These are artists I wouldn't even be able to find using illegal methods."
"Surely these non mainstream artists are seeing a benefit of having their music on Spotify.  "
"Imagine a day where artists would directly release their music to Spotify and bypass having a label altogether.  What's a free market without a little anti-competitive leveraging from corporate giants?I doubt it takes any convincing. Look at what happened with Taylor Swift."
"It's clear the labels feel that big-deal record releases should be release windowed like movies are. That means not being on all-you-can eat streaming (like Spotify or Youtube) at release.Now's your chance, Microsoft. Buy Spotify, and tell Apple to suck it.Microsoft Zune Music Streaming.But also, please don't.Long live Spotify!I will not switch streaming providers. I'm a premium Spotify user now, but if it becomes a big exclusive shit storm I will simply go back to pirating music and nobody will get my money, and I don't think I'm alone. I really hope that it doesn't become a big exclusive shitstorm, the only reason that music streaming works is that everything is available in one super convenient package. If they remove that, then (like you said) everybody will just go back to pirating everything.  This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/4/8540935/apple-labels-spotify-streaming) reduced by 70%. (I'm a bot)"
"*****"
"> The Verge has learned that Apple has been pushing major music labels to force streaming services like Spotify to abandon their free tiers, which will dramatically reduce the competition for Apple&#039;s upcoming offering."
"> Apple has been using its considerable power in the music industry to stop the music labels from renewing Spotify&#039;s license to stream music through its free tier."
"> Getting the music labels to kill the freemium tiers from Spotify and others could put Apple in prime position to grab a large swath of new users when it launches its own streaming service, which is widely expected to feature a considerable amount of exclusive content."

Simple as that.Didnt they try and do the same thing with Ebooks?They didn't just try, they succeeded :(Apple has become worse than Microsoft.  OK...Correct me if I'm wrong, but how can they differentiate between the freemium and paid users? Yes, one is funded by ad revenue and the other by subscription fee, but in the end Spotify still pays the same licensing fees for all of the plays. I have never seen anything saying that spotify pays a different licensing for the free, ad revenue, users. So if that is the case, then how could anyone target just that tier of service?Apple sure loves competition. And grooveshark just shut..."
"This seems like an amazing coincidence...You can divide my life into two parts: when I pirated music and when I started paying for Spotify. I'd really hate to go back to my old ways. Apple declined to comment"
"Does Apple EVER comment?Glad the DOJ is looking into this, it seems like Apple usually gets a free pass when they do stuff like this to try to create a monopoly like they did with iTunes. What about iTunes is or was a monopoly? I seem to have missed this.iTunes **still** has a de facto monopoly on digital music sales, sales of individual tracks and albums. About 90% of sales are iTunes (Amazon MP3 is #2 with around 5%). Sales have gone down in recent years (physical CD sales have been steady) to the point where digital sales aren't much better than physical CD sales now. "
"Spotify is a streaming service treated like radio, you don't *own* anything on Spotify, Pandora, etc. "
"I was [referring to this](http://money.cnn.com/2014/12/16/technology/apple-antitrust-trial) Apple is going full fucking retard with this one.Just to provide another perspective on the issue:"
"Free tiers on Spotify and other streaming services are a joke. They pay next to nothing - it's all in micro pennies. Why would labels agree to such a terrible payout? Because Spotify and Youtube give them advances (hundreds of millions of dollars) to make it hard to say no. Once they have the big labels, it's only a matter of time before the little ones follow."
"Artists only make realistic earnings from streaming services when a Paid Subscriber streams the song. And the crazy part is that the Paid Subscriber model is totally sustainable. An independent musician could actually make a living on it."
"Free tiers aren't sustainable for any party, and that's why Netflix has never had one. It's no better than piracy. Taylor Swift pulled her music off Spotify because she only wanted it on the premium service. But Spotify said it's all or nothing, and so she pulled everything."
"I personally pay the $10 for Spotify and think it's totally worth it. I see this move by Apple as trying to help move an unsustainable model to a sustainable one."
"Source: I worked at Sony and did a lot of number crunching analysis on streaming. Now I'm a full-time independent musician. I know both sides.Spotify blows anything Apple has out of the water, and I hope Spotify prevails in this.Apple, I want you to go home tonight, put on some soft music, light a few candles...maybe even lay a blanket out on the floor...then GO FUCK YOURSELF.How is this not totally illegal? Anti trust?"
"You can't use your dominant position in Itunes to force others to bend to your will like that.  "
"I thought the DOJ sued Microsoft over just this crap? If you have to kill someone else's product in order for your product to work, your product sucks.sources say, so lets not assume anything before we get some confirmation, hope you guys didn't forget that fabricated bendgate already.My irrational hatred of Apple is now slightly less irrational. Seriously fuck them.People buying Apple's overpriced gadgets give this company this power. You all earned it.I WILL NEVER USE BEATS. Apple... bunch of cunts. -Sandor CleganeThese companies are so full of greed they don't see that they're creating their own downfall.  "
"I'm not gonna pay for more than one streaming service, and if you chose to not be a part of that, then you won't get any of my money. Simple stuff.  "
"The same goes for movie-streaming devices. I will gladly pay for the one with the best library, and download everything else I want to see.  "
"Want my money? Stop being a greedy fuck. I don't support millionaires who needs a bigger pool or more cars.More reasons to hate Apple. I wish the 12 year olds and hipster retards would wake up and smell the corruption.Evil Apple strikes again. Soon enough, the entire music industry will get itself pigeonholed into their little walled garden and we will be forced to buy Apple products to listen to music. Ridiculous. Yet another reason why I hate Apple as a companyFuck Apple, back to torrenting music again i guess. Way to go Apple.  Keeping things fair since....PSA, if you have Amazon Prime you get a spotify like service for free which has a ton of contentThe content is not up to the level of Spotify's.Yeah everything bundled with Amazon prime is pretty mediocre, instant video has some cool shoes though "
"Edit: I meant shows, but they got cool shoes tooI prefer to buy my cool shoes from normal amazon shopping.> you get a spotify like service for free"
"You mean you get a spotify like service as part of your subscription to Amazon Prime.they don't have the content that spotify has. I find that 70-80% of what I like to listen to either isn't available, or isn't free with the subscription. just like the streaming video service. it's meh at best.There's lots of people who have Amazon Prime and don't even know about this feature, me included until like 2 weeks ago. I don't want to lose something like Spotify. As a consumer, I love that I can look almost any song up that I want to and listen to it for 5 bucks a month. As a musician and someone who make a living off of music, I hate that Spotify treats artists like their music is worthless. What I would rather have happen would be to reform Spotify so that they pay more for these music licenses/royalties. I'd even be willing to pay a few dollars a month more for it too.More reason not to buy digital multimedia.Kill the competition. Gotta recoup the costs of wasting money on Beats...Apple is worse than Microsoft has ever beem. Been saying it for years, but this is quite vindicating.Looks like Apple wants to be broken up. Time for the Anti-Monopoly suites to come out.*Apple offered to pay YouTube's music licensing fee to Universal Music Group if the label stopped allowing its songs on YouTube*"
"I've loved Apple for so long but they have become the very thing they set out to free us from. How is this even legal. Hey Google I will pay you my competitors ad rate if you promise you won't print their ads anymore? Would that go over without legal intervention? Hell no. I know it's not an apples to apples example but it just blows my mind to lose a huge swath of music videos from Youtube when I know I would never be a beats customer. So for me and most others, it's a net loss. Fair commerce now!Apple scumbagsThis is all Trent Reznor's fault. Not a fan of this. This is the wrong way to compete. That's cable tactics.Kind of funny though, Apple is touted as being revolutionary but more often than not they're the second mover a majority of the time I remember a time when all these kind of articles were about Microsoft. I guess absolute power does corrupts absolutely.Well either Spotify keeps a free tier or I go back to pirating it and fuck you Apple.The most powerful bulling the rest for supremacy, nothing new. Especially in the US.I know Apple and the labels wont read this but they should."
"I will absolutely 100% quit paying for Spotify, I will not pay for Beats, and I'll go back to pirating things (super easy, relatively guilt-free!) and the entire music industry can go fuck itself if they want to do this exclusive nonsense. "
"It might take a lot of effort to trickle down to the artists I like on a regular basis, but putting it back out of reach just means I won't bother paying anything anymore.  Period.    I'm not going to cave in to Apple bullying anyone around.  The labels shouldn't either.   It's in their best interest to be on every single service at the same time forever with as much stuff as they possibly can provide at all times.   Apple we can't make service which can compete so we will throw money at the problem and see if it fixes itself.And these would be the same labels that [won't let Apple lower the price of the Beats service](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/26/technology/apple-and-beats-developing-streaming-music-service-to-rival-spotify.html?_r=1) would they."
"I suspect there is more to this story.[deleted]bad move. Apple iTunes is what stopped me from pirating music. I've moved on and am using a more cost effective way to consume with rdio. If they bully that away, I would go back to torrent and direct purchase.  Fuck Apple.I'm not buying your stupid Beats. They suck ass and are too expensive, just like every product you put out now.More reasons for avoiding crap from asswipe dre and appleThe apple streaming service would probably stream in 32Kbps and require beats shitphones This is ~~why~~ one reason I hate Apple.I would rather go buy a CD from a store than use iTunes/Apple.fuck apple. just fuck them.Blatant violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.  What the fuck is the DOJ waiting for?  "
"Edit: To clarify the violation: They are facilitating anti-competitive practices that force the consumers to buy proprietary devices in order to listen to music they once had access to at a much lower cost.  Even without the devices the cost of the music itself goes up as well. So not only is it dangerous to market competition it goes against the best interests of the consumers.I'll never buy any music from Apple as long as I live. If they become the only place to buy music I would cut my ears off just to spite them. Fuck them. Do you remember when you cried when Steve Jobs died? He wouldn't have cried if he were you.Ok, fuck Apple.I'm confused, so Apple will have their ad-supported Apple Radio, paid Apple Radio, paid iTunes Match, and Beats Music?Bring back anti-trust legislation.Time to youtube to mp3 download! I have been using spotify for 4 years now. I built a new computer last month and was stressing out about moving my music from my old MacBook. It was then, that I realized I literally never opened iTunes to listen to music for over about 1000 days."
"I didn't even bother moving all my music over to my new computer.I did this same thing yesterday. Goodbye iTunes, you bloated, illogical piece of shit. You shan't be missed. "
"Secret tip: music.163.com"
"They have everything and you can download it via the player as .mp3. "
"I am not even joking."
"China knows how...This whole investigation has felt really suspect, like the music industry trying to torpedo this service before it comes out. It's the industry that wants spotify and streaming services like it to either die or pay out more and they're still pissed Apple was able to hold them over a barrel after the industry fucked itself with outrageous prices that turned people to piracy. "
"You have artists out there like Taylor Swift and Jay-Z arguing artists aren't making enough off of streaming services and blaming the services rather than the system in the industry designed to funnel more money to middlemen and very little to the artist. "
"Who would benefit from an investigation like this the most? Just follow the money. Tim Cook has taken everything that Jobs built the company to be and turned it into another corporation that tries to stomp out competition instead of innovating. Most of the music I listen to is run by people who would flip off apple, throw a chair in their faces, then run out after shitting on some desks.a) Dick move by Apple, if the rumor is true"
"b) If you like a streaming music service, show your support by paying for it if you are at all able to do so.  _\(also, consider reddit gold, since you're here)_America - Land of the free.> America - Land of the free."
"Typo = America - Land of the fee.Apple really is becoming old MicrosoftApple is always been like old Microsoft.That was my first thought when I saw this.That's fine. I'll just torrent.Because Apple doesn't have enough money yet... Because Apple didn't learn from the last two major antitrust lawsuits. It's the e-book scandal all over again. Greedy much?and I'm just sitting here buying cdsWhen I was your age, [THIS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Records) was what I thought of when you mentioned Apple and music in the same sentence.I really have no comment about iTunes. I have an iphone so I have to use their program to upload stuff. Fine. "
"Coming from android, what I don't like is the segregation of stuff in ios. My primary music purchase place is Amazon or sometimes, I'd just download directly from a site. In any music app on android all music files are displayed and you can pick and choose to make a playlist. For the iphone, I have to create a separate playlist on amazon music, a separate playlist on the ios native app because it won't read any music files but the ones uploaded by itunes. And forget about individual songs downloaded directly from websites.I just recently gave Spotify a chance when the PS4 adopted it as its music service (so that partnership works); I have since signed up for a 2-month Premium trial and couldn't be happier. I essentially have instant access to any song I could want for any mood or occasion, all through my phone."
"I'm in the process of listing and selling my iPod Classic 7th Gen 160gb (PM me if interested, btw) and dropping Sirius XM to make way for a car stereo that supports Bluetooth for wireless Spotify plus Wireless calling (safety first!)"
"Spotify, as a service, is pretty damn sufficient for me. I'm sure, over time, I will find things I don't like about the service, but as a new user, I couldn't be happier. I hope Spotify is able to maintain its model and grow, as I don't want to lose its library and functionality. Soon to be: Apple pushing radio stations to play nothing but NPR, declaring in a statement that The age of free radio is dead, and music is no longer art but a commodity that only the privileged can purchase using new beats audio and apple ipadphonewatchheartsAward for the most obnoxious brands used in a single title goes to.....I have google unlimited music for $10 a month so fuck you apple.Apple is taking away my freedom!!! Why!!??ya I never liked buying itunes back in the day after that i never went back."
"fuck I got a zune later on which at the time had radio over the ipod so it was plus for me and cheaper. still works and been pretty awesome when i use it got music on the zune you can upload it to your computer through the program and have all that music capable of being played on the computer anytime."
"in retrospect wish i got one of the larger zune to hold more music.They tried the same thing with streaming radio and ended up just competing with Pandora and getting no special rates.  I would be surprised if they got any special treatment.Thats a lot of buzz for a rumour starting at the NY Post and the Verge... So far unsubstantiatedwell if they do then i guess our only other choice is piracy and of course youtube I like and use many apple products. "
"But things like this are not ok!"
"I don't identify myself by any of those products and i use them because they work perfect for me. "
"But no company should be able to somehow (try to) change the product line of a different business model. "
"If it's so far and specific companies (like spotify) can't fend(?) themself from apple, apple has a monopol and can nearly do whatever they want."
"This is not good!"
"Until I read this I had never used Spotify,now I love it.Streisand Effect!  This might help Spotify and other Streaming Services to grow even more.You think I made all that money by writing checks? Buy him out, boys.I don't listen to streaming music very much at all but this makes me want to go and buy a Spotify premium account.Ah fuck off Apple, no one cares about your shit.Fuck apple and apple products Apple is turning into a bag of dicks??? They have been for years... Evil knows no boundaries.Spotify Premium has meant that I don't or rarely torrent. The only last album I downloaded was a Tool album because it simply isn't available anywhere else.not in the shop no?Apple and Apple owners really are monsters.The definition of selfish, ignorant, greed.Just remember, this is a rumour. Don't form too strong an opinion with atleast some hard evidence showing proof either way.Apple is a piece of shit company. Another reason I hate AppleFuck Apple.... I got rid of every apple device in the house and have never been happier. you must have a sad life if dumb shit like that makes you happy..Its just like the stunt they pulled with publishers of books."
"Apple needs to compete fairly and quit trying to force others out of business through backroom dealsI guess it's easier to fight competitors rather than offering a better service...I'd be mad, but I never *actually* stopped pirating..."
"Sometimes it's really satisfying to be a scumbag.Apple just really hates having competition. I always did say that apple is just a company full of blind corrupt evil greedy bastardsWell those of us that aren't cheap bastards are already paying PREMIUM spotify memberships anyway, so I think I speak on behalf of us when I say we don't really give a DAMN if you cancel trials or not.Don't they understand that people who listen to music for free aren't going to suddenly start paying you money when you've brought out their free service... Can't wait for Apple to die off.Here we go again Apple thinking they rule the world just because they make a phone that people go bat shit crazy over. Apple could release their own fruit, and the Apple idiots would be queueing up to buy it.Time to go back to pirate bay and vinyl!Thanks for taking away my last reason to pay for music :DApple: *Proprietary is our middle name!*Hey apple, fuck off.Fuck apple directly in Jobs' dead ass. Apple sucksOh hey Apple gave me yet another reason to never support them by buying their shit. I'll add it to the pile.Nah, let's not make a better product let's just try and destroy something people enjoy usingItunes is such a bulky and horrible program.  Everything about it is just a waste. If this happens,  all im going to do is torrent mainstream music.  At least with spotify,  they get something out of me.  "
"Though i think 90% of my music is bought on bandcamp these days.  So much hidden talent.  Thank you for buying on bandcamp. Apple being Apple. Beats and Apple... All marketing zero substance."
"I once bought in the the Apple bullshit, but back then they used the G4 processor and I could believe it was better than anything in a PC. They always showed Photoshop rendering things way faster on the G4. Once they swapped to intel... WTF was the point, I am the biggest Apple hater now... "
"They have not innovated anything in 10 years. Every new revolutionary product is just a copy of something else, but because their consumer base is ignorant to it... It is new to them."
"FUCK APPLEHere is a word cloud of all of the comments in this thread: http://i.imgur.com/3zKqvQ2.png  "
"[^source ^code](http://github.com/Winneon/makeswordclouds) ^| [^contact ^developer](http://reddit.com/user/WinneonSword) ^| [^faq](https://github.com/Winneon/makeswordclouds#faq)I never buy apple products anyway, fuck those guysI hope nobody has forgotten about when Apple bought up Lala, another music streaming service, and essentially shut them down. "
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lala_%28website%29"
"It was my favorite music streaming service. You could buy individual tracks for $0.10 for unlimited streaming. It was completely legal and backed up by record companies. You could of course by the MP3s elsewhere for $1, but streaming is all I ever really wanted so $0.10 per song was amazing."
"Then Apple bought them out, and shut them down just before they were about to release their iPhone app. It all seemed a little anti-competitive to me.Do you want more piracy? Because that's how you get more piracy....Apple wants to get sued again like when they got caught price fixing ebooks? Is Apple really this clueless?  Do they really think they're going to push people off Spotify with something as silly as a Beats relaunch?"
"If the music labels kill off free Spotify, I will cancel my sub and go back to torrenting everything. Do no evil my ass[deleted]But look how responsive the touchscreen is. says every iPhone user ever to distract you from the topic of terrible limitations.Hey fuck you apple, still wont by your hipster products.Man I wish the DOJ and EU would go after these assholes instead of Google. Beats, shitty hardware with an Apple price tag.I'm the biggest Apple Fan boy there is, but fuck off Apple.I'm so sick of corporations that think only they should have the rights to make money off of something they had no hand in creating.It appears the $100,000,000,000 they have saved up isn't sufficient. Greedy bastards. Pour molten gold down their throat if they're so damn hungry for more wealth. when i hear relaunch i think of that burger joint near me thats under new management."
"yeah its still bad.Reason enough to boycott Beats. Refuse to buy and tell 'em why.I sure am glad I pirated my entire 85,000 track library.  I dint have to worry about this shitBack to pirating I guessNo wonder GrooveShark got shut down at the end of April. Now it all makes sense.If the goal is to see a significant increase in pirate downloads, Apple's move is genius. Hello piracy my old friend.Why do companies constantly do this? Can't they recognize when another company has a certain product *figured out* and let it be? Why must all companies want in on the action even when their version of a product is clearly inferior? Spotify has subscription based music streaming on lock, the people like it. Things like Tidal and whatever the hell Apple thinks they're gonna do, are just huge wastes of money and time."
"It would be one thing if they were IMPROVING a product, but they aren't. Some stuff is just awesome as it is. Let it fucking be. I'm not gonna go and start a damn hazelnut buttery spread company cause Nutella pretty much has that shit on lock."
"I get companies want to make money but, fucking hell. This type of practice is just counterproductive and wastes money.Consumers are paying for their very own oppression by supporting Apple in any shape, form, or fashion. They're a greedy company hell bent on taking every last dime you have. **STOP SUPPORTING APPLE**.man fuck apple"
"i pay for spotify "
"fuck you appleBeats are the popular for being overpriced pieces of shit.  This is going to do its image no favors.its 2015, I hope some of you guys figured out that they are bad companies. >Spotify currently has 60 million listeners, but only 15 million of them are paid users.  "
"Only? Most services I know would kill for a 25% conversion rate.If spotify was better I would care. I still have to torrent a lot of music. Apple needs to fuck off, and not touch my Spotify.If Apple just released an affordable attractive service with well done logical features that integrates well into the other services I pay I would switch in a heartbeat.Apple was great for a while, now they are fucking around way too much."
"Their music production apps (Logic X mainly, but there are so many great iPad apps) are the only reasons I still have Apple products. Why would they provide such great avenues for production but hinder the dissemination of the music made with their software?Apple pressuring record labels. Whoever wins, we lose. At least we'll get to gloat for a bit.Another dick move by Apple. They'll do anything to stifle competition."
"I'm not surprised the slightest. It took Apple little no more than 7-8 years for them to expand the iTunes Store in my country so as a Spotify subscriber, I'm potentially losing out on some artists/albums until they introduce their streaming service in the next 7 years or so.Why does Apple try to kill everything I love? :(Fuck you Apple for doing this!There's no way this isn't anti-competitive.Time for the rest of you to stop buying Apple's products.Fuck Apple.Funny how Apple has become the new Microsoft.When will the gatekeepers realize that they are irrelevant? "
"Sound moving through air will be conveniently enjoyed at the lowest possible market price. Thanks to the internet and home recording technology, that price is now virtually zero. "
"Historically, efficiency brought by innovation has always won out over conservative-ism. Humanity has mostly benefited from this process and now will be no different. "
"I love the future, just wish it would hurry up.  "
"Edit: Comma And this boys and girls, is why you should never buy anything from large monopolistic companies known for screwing others over. Like Apple. Big surprise here; I was just thinking how much their iTunes store is losing everyday now that Spotify is the best service on the web."
"Apple is turning into a shit company real fast.  No innovation at all.Apple Watch team puts pressure on clock makers to end the ability to tell time for free.I hate to sound like a Republican but..."
"...there's a fair amount of idealistic naivety here in Reddit.Cool. I already try and avoid giving any money to Apple. Now I can actively go out of my way to avoid it too.Yeah, like that's going to happen lmao.Good luck. They recently just began a partnership with Playstation, which is a part of Sony, the worlds second largest music company.I just hope Spotify continues its Student Discount if this happens.It's always a source says.Some of the comments on that article are... interesting. Quick question, why is it that small musicians need labels?. I can understand that larger artist will benefit from them but what do smaller to midrange artist get from it?.Labels are there for promotion and guidance. If a label believes in your music they with spend thousands if not millions promoting it. But then they own what you produced and have no obligation to pay the artist anymore. The article seems to be totally missing the part where Apple wanted to offer a lower cost tier when the new Beats streaming service starts, but the labels wouldn't let them (unless that proved to be false?)."
"Sounds more like the music labels are the bad guy here, and Apple is just trying to get as many customers as they can by launch, and not turn into Tidal. "
"I'm not necessarily defending Apple or Spotify, but I stopped pirating music because of Spotify, and while I don't mind paying $10 a month, I know a lot of people aren't, and taking away the free options is just going to bring piracy back in full force.Apple kiiilled the raadio starThis kind of thing won't last. Apple should be able to make this a better product. I have both a monthly Spotify subscription and iTunes Match annual. The Beats app is a complete flop. I am hoping they aren't sticking with it.Considering that Grooveshark's farewell message revolved about recommending switching to (here I quote) an affordable, licensed service that compensates artists and other rights holders, I do think that the industry as a whole is aiming towards illegalizing or eliminating free tiers to services.Well at the very least we got some warning this might be coming, didn't hear that Grooveshark was going down until afterwards, had some good playlists I would have liked to get off there...Since Pandora is still awesome, I couldn't care less.man...i have such a profound love/hate relationship with apple.As if I needed another reason never to purchase an Apple device.Hahaha good lucky with that, iphones are a small portion of the worldwide smartphone market I was just looking for the event which recent, brutal and sudden murder of grooveshark would've been the harbinger of.Oh fuck you apple. Now that Grooveshark is no more, this title could read... Apple pushing music labels to make much of their music totally-not-desired, ahead of Beats relaunch."
"As has been said before, a pirated song is (very, very) frequently not a lost sale, but a song that would have been ignored were a cost attached to its acquisition.Back to torrents for me I guessSo wait. If i did understand it correctly it means that i will still keep and be able to play my music if i pay for spotify premium right ? It seems kind of terrible to lose all my playlist's i have made for years.Pfft, YouTube is the best for listening to music.Well Beats sucks anyway.. the headphones and the whatever stuff. And oh gosh the Beats Audio software is shit too."
"It's all shit.. marketing FTW.As someone who recently switched from ios to Android and is in the process of determining which is best for me ( Spotify / Google Play ) , Fuck Apple. I do not miss you.That explains why some artists are dispersing from Spotify. Look at those fuckfac..I mean fine gentlemen I like how they think if all of the free streaming services are done away with, people will just automatically pay Apple for their service.  Think highly of ourselves,  do we?"
"Ever since real to real tapes, people have been getting free music.  Apple isn't going to stop that.  I hope these companies push back against apple. Having had beats for almost a year and then switching back to Spotify I have to say Spotify is WAYYYY better and a hell of a lot easier to navigate and add artists/songs and create offline playlists. NO. FUCK THAT. I like spotify - not just because at $10/mo it's basically free (considering how much I would pay for all of the artists I listen to) but I actually like the UI much MUCH better than the shit apple puts together in iTunes. FUCK beats and the stupid fruit it rode in onI have Amazon prime but I hate it for music.  I buy albums from iTunes that I can't find anywhere else, but i also have spotify premium and Tidal premium (i'm a Reddit anomaly - i like paying for shit).  Tidal is by far my favorite product of the 3, but it gets so much circle jerk hate its pointless.  If Apple creates something compelling that doesn't fuck over artists, I'm ok with that.  And i'll pay for it.Not to take away from the article because this information should definitely be shared but goddammit Dre looks so out of place in that first picture."
"I know he's moved on from the street life but knowing what he's done (from his words and those of his friends/enemies) I think under that half smile of his he's thinking fuck! I have become who I've hated"
"Then again he might just hate taking pictures.Apple is going to lose more money than it gains (from the bribing). If I'm big a label and I just invested 100k in an artist...There's no fucking way I would cut exposure for a shitty service as it is..I wany to downvote this so bad... But that's not how reddit works... Right???I subscribe to Spotify premium and I love it. It has such a nice value proposition and is actually easy to use on my Android. Listen to themed play lists and add it to your personal offline Playlist if you like it. I come from the age of LPs and casette tapes. I basically lost interest in music over the ages of cds and then I tunes. Now I'm finding songs I like again.. I hope Spotify remains...Ok I want namens."
"Who is pushing is. Because apple is not a person.and folks are surprised and dont believe jay-z when he says that apple is using ways to sabotage tidal I use apple products, and this is bull Sh..... I enjoy spotify. Beats was terrible and I don't care if apple backs them its garbage. you're right we'll all find cheaper alternatives regardless Beats will fail. It's almost like paying 4 billions for Dre's awesome music industry connections(tm) was not worth itYou could support spotify and pay for the service, it's only like $10 a month (go online and sign up, not the app), and $5 if you're a college student! You can listen to (commercial free!) and skip as many songs as you want...you have pretty much everything (besides Taylor swift :( ) for that amount! This is what happens when you get people emptying their pockets for whatever igadget they make. The egos at apple grew to this height because of the zombie-like behavior of the public with anything apple.Spotify will reign.Soundcloud?"
"What is the difference between paid streaming services and soundcloud?oh well FUCK YOU apple.Spotify should be pushing Spotify to kill free Spotify while they're losing 100 million dollars a year.100% for sure don't have my dollar now. I knew I still wanted to hate Apple. "
"It's nice that they are giving me a fresh reason.Well that would be the last time i bought any music from itunes then, as if i really ever do anyway. This is great idea! Like removing CD drives form their laptops! Yay!Spotify has been so sucky lately, if apple's service is any good, I will probably jump ship, and I've been using it pretty much since it came to my country.No, fuck offApple hasn't made a dollar off me in 4 years, will this kind of shit never will again. They got a slap on the wrist for the whole book thing, why wouldn't they do this here too? If the government wants companies to stop these practices they should you know, actually punish them for it.I would go out of my way to torrent the music of those artists, even if I don't listen to them, purely out of spite.If they manage to pull this off I will honestly boycott all Apple products for the rest of my life. Spotify is too damn useful motherfuckers.This sounds like one of those RT podcast explain to a caveman sentencesITT: Criminals"
"Wow ya'll a bunch of hypocrites.Email them guys. If nobody tells them now then they can put their hands up in future and say that nobody warned them just how fucking unpopular this was going to make them. Apparently Tim Cook is pretty good at replying to emails from what I hearOh apple, you scamps.shady shady"
"Because they weren't satisfied with one collusion settlement...ironically, if they shut down the free tier, they're just going to push more paid listeners into the hands of spotify. i have one paid account, and two free ones... i would go to three paid accounts if i had to.What good will that do? I'll still stick with Spotify and finally pay up.  Customer service goes a long way Apple.  If anyone wants a backup to Spotify, hype machine is pretty dopeAs someone that just started using Spotify in canada,  it has more or less stopped me from pirating music. If i can't get it through Spotify I'll find it through other means and support the artist in other waysSound like there needs to be an artist boycott list.Just makes me want to support Spotify more. Spotify is in an odd spot for me. Basically the free version is enough for me,  but because I enjoy the free service so much and use it daily,  I sub just to support. On a side note I have to admit I am impressed with Dr. Dre. I listened to his music and enjoyed it but he really made many great entrepreneurial decisions for himself to become a polarizing very wealthy individual after his music career.  "
"[(Dr Dre: hip-hop's first billionaire)](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f10e147c-e694-11e3-b8c7-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3ZE5VAmTq)i dont understand why apple would care so much about this...its not like there is alot of money in this. i pay $36/year for pandora and if that goes away i'd probably not renew it Can the FCC or CFPB regulate the music industry? for me spotify is the only reason I don't pirate. I pay for premium, but I'll never pay for an apple product for as long as I liveiBeat? Oh yeah, kill a free service used by the kids of EVERY US LAWMAKER. That's going to go down well. The article mentions apple wants to kill all free streaming services, so that also includes things like Pandora."
"The moment Pandora and Spotify inform their users of the switch-off, every congressman is going to get an earful about it, likely from personal family members. Pandora is already failing financially so this would just finish them off, the DOJ *should not* let them do this.  Unfortunately *should not* doesn't mean that they *will not*.Well, that's shitty of them, and I love Apple. They should compete on their own merits."
"That being said, I don't get streaming... I'd rather own my music. I supplement my movie and TV purchases with Netflix but a lot of people seem to use Spotify and other streaming services instead of having their own music library.I use both. I have ~80GB of legitimately ripped music on my phone, and Spotify Premium. A lot of my Spotify library is stuff I have on record but not CD, but I also use it to instantly listen to stuff that may randomly pique my interest, to try before I buy, or to explore artists or genres. Most stuff that I like I'll end up buying physical copies of, something that I've done a *lot* more of since subscribing.Same. I used to pirate all of my music, but once I settled on what kind of music I like, I stopped and started to slowly buy albums. Nothing beats perfect-quality FLAC rips.You can never *own* music unless you produce and release it yourself. "
"If you buy a mp3 or a CD you are still only licensing it. It's not your property. I'm pretty sure everyone reading my comment knows what I mean regardless of the semantics. Apple and Tidal are both spreading FUD as spotify doesn't have a *free* service. They have an advertising funded and a subscription funded service. The advertisers are paying for the music. It's free to users. But it's not. Your time listening to advertising has value. Someone paid spotify for your time. I think the pitchfork reaction against Apple is a little uninformed. If you read the article The Verge links to it says major labels want to kill Freemium serves, and Apple agrees. Apple isn't the one leading the charge, but they're not against it."
"Honestly, I'm all for this. I've been paying for Spotify since it was available in the U.S. and it's worth it. Not only that, I at least feel like I'm paying the artists for the music I listen to (I know they make hardly any profit from Spotify) and I'd be willing to pay more if it went to the artists. I have no plans to shift to Beats if this happens, I just think this will force a step in the right direction for music services."
"If Apple is doing this get a competitive edge (haha I'm sure they are), it's shitty, but I can't pretend like I'm not happy that (I hope) this means the artists will receive fairer compensation. We've had access to one of the biggest music libraries for free for years; I think it's more than fair to finally shift to a completely paid platform. "
"I'm tired of this I deserve free stuff because at least I'm not pirating mentality. ITT "
"Rawr!!! **Apple** *rabble rabble rabble* They forgot about 'Dre!These days everybody want to talk, but nothing comes out when they move their lips Google play music, $10 bucks a month and no regrets. Apple can go F itself.You would think they learned from their ebooks fiasco not to pull shit like this. Guess they want to get the $3 billion they flushed down the toilet for Beats somehow."
"Also if Spotify kills free streaming, I'll just go back to torrenting all my music.> I'll just go back to torrenting all my music"
"So if you can't have it for free, you'll steal it. (I'm not arguing against a free music tier, or that Apple should be able to strong arm Spotify out doing a free tier. Instead lets say Spotify just ended it on their own.) Your statement is just a rather shitty way to think. The sentiment you oppose is rampant on reddit. There's no point arguing against it. Everyone thinks that if a company doesn't give them what they want in the exact format they demand, they should have it for free. Hence the paid mods fiasco (OMG why the fuck should I have to pay for work someone else did?!) and now this shit (OMG what if I can't get my music for free anymore, I'll go from giving nothing to artists to giving nothing to artists by just stealing it!). "
"I used to think Reddit was composed mainly of college students, but it's not; it's unemployed or near-broke 20-35 year olds who bitch and complain about the man (whoever it may be that day) oppressing their choices and not giving them something for free. Be it health insurance, music, video games, etc.I don't think the problem (at least with the paid mods) was OMG why the fuck should I have to pay for work someone else did?! and was more We've been enjoying this for free for years without any issue, why is payment suddenly mandatory. Also to be clear before I continue, my point of view is that people should be allowed to charge what ever they want for content they create. The problem comes when they charge more than what the masses deem it worth ($100 for a $10 product), or if they suddenly bump up the price without reason or notice (similar product being x10 more  expensive), then they shouldn't be surprised if people bitch and moan."
"I can't speak for torrenting, but pretty much everyone has pirated something at some point in their lives. Online services pulled them out of it (Steam, Netflix, Spotify, etc...) but if it gets taken away they won't move up to a better service but they will slide back down to something they know, which is piracy for most. I'm not saying piracy isn't wrong, but I also think that piracy in most cases is a service issue and not about people being unwilling to pay. People will gladly pay for a good service, I think Steam and Netflix are good examples. In marketing class I constantly get told good marketing is designing a product that meets peoples' needs, and then you price it accordingly."
"What all of these music labels (and really any content licenseholders) seem not to understand is, what consumers ***need*** is a one-stop shop for their music, or their movies, or TV. I guarantee if there were a single streaming service that had *all music available*, people would not mind paying to properly compensate all those involved. So, in other words, you want to eliminate all competition. That sounds healthy. But they know that. Hence why Apple would happily kill Spotify if it could and crown itself the one-stop shop for all music.Because of this shit, I've just half a mind to give up on music. I haven't paid for an album (not downloaded them either btw) in nearly 10 years. Sorry for the artists, but greedy companies like Apple have ruined it for everyone. I fucking hate Apple with an irrational level of repulsion. Eurgh....Sorry just ventingThat just made me realize that I haven't owned a new song for almost a decade now. The only times I hear new songs now is from the radio or in movies. Does apple just not have enough money?"
"BTW - they are scolding taking money from affluent musicians while always promoting their right to outsource dirt cheap child labor. It's truly sad to see a company that already has so much of the market share pull stuff like this. Spotify was original and groundbreaking enough to gain the userbase that it has and now a giant company wants to take that away from them. There's almost no incentive for startups to create new services anymore. Spotify rose on the backs of artists.  You may as well torrent songs; it's the same as far an artist is concerned.  Apple has always negotiated with the interest of artists at the center.I don't really agree with that. Either way the majority of the money that artists generate is from touring. The labels are the ones that make the money from album sales. This doesn't hurt the artists. They're making plenty as it is. This is all about quality of the product for the consumer. I basically agree with everything you just said, but would like to emphasize that the negotiations are currently surrounding what share of digital sales should go to the artist, what share to the executives, and what share to the provider."
"It seems to me that Apple is trying to persuade music labels to drop rights to 'freemium' services, because they just don't make enough money for the artist."
"It is always a constant battle between content producers and content managers.  In America, the current swing is HUGE SUMS to the CEO!  But the average worker gets piss squat.  And union busting is in fashion again!"
"In this case, it's a small battle Apple is waging to rebrand a new sort of streaming service, but do it a little different, and with an emphasis on the artist.  I think that's the right thing to do, personally.The way you described it sounds great, however let's get a little bit serious here. Apple is a huge company. Them sounding like they want to do this for artists is all marketing. They don't actually care. This is all about their service gaining all the market share that Spotify would lose if they dropped their free services. In no way is this Apple being the good guy, but rather the opposite. It's all about money for THEM. Not th3 artists. Even if that is your view about Apple's attitude towards this...artists will still stand to make more money from this.  So does it matter?"
"And if Apple only cared about their marketshare, why negotiate higher payouts for artists at all?It matters to me as the consumer, because this ends up being (most likely) more money for me, and a hassle switching services, if necessary. "
"And they're doing this to bring people to it, because it makes them look like the good guy, and Spotify the bad. When I say does it matter, what I mean in the context of that statement is does it matter what their reasoning is, if you get the same result.  In other words, if Apple only did it ONLY to make money, or if Apple did it to produce the best streaming service possible for artists, doesn't matter because the result is the same."
"As for does it matter if Apple gets its way?  Of course it does, things will be very different for artists and consumers alike.  Yes, you will have to pay for a service you're using.  Not much, likely $10 a month.  They tried to negotiate $7.99 but that was too low for record labels.  I pay $10/month to NPR and $2/month for iTunes Match, which is essentially ad free iTunes Radio and a cloud service.  I won't mind upping that $2/mo to $10/mo if it means artists get more of the take.  (As an artist myself.)"
"You say they're doing it because it makes them look like the good guy, but I can't think of worse press than this article, I seem to be the only one in this entire thread coming at it from this angle!We're coming from similar angles I think. I also pay for a service. I have Spotify premium, and have for roughly 2 years. I have no issue with giving more to artists, but if the amount that Apple charges for their service is more than I pay currently, I'm just going to go back to torrenting and using my iPod. I'd much rather support the artists I want to support by going to shows and buying their merch as they get a lot larger cut from those things. I wouldn't pay Apple for a service that's already available from a different company. There's no need for them to enter the market at all. EDIT: Meant to say I think we are, too.  And I think largely people would agree if the title of the article wasn't to clickbaity."
"According to this article, your service wouldn't change at all."
"And since the negotiations aren't complete, we don't know exactly what's going to happen.  But in any case, you shouldn't worry about losing your service."
"What Apple is trying to do, is negotiate a higher payout for everyone, by encouraging all streaming services to charge some minimum fee."
"Right now, companies are subsidizing this cost on the backs of artists using ad revenue and selling user data.Fuckin nazisApple doing something shitty?! No way! /sFuck you Apple.  Shit like this is why I refuse to buy your shit.  You compete by force, not offering superior services/products. It's almost as if Apple WANTS the Apple-hating to thrive. I love my iPod and my daughter loves her iPhone, but damn, they make me want to not buy another one sometimes.How about we kill Apple again?When will the herd learn that they are only encouraging Apple by using their overpriced products? When will the herd draw themselves ethical lines and can hold themselves to it?I guess the heard as you condescendingly call them, don't feel they are overpriced. When will you learn that they are good services, you might as well say :)They want to move all the paying costumers to their service and have other customers to get the music for free instead of listening to ads on Apple's competitor networks."
"The result ? Apple gets rich, while the competitors suffer due to increased piracy."
"I'm so glad I left Apple a couple years back. This is 100% anti competitive behaviour Back to pirating I suppose.  YarrrWelp back to pirating. Fuck apple in their stupid asses. I would rather never listen to music than give them one dime.If the title is accurate and not editorialized, it is just another example on why I'll keep buying Microsoft and Google products.Beats headphones are TERRIBLE. ... I don't want any part of their Apple-purchased-Beats shenanigans.Did you hear that? They are ok, actually. A bit pricy. Apple, this shit costs you business.  Get it through your corporate skull! People want less expensive access to music.  Fucking make it happen and you'll keep business.  Fight it and pirates will steal your profit.  It isn't that damn difficult to figure out.I don't see Apple so much as a tech corporation but a giant fire department grade industrial water cannon that sprays shit on everything people have built to make other people happy.Fucking hate Apple. Asshole of a company. The sad part is people keep punishing Microsoft but continue to support these douchebags.Well, some people like their products, dislike Microsoft's and don't care about the companies too much. And vice versa. What makes me sick is that no matter what horrible crap apple pulls, people will still line up in droves to buy any and every new product.  Beats are absolutely terrible for their price. I can buy a $150 pair of Audio Technicas that are MUCH better than even Beats Studios; the only reason they sell is because of their excessive celebrity promotions. Doesn't surprise me though, Apple has always been a moneygrabber.There is also the fashion element. That'd also the primary reason expensive clothes sell. Though they don't seem to speak about the horrible Headphones (my 30-50$ Superluxes are better than Beats..) but about a streaming service, you are right.You compete by being better, not through dirty tactics. When will these companies learn.When it stops working, hah.Doesn't this qualify as some sort of anti trust deal at this point?Hey apple, you already make a 40% margin on products, is that not good enough for you? How about you step away from a realm that you have no business being in.I've just been using YouTube to stream all my music through https://streamus.com, I love it.This all seems like a picture-perfect example of anticompetitive behavior.I like my iPhone. But seriously, fuck Apple.They're going to have to push pretty hard. A record label makes a very significant profit off of spotify streams. Apple's mom.If spotify dies because of this, I'll just jump right back into torrenting. When you have no idea how to make your product better than the competition's, the best way to garner new business and cling to your existing customer base is to eliminate the competition. It's been years since they've been able to make a product that's better than the competition's products. Yes, this is a new area Apple hasn't really been in before, but it looks like they're fairly confident this new product won't be able to stand on its own.This is anti-consumer! I like the owner of Spotify. In the early days when Spotify was getting started, he received purchase offers from *all* the big boys. Apple, Amazon, Google etc. But he said no. He was already a minor millionaire from another company he started so Spotify was his passion project. "
"Aside from monopoly always being bad for the customer (cough AT&T Comcast), I like the idea of supporting a passion project. Opposed to a company filled with old owners who are all solely interested in maximizing profits. That's just upsetting.My iPhone won't load the comments for some reason. hey, remember the antitrust lawsuits against microsoft for doing something similar with IE?"
"yeah no, you cant do this.How is that even remotely similar?The free Spotify is subsidized by advertisements. I think they are more threatened by a competitor. Otherwise, I'm sure they would be after Pandora as well. [YAR HAR FIDDLE DEE DEE.](http://www.viciouspotato.net/)I think they should be pushing to reincarnate Steve Jobs, because Apple has seriously lost their wayDouchebag Apple I just assume Beats' services just being of lower quality and higher costs, like Beats. Apple is the gift that keeps on giving...and by gift I mean reasons why to NEVER buy anything from Apple. I sure hope Google never turns evil like Apple has in my lifetimeSneaker-net.  Convenience is what makes most of these models work. If you remove the convenience and the price becomes an inconvenience, you face something you can never kill, which is the sneaker-net."
"In the old days we'd net message everyone on the college network and have a zip drive (or Jaz if you were that rich fuck) swap party."
"So that's what happened to Grooveshark.I'm honestly surprised more people don't just pirate their music.isnt Apple cooooool now......hahahahhai already dislike apple, but i had an appreciation for their marketing/success. Now i literally fucking hate this company. YOU GUYS REALLY NEED THE MONEY HUH? REALLY STRUGGLING HUH? Sorry but this is a huge problem with not only apple, but company greediness in general.Um, didn't they hire like, one of the most prolific artists on Earth? Plus Jimmy Iovine, whom, if you don't know, is a pretty damn big deal in the music business. And also one of those guys who hires guys to break your legs. Or so I've heard."
"And, um, aren't all artists pretty much **against** the free services because they get less billions? I mean, you gotta have your champagne filled swimming pool, amirite?It's nice to see that Steve Jobs' spirit lives on.This is fucking stupid. . It would just encourage downloading music illegally all over again. I'd rather pay for unlimited music rather than per song. Dude. FUCK. Apple.Apple: The new 90's Microsoft Wait, they're also killing music on Youtube? I'm surprised that Google isn't pushing back on that one The studios arent fond of googleWhen you're a company the size of Apple, you don't need to take risks anymore. You can acquire patents, influence legislation and manipulate the competition to create an environment in which you are likely to succeed. This is their business model moving forward.I'd rather not have to deal with collections of mp3s over various devices again..."
"But I would go back to torrenting so fucking fast.One of the many reasons why people should boycott Apple. I hate everything about the beats brand, from teh stupid headphones to Apple's stupid decision to brand a fucking Pandora clone off of it. Love apple gadgets, but I dont care for the Beats brand and I will never use it.Alright apple fans question time:  how the fuck do you justify ever giving this company which has violently put down riots and is literally trying to put art being a paywall so they can extract even more money from people when apple doesn't **need** more profits. "
"1. Spotify doesn't earn any money for artists. They get <$0.0005 per song play."
"2. Spotify and other streaming services also put art behind a paywall. Instead of paying cash for free spotify, you listen to ads as your method of payment instead. "
"3. How has Apple violently put down riots? What? If this is about some third-world assembly line thing, then you realize that literally every other tech company builds products the same way, right?"
"I pay for Spotify and use it to discover music that I then buy so I don't have to stream it. If you want to pretend to be making a moral argument, then consider again that song plays by non-paying Spotify users make the artist practically nothing (definitely less than plays by paid users, which is still nearly nothing). You could easily argue that putting music behind this paywall (i.e. making people pay for their music and not just leech it for free) will do much more for the artists than the people circlejerking about how they might not have free music for much longer.Arguably free services devalue a product. "
"However Spotify, Pandora, etc have paid and free tiers, the free is usually accompanied by advertisements... yet Spotify and Pandora don't pay artists shit. "
"Also this is a rumor and not a fact. Guys think about it a little bit."
"Music labels and artists already hate the Spotify free service.  They get almost no money from it.  [As Radiohead member Thom Yorke described Spotify](http://www.businessinsider.com/thom-yorke-explains-why-he-hates-spotify-2013-10): "
">[he described] the company as the last desperate fart of a dying corpse..."
"Apple has always been on the side of artists when it comes to products and services, and has always believed that art should be paid for.  There is no free lunch, and if you want music to exist, you HAVE to support it.  "
"I think Apple is trying to move the entire industry in that direction, and I think music labels and artists agree with this idea, which is the only reason Apple has any leverage at all."
"I wouldn't say they're targeting Spotify, (as the article does say services *like* Spotify force streaming services like Spotify to abandon their free tiers), I would say they're targeting any free service that doesn't pay the artists some minimum amount."
"TLDR; Apple is trying to get the major labels to agree to minimum price-per-play across the board, because services like Spotify are bad for emerging artists who can't afford the fractions of a cent per play ($0.006 to $0.0084 per stream).We need a popcorntime equivalent for music. Fuck Apple in general. This won't do anything productive for them it will just increase piracy. It's not just Apple that wants to see an end to Spotify, artists and labels are also starting to complain about the paltry sums they receive from streaming sources.They won't get a penny more from Apple, if anything they'll get less since Apple wants to charge less per month.  "
"They will get a big payment from Apple itself that they won't have to share with the artists however, because it won't be for artist-specific streams.   If Apple gives a label a million bucks, that's a million for the label, not the artists.  Would the label kick back that money to the artists?  Nope!  "
"Everyone but the label gets screwed in an exclusivity deal.  Hi, Apple Fanboy here. Fuck Apple."
"- Sincerely a once proud Apple fan.Apple is a great example of how Capitalism went wrong.If they manage to do this, I'll just jump to the flailing TIDAL lol. You ain't getting a costumer out of me Apple!Well there is a precedence for this sort of shit though. Not sure why but April 30th; Grooveshark went black.If I remember right Grooveshark went dark due to the fact they weren't paying ANY royalties at all.  They got caught and it was either close down or be bankrupt for the rest of their lives due to lawsuits.This makes me wonder if Apple is to blame for grooveshark getting shut downQuote Article - Getting the music labels to kill the freemium tiers from Spotify and others could put Apple in prime position to grab a large swath of new users when it launches its own streaming service, which is widely expected to feature a considerable amount of exclusive content."
"No it won't. The reason is. Apple products cost to damn much. There is a reason folks listen to the Free Spotify, I do not mind the ads as long as the volume leveling is the same as the tunes. Do they really think folks will pony up for a Apple service when Spotify will be cheaper even if they do away with Free Subs? Not only that, but I would not pay Apple on principle. I would go to Spotify or any other supplier because of underhanded business practices. Pandora or even Internet Radio. "
"Apple smoked its lunch on that one."
"I admit,Apple makes some damn sexy hardware, or rather puts current hardware in sexy damn packaging. Then ups the price by 200%. They can keep it, thanks.It's like Apple finds the early evil Microsoft empire to be something to emulate.  I actually think Apple of is far worse in that respect with even worse vendor lock in and corporate control and dipping fingers in every pie.  The hardware is fantastic but software you are forced to use is often shitty and lacking key features other apps provide but Apple says you can't install those apps.  It's kind of ridiculous.  "
"Apple should just buy Spotify really. Apple launching a new service and hindering Spotify with these kind of actions is just going to hurt both of them. Your downvoter disagrees and thinks Apple should use illegal coercion and anti-trust policies to take them over for free.Or perhaps they don't want Apple to get their greasy mits on a good quality service and ruin it.Just fucking buy spotify for ffs. You have billions of dollar in cash. Just wondering how much of this is made up of wild guesses. No official statement from any party involved."
"> Sources also indicated that Apple offered to pay YouTube's music licensing fee to Universal Music Group if the label stopped allowing its songs on YouTube."
"Come on now, they are not even trying anymore.Another reason  to  dislike apple What is the solution.These people need to learn that fighting the new age of music consumption is the worst idea, they need to embrace it and be ahead of the curve. If the big labels had embraced change at the birth of streaming and file sharing they wouldn't have had to spend so much time and effort fighting it, which didn't do anything. Piracy is at an all time high and album sales are at an all time low. It's too late to go back to album sales as the primary revenue. They need to introduce a low cost streaming service like Spotify that handles the split point percentages better than Spotify. Or some other similar platform. I love Spotify, but it honestly doesn't pay out fairly. Labels are going to waste their time fighting tooth and nail against streaming, file sharing, and pirating all the way up until they realize they are in the grave. They need to wisen up and not fight Spotify, but beat Spotify by being better.Spotify compensation is fair. To the label. Artists need to stop ragging on spotify and start ragging on their label to share some of the royalties. "
"Remember artists don't own music. Labels own the music. And where would that money come from? Spotify loses money on the free users. Don't fool yourself, those ads are not remotely close to pay a fair royalty. that's why they are trying to kill spotify free. Arrrr maty! Plot twist: Jay Z convinced Apple to do this so he can make his price reduction announcement: LOW TIDE! Get Tidal! Tidal takeova! XDI see a big circle jerk around Spotify, yet the truth is this:"
"http://thejazzline.com/news/2014/11/spotify-revenue-growth-loss-increase/"
"Spotify has been sustaining losses since its inception and the larger the user base the larger the losses. It's an unsustainable business model. The way content is consumed these days it's largely a loss leader, so they'll end up bought by someone big.while technically correct, the growth part is a stoppable thing.  Spotify could stop growing right now, stop expanding development, offices, and outreach and just start turning a profit within a year based on existing revenue and contracts."
"Since that's not how a pre-IPO company tends to make the most of their IPO or revenue in the future, they'll keep hiring people, keep building out new offices, keep growing.    At some point maybe they'll stop, but it's probably a sustainable business once they lay off the growth development and focus on maintenance and a long-term upgrade cycle on the front end and back end.  "
"Also, that ain't exactly a business focused website, so I don't know that I'd trust them to properly evaluate the profitability of a startup. Apparently [Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-05-21/why-spotify-and-the-streaming-music-industry-cant-make-money) shared some of my views as of last year. "
"It's not just Spotify either: the entire industry of music streaming is similarly unprofitable, and Spotify's competitors like [Deezer, Rhapsody](http://jonmaples.com/2015/03/03/growing-concerns-does-music-subscriber-growth-cripple-profitability/) and [SoundCloud](http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/11/soundcloud-posted-a-29m-loss-in-2013-on-revenues-of-14m/) are getting losses in proportion to their userbase. Either everyone is doing the exact same thing as Spotify or the money is simply not there.Anyone else think with was/jobs this company is a pile of shit? They haven't come out with anything innovative, and things like this pop up time and time again now. The company is heading downhill.I have a feeling they helped kill Grooveshark :(I recently began downloading my entire iTunes Match library to my MacBook, converting everything to MP3 with the intent of putting it on Amazon.  "
"Your Prime account already gets you a streamable AND downloadable for offline playback library of 1,000,000 songs - the same $24.99 / yr that iTunes charges lets you put up to 250,000 songs in the Amazon Prime Music cloud.  Many current artists across all genres have their latest albums in Prime Music for completely free listening and downloading. "
"The Radio Stations of hundreds of playlists that amazon curates had been about as good, in my experience, as iTunes Radio - and again, unlike iTunes, you can download everything to your device for offline playback layer.  "
"The iTunes app is ugly, and it angers me that there is no dark/ night mode. The Amazon Music app is much better looking.  Built in lyrics is nice too. "
"Let me get this straight - apple is beginning to piss people off with pricing and content restriction issues , while Microsoft, of all companies, is giving windows 10 away for free, is publishing free iOS apps that are category killers, is murdering Dropbox by selling the same 1tb subscription level for $30 less per year WHILE including a full office365 subscription at that price - queue the what year is it!? Meme jpg. "
"All this will do is speed up the development of a Popcorn Time- style client but for streaming torrented music. Torrents for beats and tidal exclusives and paid Spotify for offline playlists. Fuck Apple and fuck tidal. I bet they killed grooveshark as well. Fuck 'emGrooveshark just didn't pay for licenses. Irrelevant As a music making guy I don't want to have the average apple user for fan,  apple kills every trace of creativity under the cover of design etc.  Fuck apple,  support GNUMusic labels? Apple? Who are these things you speak of?"
"Oh that is right, I only support independent music artist and I enjoy building my computers without proprietary software."
"Fuck'em both."
"Apple says iPhone 'Error 53' is to protect customers' securityTL;DR - Apple did not clearly state the impact of the iOS9 security improvements to those that had 3rd party repairs."
"I searched error 53 on Apple's site"
"https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT204770"
"Under code 53..."
"*Check for hardware issues"
"Errors: 1, 3, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 20, 21, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 34, 35, 36, 37, 40, 53, 56, 1002, 1004, 1011, 1012, 1014, 1667, or 1669."
"Your device or computer might have a hardware issue that stops the update or restore from completing."
"Check that your security software and settings aren't blocking your device from communicating with the Apple update server."
"Then try to restore your iOS device two more times while connected with a cable, computer, and network you know are good."
"Make sure that your security software and settings are allowing communication between your device and update servers."
"If you still see the error message when you update or restore, contact Apple support."
"If you still see the error message, check for outdated or modified software.*"
"Not particularly insightful in light of current events."
"The point in favor of the customer is there is no easy to find consequence (aside from nullifying the warranty and support from Apple) from having a third party repair the device. I ignored recent posts and articles on the issue just to determine if a user could reasonably determine prior to recent events the consequence of repairing an idevice through a third party. I searched through the iphone user guide, info pdf's, googled error 53, and tried sourcing other channels within Apple's web site, for anything outlining the devices would be disabled if compromised. Didn't find anything readily relevant. "
"To those arguing the value of secured data - I do not doubt your argument. Technically, you're right, and it would be a reasonable course of action to protect your data. It should also be clearly disclosed."
"There is no explicit physical consequence listed in the iPhone manual or related documents for having the device repaired by a third party. A customer would not get the impression the device would be disabled after reading the supplied documents. Consequences to Apple's Warranty and willingness to repair third party repaired devices at the end of warranty are described, not device bricking. The warranty is a year long, contracts can last longer, and a non warranty repair from Apple are pricey. That, and the consequence of updating a third party repaired idevice from iOS 8 to 9 is not obvious either. "
"[Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2016/02/05/iphone-6-killing-error-53-highlights-big-ios-9-problem/#66b61924284a) covered the issue as well. Information posted by Apple regarding the changes to Touch id,"
"[Improved security with two-factor authentication support and a default 6 digit passcode support for Touch ID devices](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1842?locale=en_US), that's it."
"Following the Apple support link relating to the page above (for Touch ID), security information regarding changes to Touch ID. If they clearly stated The device will be completely and permanently disabled if repaired by an unauthorized third party, and will no longer be supported in any way by Apple one can argue against recent complaints. It doesn't. I think at the very least Apple is going to have to backtrack a little bit here and allow people to get their modified phones fixed by  an Apple Store or a premium service provider. I just feel that at some point, enough people will have lost data (pictures) and will sue at a class action level. You don't think Apple has a class action waiver in their purchase agreement?Apple pushes for back up (pretty much prompts you to use iCloud backup, back up to computer is more a choice the user needs to make) so data loss tends to be your own fault.Seriously. Or at the very least have a way to get data back. I have a friend that got an iphone a few weeks ago and like a clumsy moron dropped it. He got it repaired and got this error. Luckily it was like a month after he bought it so he tried to return it for a refund but when he couldn't he was able to get a chargeback. That kicked his brain into the on position so now he's waiting for his new android to ship to him, but this could still be financially a bitch for a lot of people.I don't buy/own any Apple products (just because of preference), but don't they have/enable cloud sync (time machine?) or similar to prevent lost data/pictures?I know that legally they'd have a case, but as someone who works with a lot of important data regularly, I have little sympathy for anyone who doesn't maintain a backup.>I think at the very least Apple is going to have to backtrack a little bit here and allow people to get their modified phones fixed by an Apple Store or a premium service provider. "
"Totally agree, and my guess is that they will in short order. In general their customer service is top notch. They owned up to repairing a hand me down 2007 MBP that was long since out of warranty. It took me a few tries at the Genius Bar to find the tech that had the chops to recognize the issue was caused by a known design flaw. Apple replaced the motherboard free of charge."
">I just feel that at some point, enough people will have lost data (pictures) and will sue at a class action level. "
"Losing data always sucks, but people with iOS devices really don't have much of an excuse for not having everything backed up. Synch with iTunes or iCloud  is seamless and built in.Apple stores will fix the issue even now... They will just charge you.They are Apple. Lol no back tracking just a excuse like you are holding it wrong.I don't think they can backtrack on this. "
"Everyone seems to be forgetting that the fingerprint scanner is used to authorize purchases via ApplePay.  It would be like having 3rd parties repair credit card terminals - will never happen.Apple doesn't even fix the button, they replace the phone. Because fixing the button voids the ability to have a secure fingerprint reader. It nullifies the ability to have apple pay as a secure option and frankly there is nothing wrong there in my opinion."
"The problem isn't the security feature, it's that it was undiscussed and not optional. If this was a known security feature, at the least, was not implemented more or less silently with a very normal upgrade, it wouldn't be a problem. It's a cool feature, if you know about it, and choose it.Maybe not repair, but certainly be forthcoming with a swap or warranty replacement. After all, if the phone is designed to brick as a security measure, it should be considered normal use. As for data loss...anyone who wishes to keep the information on their phone but doesn't keep a backup deserves what they get. I guarantee that plaintiff lawyers all over the country are already laying groundwork to sue over itI'm sure they can afford to give a few thousand people $10 for the suit.why not now.  This is why Apple emphasizes that you back your phone up. When I took my phone to get fixed at a third party retailer, they made no such emphasis. This may only be my experience. I believe the user should have some responsibility in protecting their data. With that said, it is kind of shitty that their devices are rendered useless after an update. Think of the amount of people who have iPhones, you have to realize that at least half of them have zero technical aptitude and may have never backed up their phones, or even created an iCloud account. While it's the users fault they don't have a backup, and the users fault they voided their warranty, they should not reasonably expect to lose access to the stuff on their phone."
"And let's be clear, the only thing most people care about on their phones are their pictures. This isn't a life or death issue here, it is at most an inconvenience. However it's still a dick move by Apple. And the fact that apple stole the use of a functioning phone from them.If anything they will just release a statement in future updates warning against 3rd party hardware use in the UK this is straight up against anti-competition laws. You can't prohibited someone from using a different service in this way.I'm sure Apple would argue that they aren't, the third party service did the repair incorrectly.   "
"The *real* problem here is that Apple hasn't released documentation on how to re-code an existing iPhone to a new touch ID sensor, but currently the way the law is written it is unclear that they *have* to.    "
"From what I've read, the third parties are using real touch ID sensors, and installing them correctly, they just weren't aware until now that the touch ID module had a unique code that needed to be updated.    "
"I'm sure someone will spend some time figuring out how to clone a touch ID sensor and flash the new module, however the new procedure may increase repair costs via third parties (as now the process is more involved).   "
"Ultimately if we really wanted to see change, we should ask for a law that *requires* Apple to release the maintenance manual for their devices (the same one legit technicians utilise). That would resolve this and future incidents which are similar.   "
"I find the whole thing mildly amusing that this may be the only way a touch ID has actually stopped someone gaining access to a phone. Even if was the owner this time Someone said yesterday that releasing the code to third parties would be a security risk - which makes sense. I think what Apple is going to have to do is figure out a way to replace or repair these devices so the security is still protected but people aren't pissed off. Security through obscurity isn't security at all in the first place. The only security risk that can come from revealing code is revealing actual security flaws in that code that already exist regardless of whether or not that code is released.They could already do this by only disabling Touch ID instead of the entire phone.Why can't users still use the phone if they know the passcode?It looks like Apple programmed the phone to say Oh, you installed a part made by someone else? Then I will stop working entirelyI'm pretty sure one of those long contracts you agree to says you void the warranty if someone non Apple-certified opens up the phone.  It may be tough for a suit to work in that case.Terms of Servicea don't trump established lawa in the Eu,  not sure what it's like in the US but the Eu does have consumer protections legislationTheres a difference in Apple not being responsible for the device after a 3rd party repair and, actively killing it and locking out the data.It wouldn't be a warranty lawsuit.  A company creating products that deliberately self-destruct when you use a third-party service or components is extremely anti-competitive."
"If Honda released an OTA update to their cars that cause the engine to self-destruct when a oil change that took place at a non-Honda dealer is detected, do you really think Honda would get away with that? Even with cars out of warranty?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnuson%E2%80%93Moss_Warranty_Act  People are still free to use the phone...  They can install other software if they want.  They broke the warranty...  So they voided their software license. They do if they lobby enough. Well, it is actually illegal in USA for automotive manufacturers to void a warranty for using aftermarket parts (within reason, if you put on a supercharger don't expect to win in court when your engine blows up), so maybe Congress should expand that to computer hardware as well.You got an iPhone, It's from Apple, don't expect it to be open. Apple makes closed systems, you know that.Imagine if Microsoft were the company in this story. We would already be handing out torches and pitchforks.I think Apple might actually prevail in that case.  John Deere has been locking down their tractors for years now preventing farmers from making repairs without taking it to the dealership.  Apple likely saw how successful (and how John Deere was allowed to keep doing it) and decided to do the same thing themselves."
"http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/08/17/432601480/diy-tractor-repair-runs-afoul-of-copyright-lawI don't think it's the same as your example at all. "
"Let's say I have a computer with data I need to protect so I put whole disk encryption on it. Everytime I log in I have to enter a password to decrypt my data (theres more to it, but you get the point). One day I spill coffee on the machine and damage the EEPROM (where the key is likely stored) and not the disk. I take it to a drive repair shop and they tell me the drives fine but the data is encrypted and the public key is no longer accessible. "
"Did the  WDE not do it's job? Error 53 sounds like it's doing exactly what its supposed to do... protect your data. If someone were to steal my phone and replace my touch-id with a modified one, they could potentially access my data...Wait isn't that oil change thing exactly what BMW does with their new cars?No, their engines don't stop working, you just can't change it yourself.It's illegal for manufacturers to void a warranty for using aftermarket parts, within reason. For example, if your engine blows up BMW can't void your warranty because you have aftermarket wheels. Oil is a standardized commodity so as long as you use the specified motor oil then the automaker would be breaking the law if they voided the warranty, much less bricked your car.I think it's a matter of security.  Apple is saying that thieves could replace the TouchID with a fake one and gain access to the phone that way.  So Apple made it so they couldn't do it."
"So a more fair comparison would be if Honda made it so cars wouldn't start with non-Honda keys... which would allow anyone to make a key for any Honda.they can disable only the touch id part, not the whole damn phone.Which is precisely what they do in fact.Can you replace a screen without replacing the touchID sensor?  The screen itself has nothing to do with security.The issue comes when the home button itself needs replacing, not so much the screen. The new button will work fine minus Touch ID, but as soon as you update the device it kills the phone, which is the upsetting portionAh, so I guess it's expecting to see a TouchID sensor and doesn't, hence the error.  I could see a security justification to not make 3rd party touchID sensors work, but a button with no sensor isn't really a security risk.  You just loose some features.  Apple would have to program for this use case, but I guess they never expected or cared for a 6S to suddenly not have a touchID sensor.Yeah we reuse the home button every time in thousands of repairs I've never broken one.  I'm worried that people are going to be afraid to use us now based on a misunderstanding.And that is precisely what apple wants. That's not totally analogous here. The TouchID sensor is a key security component and vital to the security of the phone and it's data. If you replaced the Honda's ECU with a 3rd party computer, they wouldn't honor the warranty when the engine failed."
"But, even then, replacing parts in your car isn't the same. There's no part in a car that, when replaced maliciously, would grant an attacker access to your financial data."
"If remotely bricking a few minivans would help Honda  avoid the potential for being liable for millions in fraudulent transactions, they'd do it in a heartbeat.They have to prove that the new ECU was the source of the engine failing, actually.There's no way they'd get away with that though. Causing your entire product to stop working through a remote update, and saying it's unrepairable because you changed one part seems like a bit much. Imagine if you had to buy a whole new car.That's not a fair analogy though.  If you replaced the Honda's ECU with a 3rd party computer, it voids the warranty.  Sure.  Fine totally fair.  But ..."
"What's happening here is more like replacing the Honda ECU with a third party THAT WORKS PERFECTLY, and then 6 months later, a Honda technician suddenly shows up and deliberately trashes your car with a sledgehammer...Would Honda be killing the engine via some sort of software update? Because I don't think this is the same.  These phones aren't failing, they're functioning just fine, and then they're being bricked intentionally by Apple's software update.>they wouldn't honor the warranty"
"Nor would they be expected to.  However, if they keyed the engine to explode when you switched the ECU with a 3rd party's, they'd be liable regardless of warranty.Well the analog would actually be refusing to start the engine in that situation which is pretty reasonable.Also pretty bullshit.  It means you'd have to only get your car serviced at the dealership, for a substantial markup, and is anticompetitive.  If a car manufacturer made your car inoperable if you didn't get it solely serviced at all times by Honda with Honda specified parts, no one would buy that car because that's some bullshit nigh-monopolistic practice right there.It's really not as it's limited to critical elements."
"We'll be seeing much more of it as car automation continues."
">it's really not as it's limited to critical elements"
"So because it's limited to the things your device/car needs to be a device/car that makes it ok?  Nevermind that when my engine fails, right now, I can order a replacement engine and fit it myself for a quarter the cost of having Toyota do it.  But if I had to install a toyota engine through a toyota tech I'd be *forced* to spend 4 times as much for something I could easily do myself if not for a handful of lines of code."
"Further the it's common argument does not make it right.A car's engine is more like a phone's screen in that it's still a fundamentally dumb device right now. "
"A more fitting analogy would be replacing a bumper or other assembly with a smart sensor such as radar, lidar or camera sensors. In this case it's perfectly reasonable for the car to start if the device on the other end can not be securely verified as the sensor data cannot be trusted to be within operational range otherwise. "
"In the case of the iPhone there's the additional case of information security which prevents regular key based methods to work as doing so would allow attackers to copy the credentials of a compromised device and mirror it elsewhere.  no, the analog would be that you had already changed out the broken ecu for an identically speced unit, and the next time you took your vehicle to the dealership for *anything*, they (without warning) replace your car with a brick.Are the iPhones keyed to explode?"
"Is the data actually lost or is the vast majority backed up to iCloud or third party backends allowing you to recover it once you get a new phone?Data is intact. If you bring your phone with non original home button to an Apple Store they can replace the home button, and run the tool, idk if it's software only, but whatever they need to do, they can do to pair the new home to the device. Then the update will work, resulting in a software update and not a restore."
"However I know first hand that apples first move at almost every repair is a backup / restore of the device. Since backup after the error 53 presents is impossible, I'm not sure that that would be the move. Is that why the article says that the only option is to replace the phone?  Because that's what it said....Article is not 100% correct about everything. "
"You can take your phone to an Apple Store, and have them do do an actual out of warranty repair. The article is completely false about a lot of things. This doesn't permanently brick the phone at all, you should have regular backups on itunes on your home computer if you know anything about anything."
"Apple will install the new touch ID and you can go home and restore from backup. Done and Done.It's lost so far.  No means of recovery.This is false. Replace the third-party part with a genuine one and the phone is back to normal. So Apple is using ransomware? Pay up so we give you your data back? Hahaha, what the fuck.No. They are saying Fuck you, your data is gone and there is nothing we can do about it. You probably want to buy a new phone nowgenuine"
"As though a third party part is somehow wrong...literally the only thing that makes a third party part inappropriate is that Apple programmed the device *you own* not to let you use anything but their far more expensive version of the same part.TouchID is unique here, because it is a component that generates cryptographic hashes.  Crypto is tricky business, and has laws and regulations surrounding it's use.  It's entirely reasonable for them to require their own hardware for the TouchID button, because otherwise it would be theoretically possible to create and spoof a device that could decrypt your phone, which would be bad."
"Where Apple went wrong here, is they did it without warning.  They could have set a date ahead of time to tell people or they could have set the requirements only on the new iPhone being released in less than two months.Not true, even if genuine it won't work, the board has to be reprogrammed to the new ID.False. Your data is encrypted, when the key is gone, the data is still there but you cannot decrypt it so its gone. The mainboard and Touch ID are paired at the factory and nowhere else. Once the pair is broken, the key will not work. And? That's not what was asked. "
">  No means of recovery."
"was the claim. That is false. Replace the part and the phone will operate like normal and you can restore from a backup. TouchID isn't security though. It's merely an easier way to access your phone. "
"Fingerprint authentication is inherently insecure. Fingerprint scanners can be tricked and you leave your fingerprint literally everywhere. > If you replaced the Honda's ECU with a 3rd party computer, they wouldn't honor the warranty when the engine failed."
"But would they remotely de-activate your car for replacing it because it *might* fail?Except if you have a phone with TouchID, you don't have to use TouchID, and if you do use it, it forces you to set up a backup PIN/password. "
"So the correct solution here would have been to disable the fingerprint sensor and force you to use the backup PIN. There's no reason to lock down the entire phone because of this. This is a good point. It does feel wrong for Apple to do this without any warning though. It could be front and centre when you set up your fingerprints. A warning at that point about unauthorised repair would be much fairer.I might not understand the way it functions, but isn't the TouchID only one of several parallel security measures? Wouldn't bricking the ID scanner while allowing PIN login solve this problem completely?The primary security mechanism and key to encryption is still the password, and until very recently iPhones could only rely on that, as fingerprint reading was neither available nor necessary. If it doesn't trust the fingerprint any more, it can always fall back on having you enter your password. There's no reason to lock you out of your data, and even less reason to make the phone unusable, as long as you know your password.On the [Hacker News discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11049020) the assertion was made that on TouchID phones the PIN is stored in the same secure area as the fingerprint info.  Thus, if you can't trust the fingerprint info you couldn't trust the PIN.Right.  This is the difference between the ski resort posting warning signs saying you're going off the intended area, you could get hurt, and might die, etc, vs having a sensor release a pack of rabid wolves to kill you when you go outside the boundaries.It's not only anticompetitive, it's clearly unfit for the intended, and represented, use. There is a very good case for a consumer protection class action here, and since Apple is in CA, CLRA would clearly apply. Absolutely! It's as a transparent excuse as you could find to support this stunning anti-competitve business practice by Apple. There no reason they couldn't have a technician check the device in question and restore it if that were the case. If my bank has a question about recent charges on my credit card, they may block it, but a quick call to verify it hasn't been stolen and they re-activate it. There is literally no reason Apple couldn't do the same. This is unquestionably Apple's way to try and crush small business.sorry, we've been notified that you used your credit card in a store not approved by us, so we burned all of your money - sincerely, your bankI think the simple option would be to disable the sensor instead of disabling the phone. How does it protect your security not to allow you to use your numeric password?"
"Edit: someone pointed out that TouchID is rumored to use a more-or-less generic authentication key between the scanner and device to speed up authentication. If so, it's possible that the sensor cannot be deactivated as suggested.I've seen people argue that then Touch ID wouldn't be any more secure than just using a password. Which means they have missed the point entirely - your fingerprint is used for *ease of access,* not security. "
"Using something for security purposes that you a) cannot ever change and b) leave literally everywhere you go is a laughable idea. A fingerprint must be only a convenience layer on top of a rugged security layer that relies on much stronger methods to keep your data safe.This is why ~~Android~~ AOSP still requires you to enter your password/PIN/pattern upon boot, and intermittently during use, when fingerprint unlock is enabled. Fingerprint unlock is great for ease of use when you're reasonably sure adversaries don't have possession of your device, but it should never be the only thing keeping you safe... And with these devices containing nearly every bit of information about you, or at least the keys to that stuff, it's pretty critical you keep them secure."
"Additionally, I've read (on the internet, so it might be a lie) that the police cannot compel you to divulge a password under the fifth amendment, but they can compel you to use biometric devices. I set up a gesture on Nova Launcher to quickly lock my device in the event somebody (authority figure or criminal alike) demands I hand it over."
"EDIT: I suppose most flavors of Android do NOT do what I just said. Of course, there are only a few that even have fingerprint readers yet. I have a Nexus 6P, so I'm going off my experience with AOSP here. Having the fingerprint reader be your only means of security isn't very secure, I reiterate.Just for your (and others') information: iOS does the same thing. A 6 digit (or 4 digit pre-iOS 9) passcode is required to be configured if you use Touch ID, and it has to be entered after every boot, and at some regular interval, and after 5 consecutive failed Touch ID attempts.In other words: there exists no valid reason why the phone should brick. :)Why not just disable touch id and give users an alternative option to unlock their phone. Cant wait until apple rolls out their car in a few years and you get your tires changed at an unauthorized place and your car wont start up cause of safety/security concerns.If you set up TouchID you have to set up a backup PIN/password anyhow, so there's really no reason that they couldn't have just disabled the fingerprint sensor and forced you to use the backup PIN instead. In ALL cases, there HAS to be a backup password set. You can't only have TouchID. Before this update, this is exactly what happened. If the sensor was replaced, it was no longer valid, and iOS wouldn't recognize fingerprints or allow you to add new ones. Meanwhile, the home button worked just fine."
"So the solution is to roll back this update.Shame you can't roll back IOS versions. It used to be possible with the jailbreak, but it's not been possible at all for about 5 years. how do you dev test on older iOS versions without paying for dozens of iDevices?The Xcode iOS simulator. Given that this is true, does that make their justification a bold-faced lie?"
"**Edit: so bold, much face**No.  Being able to reinstall known good software is one thing.  However, the error 53 is thrown when you update the operating system.  The theory is that you could install something untrusted.> bold-faced"
"bald-faced, not **bold-**facedOr bald facedApple scewing people over no way?! Haha, I was down voted to oblivion in the last post but I don't care,  apple sucks. Nothing more secure than a brick.Well, its true that the best secret keeper is a dead man. Ok Then."
"If you acknowledge it is a security issue, then you can **HELP** your customers by veryfing their identity and get their devices back in working order instead of just **BRICKING IT.**"
"If you keep the device bricked, while its in posession of the actual owner, it's not a security feature: It's a **fault**.This is part of the deep problem of security. There isn't an answer to this problem.Often people forget that data security isn't just confidentiality. It's also integrity and access. If you destroy data you preserve privacy but violate both the principles of integrity and access."
"This is at minimum a denial-of-service and possibly even a data loss scenario. Consider this: I don't want someone reading my diary, but I would prefer that to having my house burn down.That's not the case for everyone though. Maybe my diary has all of my banking information in it and if someone reads it they can transfer all my money to themselves and then proceed to empty out my retirement account and transfer that to themselves. Who knows maybe I live in some broken down shitty house without power and have billions in assets that are tied up online."
"When you're designing for security you don't design for convenience, you design for the edge cases. Sure you personally might lose $500 but if that stops someone else from potentially losing millions then it sucks to be you but they should do it.Your horse threw a shoe and you went to an unauthorized blacksmith so we shot him. For your protection.You shot the blacksmith?!Police heard black and got trigger happy... But he did not shoot the deputy.... "
"Wait...Error 53 is clearly to protect security. The question is whether it's too drastic. The answer is not clear.It is drastic but necessary. It is necessary to make Apple encryption LEO, MIB and NSL proof. If Apple could unlock the device from error 53, It would mean Apple could unlock the phone arbitratily from full security lock down. Something Apple maintains it can't do, since to be able to do so, would be a back door they could be forced to use against their users. Their general approach to security and encryption related repairs is probably to factory wipe the device to completely empty (such as replacing touchID sensor) and then have the customer essentially enroll a completely new device (like they had just thrown the old out and bought a new one) and recover data from ICloud."
"Only way out of 53 error to unlocked files accessible device and filesystem should be valid authorization. Only valid authorization for device after enrolling are PIN and TouchID. Both probably handled by single Secure Element. So essentially compromising TID is also compromising PIN also. Both are just used to unlock one crypto secure elements operational lock. If apple can bypass that lock for example in order to recover data in Error 53 situation, it means they can do it when ever they want. Only way to ensure customer authorizzation for repaits etc. is PIN or TID. If PIN and TID are compromized the device has to nuke itself, since it has no way to verify the person asking for unlock in order to repair is customer and customer should be the only one capable of doing that. If Apple can do it for repair, they can do for a National Security Letter."
"Only way to fix this without local auth  is to rip the old sensor out and factory reset the whole damn device to empty state aka NUKE it and re born it as essentially factory new device with complete data loss. Then you recover the data from backup. If you have no backup, you are SOL."
"Only part where it is little iffy it, that theoretically Apple could allow Nuke it and then re-roll even with third party install. However it comes down to Secure Element trust. Their whole security model depends on that Secure Element not having back door. So in order to trust the phone again, they would have to rip out the third party unverified SE and install new one they trust.Error 53 is to make you pay money to feel happier. The argument that it's for security isn't totally true. Technically it's for security. But let's face it, they've handled other things so elegantly, why would they give you - their customer - such a hard time in this case?"
"Because they want you to know that you're better off paying premium dollars to them instead of going to the repair guy. "
"Or they'll introduce some certified repair guy credential that the repair guy will have to pay a lot of money for and in turn have to charge you more. "
"It's all about the money. Fuck the customer. The security it is there to protect is the security of Apple's income stream."
"Triggering it on an update makes no sense for user security. Bricking the phone makes no sense for user security."
"If the user previously had access to the phone with the third party components, taking access away suddenly on an update is not security. If they were a malicious third party they already had access to all the data and services of the phone.It'd make more sense if the error simply stated something about detecting a non-Apple approved repair or the like and that for security the Fingerprint scanner is now disabled; no bricking necessary. "
"That makes too much sense though. "
"Something's fucky with your finger print reader, you have to use the password you set up for cases when you burn/lose all your fingertips and can't scan them is how it should go.I have a pretty significant problem with the premise that single-factor biometric authentication is appropriate for high-security scenario *anyway*, so the idea that they're bricking phones over a reasonably-secure convenience feature is really out of whack to me."
"If the GUIDs don't match, shut it down as a primary form of authentication. I don't use fingerprints as primary authentication on any device with data that I actually want to secure anyway, so I'd be *ripshit* if I had an iPhone with important data bricked because of a GUID mismatch on a feature I don't use."
"I think there's a lot of justification for the anger here. That they can't re-pair the fingerprint reader to the security suite at the factory is simply inexcusable.Error 53 should just disable access to the phone via the fingerprints sensor. Just like it used to do. Just like the backup security feature of a password used to work in the previous version, the new version should also allow you to use a password to access your phone normally. "
"I wonder if my phone will be bricked even if I have never used the fingerprint access method. It's not clearly for security... It seems more like a bug that their PR people claim is a security feature. Consider the fact that the fingerprint scanner was already being blocked before the update if it was tampered with. The answer is very clear -- it's too drastic. There was Touch ID and Apple Pay on the iPhone 5S, and no error 53. ...How many stories did you hear about people having their bank accounts drained because they swapped out their home buttons? I bet I know the answer.So it's not clearly to serve Apple's interests, which was my first thought? And how it the answer unclear? Apple bricks your phone and destroys your data over a security flaw that has existed for months anyway via a *software* update without any fucking warning, and you're seriously asking if this is too drastic?The answer is only not clear to somebody who knows nothing about security. To everyone who does the answer is very clearly yes.I disagree. Since allowing the phone to function with touch ID disabled would be quite easy and just as secure, it's clear to me this is a thinly veiled attempt to cut out third party repairs.Apples end game: We've decided to lock you all out of your phones because you're a security risk. I do expect Apple to try and do enough to make it right, before this gets to big, but if it were to go to court, I would expect a class action settlement for violating the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act.  Apple will claim that it doesn't apply, because the device is disabled for security reasons, but I doubt that will make it very far in court, when almost every member of the class would be the original owner of the device.I call bs. If it was deliberate they wouldn't have used some random error code. They would explain why the phone won't boot anymore. is it?"
"or is it a way to protect apple service profits?Never attribute to malice that which can adequately be explained by stupidity."
"Sounds like an oversight. From what I'm seeing, Apple did the correct thing from a technical/security standpoint, but that doesn't necessarily align with what is the right thing from a customer service standpoint.With the ridiculous amount they make in phone sales, do you *really* think they'd risk this backlash over the profit-margins of their repair services?  Half the time they just give you a new phone, is that profitable for them?It's overkill for a phone for the majority of people."
"This reminds me of when I lost my battle.net authenticator and had to seriously fax in my driver's license... for a f'n video game. That's when I opted out for all this security on trivial things."
"The phones should have options whether or not to be used this securely, because 99% of people out there don't need to be locked out of their phones to protect some selfies and dirty texts.Spy plane hard drives self destruct if they are shot down over enemy territory. I would consider that an appropriate level of security."
"There were several generations of iPhone prior to this that functioned fine without fingerprint recognition. It would not have been beyond Apple to simply remove this feature if it were potentially compromised."
"It feels like a punitive measure for people going to non-Apple repair services.Given the fact that touch id security can be safeguarded or can be fixed without killing the phone I'd say it is beyond drastic. Upvote for you sir, because you're right. Repairing the Touch ID could be a a way compromise security, and users and developers rely on Touch ID's capability to not be spoofed.I agree with [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/02/05/error-53) on this one. "
">It seems very reasonable to me that iOS should check for a trusted Touch ID sensor. **But, if the sensor can't be trusted, clearly the whole phone should not be bricked -- it should simply disable Touch ID and Apple Pay**. And, obviously, it should inform the user why. Putting up an alert that just says Error 53 is almost comically bad.And the phone waits until the next IOS update before it detects that there's been a change.  So bad guys could only get a few months of fingerprint data.  Good security! /sMaybe Error 53 is to protect security, but the confusing way the error is handled and displayed suggests it's a software fuckup, not a deliberate feature. My guess is Apple didn't think to test what happened to modified phones with the update.Or they are using a particular kind of hardware to replace these touch IDs that Apple didn't test. Lots of things are possible, but it's probably *not* how Apple wanted it handled.From what I understand, These phones work perfectly fine until this update gets put on. It's at that point after the update that the phone locks out with this error."
"The update installer should query the touch pad and refuse to update if there is an issue. Advise the customer that in order to use that update they need to be repaired by a certified retailer."
"If I can think of this solution it must have been raised internally at apple and therefore this action was taken deliberately for some reason."
"Maybe they want to push the 'get your handset repaired by us or face a brick' in the loudest way possible. (news stories)"
"I've repaired thousands of iPhonesThe touch sensor for iPhone 5s, 6, and 6s has always been mated with the logic board. If you fuck up the cable coming from the touch sensor you're going to have a bad time. At best, touchID isn't going to work, worst - you prolly bricked it. This isn't something new. I don't particularly agree with it but there it is....If I accidentally drop my device and the fall damages my home button in some way, I should still be able to carry on updating my device instead of it becoming bricked. Especially when Apple is pushing these updates to my phone constantly, without my knowledge that it could potentially harm the phone."
"Edit: PunctuationI guess in the infinite realm of possibility, sure your home button could come unseated. It would just have to be reseated. It's a case of the home button being serialized to the logic board. "
"(I am in no way defending Apple, I've had android since the beginning)I've had a bunch of people that basically when the phone broke and started falling apart they picked the home button off and threw it away or lost it.  I recall fixing an iPhone 5S screen for a friend. The home button (with fingerprint sensor) was also damaged. However, after replacing the screen & button, Touch ID simply did not work (as we knew would happen), because the button and the motherboard had a mismatch. This is perfectly acceptable. Why they had to go 1 step further with this 'Error 53' nonsense is typical Apple. Hopefully there's enough pushback and bad press that they reverse their feelings on this. However, that's unlikely.Instead of bricking the phone why don't they just require you to enter your pin to reenable Touch ID?Because someone could have installed a modified sensor that steals your prints. They disable it because they can no longer prove it's an authentic sensor. Apple can't prove it's an authentic sensor, so now the phone is bricked.  Thanks Apple, for making that choice for me without even warning that such a choice was possible.>  Thanks Apple, for making that choice for me without even warning that such a choice was possible."
"Wait, isn't this what they've always done? The user should not face the dilemma of choice? :POh no, if a dodgy phone repair shop steals my fingerprint they'll be able to hack my iPhone, that I just dropped into their business, unlocked, so they could make repairs.Never mind the credit card information and countless passwords stored in it. Reddit's it's awesome.  They love that Apple is fighting to encrypt phones, but then when they find out it can inconvenience them they grab the pitchforks.   Because this merits it. No company is 100% good. There will always be some aspects of it that people hate. In this case, everyone loves that Apple is strong for security and loves their iPhone cameras. But, they hate this small aspect of it (which is reasonable). This applies to Google, Microsoft, everyone. No one is 100% good. Even humans. So, to choose a company or ecosystem, you have to weigh each company's good against it's bad.This is possibly the shoddiest implementation of encryption measures I've ever seen.Almost as if reddit was made of different people with different opinions.It's shit design not good security.That's a bit of a strawman. Nobody is upset that Apple is implementing encryption measures, they're upset at the shitty implementation and the lack of user control over how it functions.Really? Yeah, it's for security, sure, once Touch ID is broken you'll not be able to decrypt your data, it's gone forever, so you should at least be able to wipe the phone clean, install a fresh new OS, replace the Touch ID and start using an empty phone afresh."
"It need not be exactly like what I have said, but there are many ways Apple could have implemented this better. People here and comments like this are accepting that they could only implement it in this one way and they had no other choice. A different solution which could achieve the same level of security could have been more expensive for them to implement, the solution where your phone need not be bricked could have costed them more compared to this solution where the phone gets bricked. You're deluded. This isn't about security, it's about corporate policy.It's almost as if Reddit is made up of millions of visitors with differing opinions! It's almost like we can support some of a company's actions and not others. You can support them when they do things right, and criticize them when they do things wrong. "
"Besides, why are you lumping all Reddit users into one category? Certain people can praise them while completely different people can hate on them. Unless you are going through every single users profile and conclude that they quickly change their opinion on something.The thing that scares me more is the popularity of these kinds of comments that fundamentally misunderstand the concept that Reddit isn't one voice.  The people who love it and the people who hate this are possibly two very distinct groups.It's almost like millions of people have different opinions, weird.It's one thing to fight for better encryption. It's another thing to render a person's property useless when perfectly viable alternatives exist.I'm not letting someone outside of Apple work on my phone anyway, so I really don't give a shit. This does not effect me in anyway, and most of the people upset about it don't use Apple products to begin with. http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/44gao9/apple_says_iphone_error_53_is_to_protect_customers_security/czq08f3As an apple user, I'm cool with this. The fact this is the top comment is just Apple hate."
"Encryption is one thing, screwing up phones is another."
"Apple users like the encryption. They want it. They also want their phones to not be bricked over bullshit."
"Apparently you can't have common sense when people hate Apple. Pitchforks? The lack of common sense in your post and how many people agree with you? That's your pitchforks.If touchid is compromised, disable it and default to passcode.  No need to disable the entire device."
"It's really not that complicated folks.Well, most people on reddit don't really have the necessary technical knowledge to understand the underlying security concept of TouchID. So, it's just natural that they start grabbing pitchforks which is easier than reading and understanding complex security concepts.The technical knowledge to understand that several phone companies came out with this revolutionary technology years before Apple and have never had issues? Weird.There's two layers of security behind Touch ID. The first layer is in the software, including the storage of fingerprint data in the secure enclave of the device storage."
"The second is physical, and deals with ensuring the sensor is not skimmed. That is to say, I insert a small device between the sensor and the motherboard which allows me to capture your fingerprints undetected (similar to a device that captures your credit card information from an ATM)."
"As Apple continues to add more power behind Touch ID (it can already be used for Apple Pay purchases, in app purchases, App Store purchases, as well as in authenticating third party apps (such as quick login to your banking apps)) you can bet they're going to make sure this shit is locked down right. "
"Long story short, if you crack your screen, get it fixed anywhere - there's no problem with that. But if you break your Touch ID sensor or an inexperienced screen replacement technician fumbles with the Touch ID connections while replacing a screen, you're SOL until you pay a visit to Apple. I for one do not mind the added security here. I make purchases, sign into my banking apps, and unlock my front door with my fingerprint. Lock. It. Down. They could have easily put a warning before updating the OS saying your phone may be permanently disabled if you ever replaced the touchpad.  Well it isn't that complex. If you have related technical knowledge, could you explain a little?"
"It seems like there's an implicit logical flaw in allowing keypad login on a phone with an unbroken sensor, but not allowing keypad login on a phone with a replaced sensor. Can you fill in the details on why that's not the case here?The phone shouldn't even boot if it was about security. The phone boots and can work fine for months with a new or damaged home button. Only until an update or restore is done does it error 53.Apple knew about Touch ID vulnerability but failed to push security patch. Didn't want to upset unauthorized repair industry.The funny part is, while most people on subreddits like /r/news wouldn't know what they're talking about, they pretend they do. There's plenty of people over there claiming to be professional phone repairmen berating Apple over this, saying it's nothing more than anti-business practices. If you bring this up, they're 100% clueless as to what you're talking about. Almost as if they've never even opened up a phone in their lives or something.There are also plenty of people claiming incorrect things such as the TouchID sensor stores the fingerprint when it does not. All it does is transmits it securely to the processor. It is anti-business practice because changing the sensor does not give you free reign to log in as anyone, you need to reproduce a good hash of a fingerprint. The only security that it could possibly defeat is storing of the hash on another chip other than the processor which means they would need to gain physical access twice."
"EDIT: To people down voting me, maybe you would like to provide a source that counteracts what I say as the apple patent on it, prior technology they bought, and the apple website back me up on this.You can read the HN discussion. "
"The data is cached on the sensor and potentially more importantly, power can be  leached from the bus to attack the SoC elsewhere.I have read the discussion and looked at the entire pathway, they themselves clearly state that the secure enclave is on the a7 chip and not the sensor. [Here](http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/26/how-touch-id-and-secure-enclave-work/) is a good description of exactly what happens, compromising the sensor only allows one to possible exploit the bus which is a very sophisticated attack to disguise in a phone without the users knowledge. How is exploiting the bus or leaching power to do it elsewhere noticeable to the user?! Because you would need to be able to install hardware to leach the power, pack it into the phone, and then have the hardware to attack the SoC elsewhere without the user being able to see it. Seeing as most phones have barely any real estate period, packing such extra hardware without it being obvious is a tall task.There's plenty of room for these attacks."
"You could thin out the inset for the apple logo or  remove some shielding or use the space in the home button to hide additional processing. All the space that is needed to touch other areas of the chips are just very thin wires which will fit just about anywhere."
"Mind you, Apple is concerning itself with corporate and state level adversaries here. If you think that the security trade off is not worthwhile that's your opinion but it doesn't make their decision unreasonable. Where are you going to carve out enough to not only power, but also store an exploit these methods. The button is not hollow enough to store the extra information and still function nor is the apple logo to store the extra processing. You are correct in that the wires will fit but its the other necessary hardware to perform the attack that's not likely. There simply is not enough free room to make these modifications without it being fairly obvious to the user."
"As you state they are worried about corporate or state level attacks which they would look for should these be possible. But as has been stated, its immensely easier to just take a fingerprint than to concoct some nano scale processor and wires they might not tip off the user.Holy shit, you people think James Bond is a documentary.technician here:"
"I agree, reddit has no idea how encryption works.Being a mechanic doesn't make you an engineer. There is some discussion over on /r/mobilerepair about it. We've known about the issue since shortly after the iPhone 6 landed.Or Apple could simply disable Touch ID?Because it's tied physically to the secure zone."
"They probably changed their policy to prevent against more complicated forms of the attacks such as ones that just steal the fingerprint data or try to attack the chip elsewhere by leaching power/data.With ApplePay your iPhone becomes a credit card and as such it should be subject to the same security standards as real credit cards."
"I'm pretty sure the credit card companies required the increased safety standards for their partnership with Apple."
"I therefore think there should not be any way to circumvent this extra security. If the security is compromised, the phone should stop working.The phones are being bricked by an update. Anyone could have stolen anything in the last many months. This just harms owners. You shouldn't be able to browse the internet or make calls with your phone just because your TouchID doesn't work? Apple could just disable the functions which require high security without it affecting everything else. You obviously don't know a lot about how computers/phones work.Because if that were the case, people would still bitch. The inevitable headline would be:"
"Researchers gain full access to iOS and stored credit card data after swapping out TouchID sensor."
"Followed by you saying: Well why wouldn't Apple just disable access completely if the TID were changed? What a shitty company."
"You obviously don't know a lot about how phones work........ Jesus Christ...."
"Im not saying whether or not Apple is making the right choice, only that whatever they do it would be wrong according to the outspoken Reddit base. Why not just disable the NFC payment part of the phone?"
"There's no need to brick the whole fucking thing.This has to be the reason they did it. If not they would've bricked iPhone 5s' as well, but they didn't because those don't have Apple pay. Home buttons are like, $7 on Amazon. Apple probably feared that someone could modify a new button so that it always sent a yes signal to the phone and peoples bank accounts could easily be drained. Maybe they found a way to clone a synced button on top of that, so the only way to prevent fraud is to brick the phone and get people to bring them in to be repaired or replaced. "
"I'm not happy about it, but it might not be as nefarious as people are making it out to be.This is what already happened in the previous version of iOS. Changing the home button would cause touch ID to be disabled.It's not the touchID that's the issue. It's having a nuke protocol that's easily tripped on a device that's celebrated by its userbase for *not* being as fragile as Android. But this shit happens and the, oh apple is just high level tech you wouldn't understand folks are out in droves. This isn't an acceptable issue.Even if there is a technical reason to do so, Apple should have warned users that the phone would stop working. This feature came without any warning.It's almost as if people like one action of a company but dislike another, and act accordingly.  At least you can't accuse them of blindly following the cult of Apple.Fighting for encryption and implimenting it in a shitty way are completely different thing. No reason they need to be mutually exclusive. If it were about security, there are ways apple could have implemented it without bricking the user's phone.  For example, if the invalid cable had been detected, they could have forced you to input your password.  At least that way you could get into your phone.  They should also allow the user to override the error after entering their password so they can continue using the phone as normal."
"Bricking a phone, forcing you to lose any photos and files if they ~~are~~ **aren't** (edit: typing is hard) synched to icloud, that should simply not happen.I like how they launched a broken phone trade in program right after this. That's not what it already does? From the article:"
">If iOS finds a mismatch, the check fails and Touch ID, including for Apple Pay use, is disabled. "
"This left me under the impression that the phone still works fine but you can't use TouchID. Um. That's not how encryption works. What good is encryption if it can just be bypassed?Jesus everyone is up in arms about whether the TouchID 3 years ago could possible be a security flaw now 3 years later people are complaining that the TouchID enclave is too secure. What do you want secure phone or insecure phone with the ability to swap your parts. You can't have both.The phone isn't bricked technically bricked. The phone is encrypted. You have no way of decrypting it now, because you tampered with it. This wouldn't have happen if you took it to a place that knew what they were doing.Well, that's why you back up things on your phone. And it doesn't even have to be to iCloud.  "
"Its not Apple's fault that you fucked up your phone enough that the home button no longer works.  That's like crashing your car and being pissed at GM because the things in your glove compartment got messed up.Except that maybe for security reasons, they want you to know that your phone has been tampered with?Yes, I'm sure you know more than Apples own technicians that designed the phone.Precisely, any other device with finger print ID on it has an option you can toggle for it to wipe itself upon detecting something like this.Maybe access to the secure area on the chip can somehow get access to the passcode making what you suggest insecure. Agreed. In this case, Apple should have taken the TPM/KNOX approach to design. Each iPhone TouchID Sensor and SoC are paired together uniquely as they are currently. Should the TouchID sensor or it's bus be improperly replaced, or become unreachable (common when the front glass is severely damaged, the phone will behave similar to tripping Samsung's KNOX eFuse. The phone will still work, however TouchID will become permanently disabled even if the original sensor is reinstalled, all fingerprint data stored in the SoC will become both unreadable and destroyed, and services which require the TouchID sensor will become unusable. It doesn't leave you stranded with a device that cannot call emergency services, and it doesn't defeat/break iOS 9's encryption scheme. If anything Apple's current design introduces an additional security hole.There should be a way to prove you own the phone and unlock it. Simply typing in a passcode isn't good enough once Touch ID has been compromised. The problem is now that it has been replaced it could be doing all sorts of nasty stuff based on how unscrupulous the unauthorized fixer is. It would no longer be secure, but I do agree they need to find a better solution. They're probably more worried about someone replacing the TouchID sensor with something that can extract the fingerprint data from the enclave, more than the security of the phone. I think it's more to do with faking the authentication and therefore making purchases without the owners consent. That can't be done after a restart anyway, without a password. That's all software though. They're talking about hacking the physical authentication process to okay a payment. If the authentication is compromised then someone could authenticate a purchase online or in a store for any amount. "
"While this is may seem extreme, it really has to be. There is so much sensitive information on an iPhone to even allow unauthorized repairs from a user standpoint doesn't make sense. "
"An authorized service provider would require all data be backed up and the phone be restored/ wiped prior to service, if it isn't, then they usually end up doing it anyways (via restore or reset) for security and privacy purposes. Apple or the service provider are not in charge of preserving your data during a repair. "
"1.10.2 It is your responsibility to backup all existing data, software, and"
"programs, and to erase all existing data before receiving services. -http://images.apple.com/legal/sales-support/terms/repair/generalservice/Service_Terms_English.pdf"
"So why does it make sense from a lack of warranty stance to go to an Apple Authorized Service Provider? My phone is out of warranty already. I just need a cheap repair to get my phone working again. We'll, let's answer this: What makes a repair so cheap? Is it labor? It varies but most phone repairs don't take more than a few minutes to hours depending on the skill level of the repairer. Maybe you know the person? Great. Give them this link: https://www.apple.com/lae/support/programs/aasp/"
"Well the largest contributor is parts. Apple's parts do cost more and although there are substitutes that do the same things as the original but with a different approach to material or manufacturing, Apple's have been tested by Apple to work. Here's what many people don't realize: It is the parts of a phone that have a warranty. When Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider services your phone you either get 90 days or the remainder of your warranty (whichever ends up being more time) to make sure that the repair was done correctly and to ensure you that all parts used will function as designed. "
"Service Warranty. For all service orders, Apple warrants to the extent permitted by"
"law that (1) services performed will conform to their description for ninety (90) days from the date of service -http://images.apple.com/legal/sales-support/terms/repair/generalservice/Service_Terms_English.pdf"
"So you go from no warranty to at least some warranty. Where if you go the unauthorized service provider route, they could be putting anything into your device, you just don't know. It could last for a day to maybe three months, again, you don't know. At least with Apple you are guaranteed parts that work for three months and, in my experience, anything that lasts three months usually makes it the rest of the year. "
"TL:DR You can't shortcut security just to get a cheap repair done. Unauthorized service providers who do not use certified Apple parts could be putting any number of unauthorized parts into your phone to do who knows what. With an Apple Authorized Service Provider, the parts come from Apple and if your phone doesn't have a warranty you get a small 90 warranty to ensure everything is working."
"The screens are mostly original refurbs. Only just very recently did aftermarket iphone 6 lcd panels hit the market. I see plenty of other original apple parts get supplied to us as well, as the components are too difficult to reverse engineer and clone.>You can't shortcut security just to get a cheap repair done.

"And that's a great idea in the first world, but as other articles have pointed out, not every country has AASPs.It's not just about losing photos, your phone is entirely bricked. Some people don't much care about security and are willing to risk taking their phone for repair, knowing that some information could possibly be stolen. That doesn't mean they want their phone to be made into a paperweight. This is a huge disaster for Apple, and it WILL be fixed. This is a PR game for now to hold off angry customers until a fix can be implemented.you do know you can replace a screen and keep the original touch ID sensor and cable, correct? If the technical can handle a heathen well, they can still do this unauthorized, it's just a extra risk. When a user can override encryption you might as well and simply take that feature out of the product. That's not how security works. Disk and file encryption is one of the hardest features to implement without affecting the user because there is no middle ground. You either fully encrypt and remember your damn password or say fuck it and don't. Anything in the middle is a waste of everyone's time. Image that some of those parts had been skimming the key data for all those phones? Can you image the outage at Apple as people said  well I didn't know something was wrong I just got some stupid error message I didn't know what it meant. "
"You all need to relax your Apple hate and learn about security first. On an iPhone you can *always* get around TouchID and type your passcode/password in. If fact if your TouchID failed to authenticate too many times (wet finger, wrong finger, etc) it will just force you to type password."
"This indicates that their security model has always assumed password entry to be a valid way to authenticate (e.g. They can't use TouchID as a 2 factor)."
"If so there should be nothing wrong with disabling just the TouchID sensor. Imagine you are an attacker. If you know the password you are already in the system anyway so turning off just the TouchID loses nothing on the security assumptions. In fact you are just reducing a vector of attack since password is always allowed anyway.It sounds like just a scam to make sure that all parts are always from Apple. The luxury business model.After a software update a charging cable I was using caused an error.  The friggin' charging cable!  I wasn't trying to sync, I was using an apple plug, but it refused to pull electricity to charge because the wire wasn't apple licensed!  That's going too far.That's a shitty cable you're using. They don't stop third party cables and chargers. [deleted]Your just catching on to this now? It was apparent when Apple decided to drop the universal chargers and make their own so customers would have to buy from them and only them.They were using the same proprietary connectors they had since the iPod days, I'm not sure where this universal chargers notion comes from.Anyone could make that connector and have it work if it fit properly and was wired correctly. Now there's an authentication chip in every cable.is that why my cheap ass off brand iphone charger wont work when its plugged into my computer? I'm using a cable I bought from the gas station, working just fine It's almost as if they've been doing this stuff for ages. I remember everyone always getting new ipods because they broke within 2 years mostly. Meanwhile I had a zen that lasted me 5 years. It may still work, I just stopped using it when it became obsolete. "
"Edit: Oh no, I have angered the almighty apple fanboy. so your one good experience with a zen means apple was scamming people with ipods.  ok.A vast majority of tech users don't upgrade their gadgets when they break...they update them when something newer/fancier comes out.  2 years I would wager is a long time to replace an electronic device such as an iPod or phone...it doesn't mean it doesn't work.  I still have an old iPhone 4 that I use for my second phone number. I think we're running on, what, 6 years now? I can't update the software anymore, and it's slow compared to my newer iPhone, but it works great still. You haven't angered the almighty apple fanboy but you said that you remember everyone always getting new ipods because they broke within 2 years MOSTLY. So, you said an absolute, then you said mostly, and it's anecdotal evidence to begin with, which makes it..... total bullshit. Your experience with a zen is also anecdotal. Next time you want to say something like this, back it up with actual evidence. How... How do you even browse reddit with those terms that you just set?Don't question him or apple you fucking simpleton! ^^^/sMy iPod didn't get wireless operating system updates that bricked it though. Over 10 years later, and my iPod still works fine. It's battery is shoddy (only about an hour's worth playing music), but since I can just keep it plugged in, it's fine."
"And you haven't angered fanboys. That iPod is the only apple product I have. But what you're saying is irrelevant to the discussion, that's all.You're not putting shady 3rd party parts that can potentially capture and transmit your fingerprints on that iPod either.Og iPod in my truck still running. Cables break all the time though.Mine eventually broke just because I had used it so much."
"To be clear, the only thing that broke is the headphone port."
"Man . . . if only Apple could redesign that. ;)If it's an oldie classic, you should try fixing it yourself. Not as hard as you think !Just like most things Apple does.Or, it's to make it ACTUALLY secure. Not 'sort of secure' or 'mostly secure' but *actually* secure.Well it's not all parts is it? It's just the home button with touch sensor. No, because if you had read and done research before this, the Apple reps themselves can't even replace a faulty Touch ID sensor. "
"The mainboard and Touch ID are paired at the factory and cannot be done anywhere else. They have to replace both the mainboard and the Touch ID sensor to be able to correctly work. Even then, getting a new phone would likely be cheaper than the repair."
"But, once again like all Reddit hate for Apple misinformed and flat out idiotic statements are the forefront of mass thought.Yes, and how much more do you pay apple to replace that main board, which would not need to be replaced if they had written the firmware differently?  It's a racket.  Oh, people are going to much less expensive third parties to replace their parts at half cost?  Fine, we'll force our customers to only use our authorized replacement parts and our authorized repair facilities so we can keep charging them more money.  Makes a great case for switching to android.Sounds exactly like the Xbox 360: motherboard and DVD daughterboard are paired with the same serial number. The drive can only play DVDs if there is a mismatched. Not bricked per se, but definitely can't function as a game-disc playing console. > No, because if you had read and done research before this, the Apple reps themselves can't even replace a faulty Touch ID sensor. "
"Ok, who said the reps? The company is not a rep, it is the company. So what you're saying is the company that makes its own phone cannot fix it? That's actually not a question, that is what you're saying and the only thing to do is replace.No true, in store repairs at the Apple Store repair and change this numberI cracked the glass on my iphone 6 plus. They repaired it, but they replace the whole screen assembly. So because they designed something at the factory that ultimately breaks their phones for legitimate customers (a poor decision) we're supposed to just shut up about it? "
"Apple fanboys. Sweet mercy.Literally how the fuck is what you said defending apple?  the Apple reps themselves can't even replace a faulty Touch ID sensor. literally means apple engineered their phones in such a way that a **broken button** requires a whole new fucking phone. Of course it should. TouchID isn't just an input device, it's part of the whole security enclave that sits on board that stores your fingerprint, encryption keys, etc. if you can just replace it the entire security measure would be meaningless[deleted]> But, once again like all Reddit hate for Apple misinformed and flat out idiotic statements are the forefront of mass thought."
"I have no horse in this race and just found out about this issue but... How can you insult people so much and talk as if this:"
"> The mainboard and Touch ID are paired at the factory and cannot be done anywhere else. They have to replace both the mainboard and the Touch ID sensor to be able to correctly work. Even then, getting a new phone would likely be cheaper than the repair."
"Was something to be lauded..."
"Why in the hell would you not design a failsafe into the system to avoid *the exact scenario that has just happened?*That still doesn't change the fact that the fingerprint activation could be disabled and it could function as a normal iPhone minus that one small function, that's like setting my car on fire because the remote central locking isn't working when I could still just push the things down.How is that any better? Why would you make an entirely superfluous system arbitrarily integral to the function of the phone other than to force people to just keep buying more? The phones were working fine after repairs until Apple decided to brick them.And they designed it to be that way. How is that a good thing?So if somebody steals it they can't just replace the Touch ID to gain access. Since the fingerprint is tied to the Touch ID and control board you could conceivably put in your own fingerprints. Since the os doesnt know what the fingerprints look like. I hate Apple for creating overpriced machines that aren't built to last long.  Is that misinformed and flat out idiotic?This is incorrect. I worked at an Apple Store as a Genius and all that needs to be done is replace the whole Display and re-pair the touch ID using the tools provided.So Apple is just incompetent.I don't quite get how you think that makes it not a luxury business modelAlthough, you in fact are misinformed. Apple Stores use screen assemblies and replace the button and digitizer all at once whenever a screen is swapped out. I've taken several with replacement home buttons and they give me the same phone back with a working TouchID.The touch sensor is a luxury, it is not required. If the phone senses that the sensor has been tampered with, the correct action to take is to turn off the sensor. Then people can still access their phone using the passcode, like they could with any other pre-sensor iPhone."
"Instead Apple took a swipe at people trying to repair the devices, because they need to keep sales up, and people repairing the devices for cheap is eating into their revenue of selling replacements. They don't want people to be able to repair the phone and use it for years, they want to force you to keep buying new ones.Compare that to the S5 with charging ports that regularly crap out from extended use due to cheap manufacturing coupled with a phone that is only internally repairable by busting out the lcd and digitizer. What should be a 5 dollar repair turns into a ~300 dollar repair."
"Edit: they're all businesses out to make a buck, apple isn't some evil sub species of corporation.The touch sensor is part of a chip/system called the secure enclave - the last line of defense on your phone. Pre-sensor is meaningless; pre-secure-enclave is what matters."
"This is why your fingerprint data is secure from attackers. It literally never leaves the chip - the OS just asks the enclave to check for a known fingerprint. The enclave will only test a few failed fingerprints before it locks down and waits for your password, making it ~impossible for attackers to brute force it. Same goes for your PIN."
"The secure enclave also holds all of the on-boot decryption keys and other extremely sensitive data."
"If the OS/mainboard trusts a compromised enclave it could possibly be used to compromise - or cheaply rebuild - stolen phones. At least that's what I'm guessing - it's in line with how Apple has handled similar problems in the past."
"I'm dramatically oversimplifying here; Apple has a great and detailed doc on the subject: https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf"
"EDIT: slight clarification."
"EDIT: clarified what I meant by secure fingerprint data.>the last line of defense on your phone"
"I like to imagine the secure enclave as a guy in a room full of secret files, pointing a shotgun at a closed door and waiting for a legion of criminals to break in and steal the secrets. All the other defenses may have failed, but no one's gonna get past him. This needs to be higher. The main reason this is the way it is is to make sure a stolen phone can't be used. This thread is full of people too fucking stupid to see what's clearly an anti-NSA type device giving people trouble. "
"Apple went to extreme engineering levels to ensure that they couldn't just swap the home button with one of their hacked ones and generate a fake but valid key to get into your device. "
"This is GOOD and more companies need to start thinking this way. Can imagine the headlines and comments if it was found that you can hack into any iPhone by just replacing the home button?Apple Stores have a special calibration fixture that can pair a new touchID sensor. Otherwise they couldn't do display replacements since Touch ID is built into the display assembly.On the contrary, Apple repair stores have the ability to repair any Apple-made TouchID sensor with any mainboard."
"The problem with third-party touch sensors is that they're third party and Apple, and neither should you, trust any third-party fingerprint readers if your fingerprint gives the device so much access.This is absolutely correct. Source: I work for an AASP.So, if the home button/touch sensor needs replacing, the whole phone is unrepairable?Basically the top part. Display, camera and a few other things.Sounds expensive.Sounds like Apple A simple warning when you set up your fingerprints would be nice.No, they can't.  The only guarantee of security from them would be that they know they installed a signed/certified piece of hardware or running an app certified cryptographically from the App Store. A third party install of hardware/software doesn't guarantee it's safe/secure.  It's part of the Apple experience - you know you're getting a secure and private device that Apple won't compromise.  The second they start letting these modified iPhones out in the world is the second their ecosystem is in trouble.  YOU may know what's in it, but if you sold it you now have a customer who doesn't realize their phone isn't 100% secure."
"TouchID is tied directly to accessing everything in your phone, your account, and your credit card.  Modifying it by a third party completely compromises it.  Even though Apple can say hey we didn't do it, don't blame us - that's now how consumers work.  They see an iPhone, they see Apple. They don't care who refurbished it.  So since it's not officially sanctioned by Apple, it can't guarantee it's safe.  Remember the Snapchat flub a year ago when 1000s of snaps were released?  Well, that had nothing to do with Snapchat, rather a 3rd party app people used to save snaps.  Even though it was quickly found out it wasn't Snapchat that was compromised rather the most popular 3rd party app that wasn't sanctioned by them, it was big blowback on Snapchat.  "
"When it comes to security, it's best you don't cut corners or have any exceptions in anyway if your reputation is on the line.  One security vulnerability can cost billions and bring down your company.  Target lost billions and it's still unknown exactly how much it cost them indirectly in their breach.  The iCloud leak was because of shitty passwords, but Apple still took flack because people thought the iCloud itself was hacked - even though it was quickly fond it was done via social engineering and shitty passwords.  Apple still had to invest millions into more security to protect themselves and make people feel a little safer after that.  They're not about to cut corners and let flawed iPhones repaired without any sort of certification go into their consumers' hands."
"It's about protecting the consumer and their image.I don't particularly like that my phone might brick if I send it in for repairs, but I can see the logical pattern that may bring about such a situation."
"TouchID seems to be a self-contained bit of hardware in the phone, where the prints are stored on a physical level and paired with some software id markers. "
"Someone could very easily switch whichever part is used to 'house' the fingerprint scans and have access to your phone at a later time. Hence all of this talk about re-validating your TouchID when there is a replacement part inserted. Perhaps it might be easy to say, 'just shut off touchID and don't fuck up my entire phone'. But someone must've come to the conclusion that if your phone's already been compromised in such a way, then it would be more secure to brick the phone than to let someone continue accessing it without fingerprint recognition. "
"to the ordinary user it wouldn't matter and might be a nuisance. But think of all the companies that give employees iphones for work purposes. It might be a real problem if someone's phone with sensitive information fell into the wrong hands, and the thief could just keep fucking around with the phone until he/she found a way in. It's the same logic behind the 10 password tries option.But the password is always the backup option.  In fact, when you first start up your phone it is the only option.  This is independent of touchid.  Therefore, they could simply disable touch id, and require you to enter your password to get into your phone without bricking it.  No. When entering the password you are using a backup option to access your decryption key. Touch ID unlocks your KEY file, which is what the password will also do. Your key is then used to authenticate with the key on the Touch ID chip. This is a separate co processor and using the pin still uses it (which is the technologically correct and secure thing to do). During start up like any security system it tests to see if any part of it could be vulnerable. If this dos anything but fully brick the phone it would be a complete security flaw and would probably also eventually be used to break into people's phone by bypassing the functionality. This is how security works. Do you want encryption? Why do you think self encrypted hard drives have been made for so long and are in many people's computers but are only utilized by .5% of them? Encryption is not a joke. It can brick your device, it can delete all your data, but if it didn't it would be so damn useless."
"I will not be surprised when all android devices that use touch authentication are announced to have the same flaw because of they don't enjoy a useless and insecure device.What if I've never enabled touchID on my phone...?That's part of why TouchID requires your passcode after restarting your iPhone as anybody who has ever restarted an iPhone will know. If you open up a phone and install a TouchID sensor which can be cheated, it won't even be usable the first time you turn on the phone after re-assembling it. And this brings up the same question everybody else raises: disabling the TouchID sensor (but not the phone) when it may have been altered makes sense... It makes so much sense that Apple built this into the normal reboot cycle of the phone. Why not not do the same in the situation which is causing this error?I'll explain it again. Touch ID and the passcode perform the same function. You have a key located in the secure coprocessor, this key is itself encrypted with both your passcode and Touch ID data, both unlock it. When this key is unlocked the KEY is used to decrypt your data and validate. This is how full disk encryption works and how it has worked on all other devices that allow full disk encryption. Allowing a 3rd party part into the system allows people to introducing devices that could be used for reverse engineering that system or even worse. It's really simple security and I would bet that any other phone that uses a touch sensor with a security coprocessor will work the same.You have failed to explain the dichotomy, though. The iPhone isn't bricked by replacing part of the TouchID chain of trust and rebooting, it's bricked by replacing that part and then updating to a specific version of the operating system. Realistically, these two actions should have the same outcome. Why don't they?My guess would be that this is to protect against a use case outside of a replaced Touch ID with a spoofed one. Maybe one that we can't consider simply out of ignorance to the full implementation to this feature. Alternatively the error just shuts off TouchID completely, then requires you to change your password.  Then it continues popping up anytime you unlock your phone to let you know that TouchID has been disabled.  Want the convenience of TouchID back?  Go to an Apple store.  Can't get to an Apple store?  Well you'll be annoyed by the error, but the phone is still usable until you get to an Apple store."
"For that matter, could always just make it so the phone uploads anything on it to iCloud then deletes it all until you confirm your identity or something.>just make it so the phone uploads anything on it to iCloud"
"No. At least not anything without consent. I mean, the fappening was great and all, but should Apple be forcing people to use their service which has been breached (and is probably still being breached to this day to get random nudes?)? Right now you have the option to not upload your stuff to the iCloud. A prompt to change that setting as a way to save data in the event of Error 53 would be reasonable though.Fair enough.  I'm mostly looking at options for people to get their data back instead of simply bricking the phone.If you're talking about the celeb nudes that were leaked it was done by brute forcing password attempts and getting security question answers from Facebook/google. They've chosen less stupid questions and forced them to be changed, set a cap on password attempts, and enacted two step verification.It wasn't breached. It was shitty passwords and social engineering.  Apple has since enacted 2-factor authentication and verification of accessing. People still don't use those controls. It's all you can do to prevent stupid people from having their crap stolen.  "
"This is why Apple refuses to cut corners on allowing jailbroken phones or phones that have been repaired by a 3rd party (mainly their security 'lock', Touch ID). People are stupid, and no matter how hard they explain in a way a 1st grader can understand, people won't understand why their iPhone allowed someone in Russia to steal their information and credit cards.  Not saying that'll happen, but it's a known unknown - they're preventing the possibility of a 0-day. Touch ID is built into the hardware tightly.  Software can only guarantee so much.  They can't just turn it off 100% securely.  It may be 99.9% secure, but that 0.1% isn't worth the risk to their brand reputation. Keep the walled garden reputation, and avoid another Fappening reputation.The exploit on Apple's end was that iCloud had no limit on how many password guesses you had which is what allowed the hackers to brute force the affected accounts in the first place. Quite a major security flaw for a service that, by default, automatically sucks up all your personal data when you setup an iPhone.> Reddit's it's awesome"
"Reddit is it is awesome?Yea I read it that way 3 times and gave upIt's not about inconvenience. Apple has user defined backup pin code and/or password to allow users to get into the phone (especially when the phone is restarted). There are other ways of securing the phone. Yes, replacing the touch ID sensor by unauthorized repair shops should void the warranty and disable the touch ID capability, but it should not brick the whole phone when updated."
"Edit: also keep in mind if the passcode is entered wrong a certain number of times, the phone will brick and the user could even set it to wipe the phone. So the security argument is a total moot point.Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tOaWuvTjFg) that explains what error 53 is. It's worded rather aggresively but explains the issue.Amazing how he climbs up the octaves as the video goes on.It's worded aggressively but he's not wrong. I've repaired many iPhones and most people tell me that they're here because apple won't help them at all. Like the guy said in the video, I get screwing over the people that repair Iphones but its absolute bull shit that they're now screwing over the end user. > It's worded rather aggresively"
"A little bit of an understatement.This video is from last October... How long has this been going on? Why is it now all over my front page? I was curious as well so I jumped over to Apple's official forum and found [this thread on the front page](https://discussions.apple.com/message/27166921#27166921) dated Sept. 29 **2014**. At 190k views it's obviously a large problem but yeah I wonder why it only recently got so much attention. Because The Guardian wrote about it due to one of their (editors?) getting hit by it and thus the BBC picked it up too."
"So yeah, basically it hit the media hard in the last week.Exactly. You don't want to mess with a secure system like touch id. Better to brick it."
"Just make sure your hand isn't  photographed:"
"http://www.tomsguide.com/us/iphone-touch-id-hack,news-20066.htmlExecute order 66I posted this in the other thread also.  Error 53 only occurs when your original Touch ID home button is damaged or removed.  No other repairs will result in this error at all, unless you somehow rip the flex cable leading to the home button or leave it disconnected.[Emperor Appletine](http://i.imgur.com/neUK19l.jpg)I see quite a lot of bitching going on."
"I have a simple solution; if you don't like what Apple is doing, don't buy another iPhone."
"If enough of you stop buying their products, sales will drop dramatically, and Apple will either find a better way to handle this issue or say We're doing things this way because fuck you while their profits drop."
"Pro-tip: this little stop buying shit you don't like trick works on any company.They can't. They haven't bought the one that broke yet. They have loan out on it. It's not that it shuts down. That would we a security feature. That the phone bricks and is now useless is the problem. If you could take it to an authorized Apple store and have it reset that might be a good feature. Needing to buy a new phone and to lose everything on your old one is just wrong. "
"Never had an Apple product and never will.that's so broad, one could say that the chain of events leading to Apple making more money leads to better job security for Apple, and thus better security for the customer, because they still have Apple as an option for their device purchase."
"therefore, the more their product breaks and causes the customer to be required to have Apple fix it, the better security for the customer."
"profit logicMy phone is jailbroken. Does this mean I am protected against it? I only update when there's a jailbreak for it (still using 9.0.2). Can you update using a custom built firmware that doesn't contain the check?That's why I protect my security by not buying any more Apple crap.The fingerprint is essentially such a bad method of securing a phone that the phone has to have complicated internal compromises in order to protect the fingerprint data. "
"Even if you don't use the fingerprint reader, you are inconvenienced by its security problems. > The fingerprint is essentially such a bad method of securing a phone"
"It is better than not having any PIN, which is the exact problem it set out to solve. Some people were refusing to set a PIN because they found it too inconvenient to enter the PIN each time. Apple now allows them to use fingerprint instead of nothing, which is an improvement. For people who are anal about security and who already used a complex PIN and were acceptable to that, they are best off continuing as they were. You still need a PIN every time you reboot the phone. "
"Also a fingerprint is something you have, leo can force you to provide it vs something you know, which is protected by the Fifth Amendment. Biometrics can be a username, but should never be a password.what makes it so bad?If someone steals it, you can't change your fingerprint.err...what? i think im missing something obvious here. wouldn't you not want them to be able to change the fingerprint if its stolen?What he (or she) is saying is you can't change your fingerprint password because you can't change your fingerprint. It's the underlying weakness with retina and fingerprint security systems is there is one pattern for you that works. Once that password is stolen or recreated by someone else with ill intent you can't change it to a different one.That's why retinas and fingerprints are for authorization, not authentication.Authorisation is not concerned with discerning identity, that's authentication. Apple TouchID devices use fingerprints to identify the user, ergo they are using fingerprints for authentication."
"Authorisation is merely concerned with the application and enforcement of claims against an identity.Other way around. Authentication is proving who you are. Authorization is determining if you are authorized to perform an action. Authorization is often determined based upon the value of the given resource/action. You may be authorized to perform certain low-risk actions with poor authentication such as single-factor fingerprint or retina but more secure actions will require multiple authentication factors (something you have AND something you know).Not only that. If you damage them enough, you won't be able to access your files.You leave fingerprints all over your phone and everything else, they can easily be turned into a fake fingerprint that you can use to unlock any device.You can also get fingerprints from a picture of your hand. Why does every single post here neglect the fact that the article states that phones that haven't even had the sensor worked on are still being bricked by this error. Doesn't that fact alone almost make it seem that Apple is just making up a bs excuse?While we're on the topic of Apple purposefully sabotaging their phones, there's also something that came with the iPhone 6 called long screw damage. There is a plate that covers the screen / camera / home button cables that is screwed down.  In the previous series (Iphone 5s and lower) you could accidentally mess up where each screw went and it'd be okay.  Well in the 6 and higher they put tiny traces under where these screw into.  They also made 1 screw 0.5mm longer than the others (can't tell without a microscope the different size). If you put the wrong screw in it'll screw down too far and break this trace and make the screen not work until fixed which is a very hard repair.  Apple car owners in the future: I tried to change the wiper blades on my own and now my car won't start. Error 53Garbage.  Disabling the  fingerprint sensor would do that.  They're protecting their walled garden service system.> They're protecting their walled garden service system."

"edit: typoHave you read the original article? You can replace the TouchID sensor, and the phone will continue working with the PIN until it is updated to the latest OS."
"Let's imagine that the TPM is indeed on the TouchID sensor: the user tries the PIN and the private key is nowhere to be found. Obviously that's not the case. "
"Now, let's imagine that the TPM is on the motherboard: the user tries the PIN, the phone is unlocked because the private key still exists, everyone's happy. Then the user updates the iPhone, Apple decide to check the TouchID sensor, kaboom. They could just require a wipe and never allow the TouchID module to be used. But they don't.The passcodes actually aren't at all kept on the TouchID sensor.  Those are kept on the TPM, which is a seperate chip soldered to the motherboard, not a replaceable part.  Maybe you should educate yourself.  In fact, it's the TPM that's saying I don't trust the TouchID sensor.  Better shut everything else down too.  Which is blatantly anti-consumer.Oh hey I took intro to IT too. What does a sensor have to with private keys?https://www.quora.com/What-is-Apple%E2%80%99s-new-Secure-Enclave-and-why-is-it-importantWhy does the phone boot then?

I have no problems with Error 53 if it wasn't retroactive and you could disable it in settings.It's not 2FA though, you can use the TouchID ***or*** a password to unlock the device. "

"I read through both your links"
">Security Enclave / TrustZone"
"It's an encryption method and protocol for where things get run, basically a sandbox mode like most modern antiviruses have but run natively on the hardware and applied to all processes that the device runs. Data authentication through internet connections (both wifi and cellular) utilize auth tokens. "
"The only thing it says about TouchID in depth is that a password is created as a backup. This link says nothing useful about how TouchID interacts with the hardware on the phone such that disabling or removing TouchID would prevent access to the phone entirely and doesn't seem to support your view at all."
">TPM"
"This is the actual hardware module that performs the encrypt/decrypt functions at a hardware level (which is more secure and faster than doing it at the kernel or software level). Many manufacturers have these chips installed, and it doesn't appear this exact problem occurs with anyone except Apple."
"Okay, so why is this only a problem for Apple?"
"More importantly, if Apple integrated a TPM into the TouchID hardware in some way, why doesn't this invalidate the user accessing the device until they do a factory reset or update the device? Why can you only use the password to unlock the device under certain circumstances (reboot, 48 hours without unlock, full battery drain)?"
"From all the information out about how TouchID work it appears that users getting bricked for using 3rd party repairs isn't intentional, especially since Apple didn't release a warning about 3rd party repairs potentially bricking the device (which they don't really have a legal right to do anyway, they can only revoke the OS license since the device itself is owned by the end user). That would put Apple at fault for all the data lost and the phones that were rendered useless because of it.Allowing 3rd parties to modify a device into a usable state is a security risk."
"No defense/security contracts will sign on to Apple if they do that. Yes, They needs those pennies. Their repair department is their bloodline, they need to protect it ! "
"/sYou mean it could fallback to always asking for the pin/password to unlock?You use the product the way Apple chooses, or you don't buy it. This has been true for a very long time now.I'm pretty sure that error protects Apple's profit margin too.I would not be so sure about that. If you brick $500 and Apple says fuck-you, that might have been the last Apple device you bought. Ever."

"So many people don't even *know* there are other smartphones out there besides maybe the Galaxy.  "
"If there is one thing Apple does better than create solid hardware, it's marketing.You ***seriously*** over-estimate apple users. The dude who wrote one of the first articles literally just said that he *instantly* bought another iPhone to replace his bricked one. cool thing about apple is they have an army of drones that grows daily, who dont care."
"dont forget to buy your new iphone 6s and then 7, 7s, and 7 gs!Thats part of what I meant: If you do that to a customer, it does not matter how loyal the customer was. Yeah... right Considering who most of Apple's userbase is, that will not be the case...Just about every Apple fan I know has had a horrible experience with one of their products and went out and bought the new one to escape from it.Guess they have a working business model thenIt's basically brand identity, but unironically yeah. I don't think Apple fans are idiots or anything, but when you cater to a group of relative technology neophytes with the promise that they're buying an item that's hip and not overcomplicated like they perceive other tech to be, they're more invested in continuing with your products than Android users, who might go back and forth between manufacturers based on their experience.I think the argument usually is I don't want to switch to Android, because I'll have to relearn everything. and I agree with that, I guess. People like our parents don't have the interest to figure out the inner workings of their devices.Holy shit. This is the most accurate way to describe apples success that I've seenThen for the rest of time, your texts are screwed because of ImessageIf you message stuff that needs archiving, iMessage is the wrong tool anyway... don't you think?"
"I use SMS on my personal Android (and backup those to my gmail account), and email on my company-provided iPhone....What? That had nothing to do with Apple's Imessage issues."
"Edit: I see what you're referring to now, never mind. Pretty sure that issue was fixed. Yeah well, obviously the data has to be decrypted before you make search queries. iMessage might be bad for archiving texts but I fail to see how the cause is encryption. Are you some kind of weird troll? I'm talking about the issues with apple phones not being able to text people who have switched away from Apple because of Apple's Imessage system.What, like how you can't send Skype messages to people without Skype, or WhatsApp messages to people without WhatsApp. I don't see how not being able to send iMessages to people without iPhones is at all wrong."
"Anyway, you can do that, it's just called *texting*. I edited after I realized what you were vaguely referring to. Pretty sure that's not really an issue anymore. Obviously if you leave your phone number set up to be intercepted and other iPhones don't update your contact to always send as text message, your texts will be intercepted. Why do people insist on making shit up? There's plenty to criticise Apple for without having to lie."
"iMessage [can be very easily turned off even if you no longer physically have the phone](https://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage).That implies sacrificing not just the phone, but all the money the user has put into iTunes and the app store along with it.migrated out my entire itunes collection, and to be honest like 20 or so quid over the course of 3 and a bit years is not really a sacrifice to lose. "
"So happy to be shot of that iphone.I have a 6s plus with 128 GB of storage.  If they bricked it, it would be a $949 fuck you.  I find it hard to find an Android phone above $649, even  looking at comparable hardware.  Looks like I'd have a spare $300 to replace apps etc.  Our music collection has largely been built from Amazon (MP3s) so...  why do we still have Apple phones? "
"Oh yeah, they're pretty. And they haven't screwed us... yet.Wait, bricking one phone and being forced to buy another is *saving* you money?Well, no, because it's still $649 more than they would have spent otherwise Super easy instructions exist to give you step by step hand holding on porting your shit over to another platform. If your apps can be tied to your FB or some other social platform, you can sometimes keep your scores and stats, but everything else from itunes to icloud and contacts/txts can be saved.>thumbprint"
"A print is a username, not a password.So, what the people who are defending this are saying, is that TouchID has had a massive security flaw this whole time and that (up until now) it's been easy for a third party to change the home button and access all of the private information supposedly protected by TouchID."
"And Apple told no-one? Why isn't this a huge scandal?I want to make a comparison to another device where this was an issue with not long ago. I just made this comparison in another thread but it needs to be made here as well. "
"Also I am not defending Apple nor Google, simply just stating a case and the facts here and why Apples defense actually make sense. "
"The case was back when Google Wallet and NFC was new on Android devices there was a similar security measure which was implemented that causes Apples Error 53. In the case of Google Wallet, there was a sector of RAM on the NFC module which stored a key of sorts which was tied to your Android ID (a hash unique to each installation of Android). "
"Now this is not a problem with OTA updates or anything as the Android ID is carried over through updates. However in order to protect your Wallet data should anyone ever copy your Android system files, they would not be able to access your Wallet because they need the key attached to the NFC module. "
"Now here's the problem. If you are like many and root your Android device. Then install a new version of Android. You have now changed your Android ID. However the security key for your old Wallet is still stored in the NFC. The NFC driver would recognize the mismatch and would fail to start resulting in any app which uses secure NFC crashing. This issue bricks the NFC chip. Once the mismatch occures you cannot fix it without replacement of the device or the ability to recover your old Android ID through a Nandroid backup (system image basically). "
"I ran into this issue after flashing a Galaxy Note 2 back to stock after having issues with a Nexus ROM. I didn't clear my Google Wallet and therefore all apps which used secure NFC stopped functioning. "
"Apple has attempted the same level of hardware security here. Where a string is attached to your touch ID sensor. This string is paired with the device. This way the data on the phone is hardware protected and a malicious touch ID sensor cannot be used to bypass the OS security.A Secure Element compromise would just brick the NFC module of the Android device. Anything that doesn't require NFC would function properly."
"Error 53 renders an iPhone completely useless.But that is actually reasonable coming from Google, ya know? It bricks one component of the phone, that honestly isn't even used that much. However, with Apple, it renders your whole device useless and wipes EVERYTHING ever held on it, with no chance of recovery. I think there is quite a difference here...Remember that picture you took of your mom a few days ago? You know, when you saw her for the first time in years and days before she passed? I hope so, because there it goes."
"ie: buy our proprietary button or dont use your phone at allYes. Let's collect this sweet button dollars!!!This should be the link title. I wonder when people will start realizing Apple could just brick the authentication function instead of ruining the device.At some point you have to say thanks for the heads up, I acknowledge the risks associated with this, and carry on using your phone. "
"A simple device modified by third parties on the startup screen would also keep customers security! Disabling the phone permanently is not okay. "
"Just like some android devices allow you to unlock your boot loader, after signing off on a disclaimer and disclosure that this may damage your device and weaken security, you can proceed if you're willing to take that chance, and give up manufacturer support. "
"After all, you own the physical device, the software that the manufacturer includes may not be yours. You ought to be free to put your own on there, on your own risk of course. "
"Or, how about you give me the device free of charge, on your terms and conditions, and I don't pay for the hardware, and you can disable the device whenever you want? That would also be agreeable. "
"Reason # bajillion to jailbreak. This is really a double-edged sword. We understand Apple is trying their best to protect their users from being spied by government-backed agencies (because they will always have ideas to bypass or modify the fingerprint sensor home button). But straight up bricking it isn't the best way to solve the issue, instead it'll just make us to think you're just another greedy company that charge us ridiculous amount of repair fee and dealing with those geniuses. How about just disabling all touch-ID-related functions instead??You really think a government would be looking to exploit hardware directly for spying purposes? Nah, they'd just use a software exploit, and there is a thriving market for 0day vulnerabilities that governments buy from on the regular. Or they could attack the cell tower/communication infrastructure the iPhone is using, or any number of other attack vectors that aren't as difficult or intrusive as a physical attack."
"This is just Apple trying to save face after a design fuckup, they aren't actually concerned someone is going to pull off state of the art hardware-based attacks on individual consumer phones. What happens if you replace the TPM on Android devices that have Android Pay?It's not a bug, it's a feature...this is why i got a nice htc one m9If they are going to insist on digging that hole any deeper, they are going to need a backhoe.I'm about to attempt to fix a friend's iPhone 5S. It's just a screen replacement. Do I need to be worried about this Error 53 yet, or has it not fully rolled out yet? Or is it just for home button replacements? the screen and the home button is one in the view of this issueI hit you because I love you. It's for your own good, baby.Then have a message that says this iPhone detected a hardware change, enter your password to continueApple: You'll shoot your eye out, kid.Again: if it *really* were about safety then just disable the functions that rely on Touch ID (which was already being done). Or, another acceptable alternative: wipe the device THEN operate as if it was an iDevice without Touch ID in the first place. Though the latter might suck for some, you still have a functioning device instead of a paperweight at the end of the day.Personally after all this stuff, I will be very unlikely to invest in an Apple product in future. I'd like to get a new touch to replace the one I have (which is broken, docking port issue even after having it repaired by a certified technician), to get the data off it, but by and large there are now just too many issues to having an i-device and I'm not too ashamed to admit that I simply can't afford all these problems that occur every time the software is updated, etc. And there's too much at stake when you've got all your data on there and paid for tons of apps."
"TL;DR ordinary people can't afford all thisCan someone explain to me why touch ID gets disabled after a reboot on *everything*? Like I sort of understand why it has to be disabled for the first login. But why, after I've already entered my password, does it have to be disabled for itunes, etc.?Yes no shit. You guys are idiots if you think apple is the one who fucked up hereIs it weird that I'm still totally cool with my iPhone 4?I'm not sure I understand this. If the phone is capable of verifying the integrity of all of its internal components for the purpose of ensuring the device is secure, why is it designed to boot up and run unhindered without doing an integrity check for so long (until the next update)?"
"Yeah I feel secure now with my bricked iPhone 6."
"If the hardware was swapped then it should disable all Touch ID features rather than brick the phone. "
"I have a PS500 paperweight This just doesn't make any sense to me, in order to replace the fingerprint scanner you would need a large amount of time with the phone, this isn't something you can just steal the phone away for a bit, put it back, and then have the scans uploaded somewhere."
"To me this seems like an attempt to capitalize on an excuse, brick the phone resulting in people being unable to fix them when they break (planned obsolescence) and doing it under the guise of security. "
"Only scenario I can think of is if someone stole it, but how would putting in a fake scanner work if you don't have the original print? The phone is going to compare the readout from your finger to what it has locally, I doubt you can program something and just say let me in that is horrible security."
"The whole bricking as a result of an update is just an unintended error I think. I can't imagine this being a beneficial move overall by bricking it, it's best to require a fallback pin and email authorization secondary authorization when the fingerprint scan fails. Can someone help me with a question I have? "
"I got my Iphone 6 unlocked from one company to completely unlocked and was wondering if this update will brick my phone? I just wanted to make sure before updating despite not changing my home screen button. "
"Thanks in advanceThis issue ONLY affects iPhones that have had the home button (touch ID) sensor replaced, or the entire front (including that button) replaced.Haha apple sucks The posts here remind me of a very long argument I got into years ago over Apple charging for firmware updates for the iPod touch (using some accounting BS as the excuse). I argued against it but was stormed by blind Apple fanboys arguing it was justified. It is insane how far a fanboy will go to excuse blatant missteps (and even abuse) by the brands they worship."
"There is absolutely no reason that these phones should have to be bricked. Simply disabling Touch ID is all that should have happened to a modified phone.[There was a legit reason for the iPod upgrade charge](http://www.macworld.com/article/1131991/ipodtouch.html).  "
"And congratulations with being so familiar with all of the iPhone's security implementation in order to logically conclude that There is absolutely no reason that these phones should have to be bricked. It's obvious that Apple want's the sweet nectar of the huge home button repair market.Nobody, and I mean NOBODY, charges for such updates to these kind of consumer devices. Apple even backed off of it when a stink was raised. If it just HAD to be done, explain to me how no one else had to follow that rule."
"Also, they were supposedly free to set the amount of the charge. If their arm were truly twisted on the matter, why not charge a buck or less, instead of $20?Nobody else updates these consumer devices. All I'm saying is, before you grab the pitchfork, and assume that Apple, like all capitalist pigs, enjoy finding nefarious ways to drink your blood, think if there is another reason why a company, with arguably the best customer support and satisfaction, does something that inconveniences its users...Are you living in an Apple bubble? These kinds of devices get updated all the time. I have received numerous updates on my Android phone since purchasing it. Same for most other consumer electronic devices I own. Most consumer electronic devices receive some level of software/firmware support after the sale.By these kinds I mean MP3 players. All other upgrades from Apple (including the latest OSs) are free. The reason this particular upgrade wasn't free is because it was listed as device without subscription and for some reason you can't add features to these devices without charge. Note the add features part. The upgrade added a lot of stuff from the iPhone to the iPod that's why it was considered a feature-adding update. Security updates for example were free.The question you're failing to ask yourself is What makes an MP3 player different than a phone???, especially considering an iPod touch was basically just an iPhone without the phone internals. I've owned TONS of consumer devices (MP3 players included) that offered free software/firmware updates. On the other hand, I've owned exactly 0 that charged for those things. That is because, up until the point that Apple tried to get greedy, NOBODY charged for those things and NOBODY, not even Apple, has since. This only stopped because enough people voiced their opinion on the matter. Left up to the fanboys, we would be getting charged for everything.[Read on](http://www.revenuerecognition.com/industry/software)"
"???, and..."
"Android devices (as one example) provide MAJOR updates quite regularly, all without the need to charge. WHAT MADE APPLE DIFFERENT? Even they gave up on trying to charge for these updates after the crap hit the fan.You didn't Read on. Android phones, like iPhones, are registered as devices that adhere to the subscription based business model, and state that they will be enhanced from time to time for free. The iPod didn't adhere to this model initially. Now it does.Judging by your word choice, I'm sure you were nothing but civil when voicing your concerns. Definitely. Although, I surely can't say the same of many of those that were arguing against me.If a Personal Computer (PC) software tried to charge for updates I would switch to something else extremely fast assuming there was an alternate software.Windows aren't freeUpdating to Windows 10 was. I did have to purchase a Windows 7 key though. If they charged for Windows Updates that would be more like what I was referring to."
"Edit - added more thoughts.Yeah, Microsoft changed their business model in respect to Windows quite a bit with the new release. It's clever and for the modern world. But that's not the point. Software in general isn't free. And this particular software wasn't free for an accounting reason...Charging for these kind of updates is more akin to charging for firmware updates, bios updates and drivers than software updates on a full-fledged computer. NOBODY does that. That computer will operate without Windows. Take iOS off of your iPhone and see how far you get. Name one other similar consumer device that charges for updates.There aren't many similar consumer products that get updated regularly...Cell phones (Android, Windows and otherwise), Tablets (Android and otherwise), Game Systems (Xbox, PlayStation, whatever systems Nintendo has now), Blu-ray players, etc..., just to name a few. Most consumer electronic devices offer some level of software/firmware support after the sale.While I agree with you, Charging for firmware updates on such a consumer device is more akin to charging for BIOS updates and drivers. NOBODY does that. Could you imagine being nickled and dimed every time you needed to update anything? What Apple tried to do was set a slippery slope where even something as simple as support after the sale was no longer free.I guess I should have said drivers or important software because that was what I was thinking of. Like imagine if Nvidia charged for major driver updates. Or if my SSD refused to let me diagnosis it in less I paid to I update the software or firmware.This could also be about Apple protecting their security.If this were actually done to protect the owner's security, it would brick or freeze immediately upon replacement of the touch-id sensor. You could imagine someone replacing with a hacked sensor to gain access to the device against the owner's wishes."

"You don't realise you're saying this ironically, because this is exactly what's going on these days.  I don't think that war is over, but currently the manufacturers are winning.I realise...I still don't like it.Except this isn't about the screen. It's about the Touch ID sensor and the cryptographic hash it stores inside that is used in decrypting the storage on the phone not matching after a replacement, which you would know if you read deeper into this than muh ownership rights!!!!1!1!11!!."
"These phones aren't working because a hash that is integral to decrypting the storage device is incorrect.  This is working as designed. "
"If anything the only design flaw it that the iPhone's crypto heart is in a place vulnerable to damage. But like a nutsack, it has to be there for other reasons.It's not even really the heart of the cryptographic features, it's just one of the pieces and all the pieces have to work for the whole to function. So its like the crypto nutsack.I doubt they store cryptographic hashes in the TouchID sensor. It's simply equivalent to a model number. If it doesn't match the expected model number in stored the board, it Error 53s."
"The number is not used for actually decrypting the data. It's not a hash.>This is working as designed."
"I don't think anybody is disputing that. The problem is that the design is bad. Disable the fingerprint sign-in, sure. If Apple wants to convince us that bricking the whole phone is necessary in this situation, they're going to need to give a pretty clear argument why.They didn't intentionally brick the phones!  The phones no longer function because the Touch ID sensor is trying to use an incorrect hash, meaning the security of the device as a whole has been compromised. All the secure components of the phone have a hash that they use to communicate with each other and things don't work when that hash is incorrect. Then the design is bad. If the hash is incorrect, that component's input should be rejected. Bricking the entire phone in this case is at best, lazy.At this point it should be obvious that they did intentionally brick the phones on purpose. Before they were always willing to accept a PIN if the Touch ID sensor couldn't be confirmed. Now they suddenly decided they don't accept a PIN code anymore when the Touch ID sensor doesn't work and the phone just shouldn't start. It's obviously an intentional brick.There's a difference between an incorrect read attempt and the whole chip not having a matching hash or serial number. If the TouchID component was part of a 2 factor authentication required to access the device there might be an argument there - but it's not. You can use a password in place of TouchID to access your phone at any time instead."
"That means that TouchID being integral to accessing the device is not adding additional security when it gets involved in encrypting/decrypting the drive, and bricking the device after a 3rd party replacement serves Apple and not the consumer.Apple's customer support is so good for the most part.  Since Apple Stores opened over 10 years ago, I've gone to them about a dozen times with issues small and large (I've had iMacs, Mac Minis, iPods, IPhones, iPads, Routers, and more)... and they've been really great about just giving me a new device (sometimes upgraded from what I had) if that would be easiest.  I'm sure they don't want to be doing that if people broke it going to someone else."
"Also... with this specific case, it sounds like a thief would be able to replace the Touch ID and gain access to the phone somehow.  And that's why the error shows up.Sorry not buying it, in this particular case yes it could be argued that it's for customers security"
"However, ever install an after market battery from ifixit or similar ? Your phone will work Perfectly, until you update then you'll get error 29"
"Or use a 3rd party cable ? (Because the one supplied is crazy short) the phone throws an error for that too"
"The good customer experience is only tolerable so far, Apple are taking this shit to really petty extremes"
"It's **my** phone I should be able to repair it how I please "
"Ah...the good old It's a function not a bug excuse.Damn people are going to the paint defending this ridiculous level of security. I mean I got important things like credit card info on my phone as well but I don't put a padlock with a self destruct mechanism on my wallet that has my actual cardsYour wallet maker doesn't have security standards set forth by the financial industry that they have to adhere to.Apple weren't forced to do this by the financial industry either, as they also aren't part of the finance industry.? the cards themselves do.If you lose your wallet you just call and get new cards. If someone steals your fingerprint because of a compromised scanner are you going to call and get new hands?Stockholm Syndrome game in this thread is strong.People of Reddit, please hand me all your bitches, money and weed. It is for your own safety.You have to ask yourself: What **should** the phone do?"
"What **should** the phone do when it detects tampering of the phone by an attacker? "
"Ideally it will shut down in order to prevent the leak of any additional information that may have already been compromised."
"It should have considered TouchID void, stop."
"TouchID must be used with a pin, right?"
"Then say TouchID could be compromised, please insert the pin"
"Three tries and then total wipe."
"But this would not allow apple to sell overpriced replacements.They still should have warned users. Arrogant.To play devil's advocate here, one of Apple's main selling points when they released the Finger print ID was security. Separate chip, speicalized software, third-parties only have access to weather or not the scan was successful not the sensor itself. By implementing this error system it means that if someone were to repair a phone and replacing it with a new one it means there is no risk of that new one being fake and say sending the information to a third-party. Even making it where its difficult to change at an Apple store means an employee can't try pulling a stunt. Locking out a phone like this means they're covering their asses from any potential lawsuits about information being stolen.Why do people still buy Apple with all the problems they have? The answer to those problems is simple. do not buy Apple.Just stop buying Apple.That is a nasty little surprise for anyone to find out, and Apple monopolizing the iPhone repair business. iPhones are electronic devices, let people fix their devices at a fair rate.No! Not when it comes to Encryption, and the storage of YOUR bio-metric data!"
"With this level of security you are just going to have to let go of the whole It's my phone, and I'll do what I want with it mentality."
"Because anything that directly interfaces with Banks, Credit card companies, and the like is more assuredly NOT your device to do with, as you please.Apple's iOS development team must be headed by a total fucking idiot."
"Oh wait."
"r/thanksjonyive"
"This sounds so much like You're holding it wrong.... and our profits.Looking forward to the Apple Car!  Every single part down to the tires must be an officially authorized Apple component or the car breaks down in the middle of the road for your protection.Thumbprint access security is actually pretty important to a lot of people. I don't get what all these people are mad about. When you buy Apple, you are locked into their system. I'm surprised these people didn't already know this.Yeah, there is a fairly significant difference between the protected, walled garden of apps and bricking a device over getting the phone repaired locally.I thought this would have been on /r/nottheonionMaybe people should quit being so careless with their 700-1000 dollar devices that contain irreplaceable data. Just saying. They mean the security of their income.Just add this to list of reasons if why I fucking hate apple and will never use any of their products again>This security measure is necessary to protect your device and prevent a fraudulent Touch ID sensor from being used."
"Translation: too many repair shops taking away from money we rightfully are owed. Nobody seems to realize the potential for fake replacement chips that build in malware. It's improbable, but possible.  If someone wanted to steal a whole lot of identities, dirty replacement parts are a great point of entry.  Apple is taking a heavy handed but understandable approach.  It's not unreasonable, but it is overboard.Hey - Hey Apple."
"Try not breaking shit when you update your OS.As a long time Android owner,  I must say I'm happy I've avoided this catastrophe.   I completely understand and sometimes have to weigh the decision to void my warranty by having an unofficial fix for a device,  or pay the extra money for an official one.  But this decision is not about warranty at all.  It is a giant company like Apple FORCING people to only use their official repair service. This bullying and underhanded policy is,  I believe, going to end up having Apple backtrack this decision quickly and/or have Apple in one hell of a lawsuit.  It would be one thing if this was explained and agreed to before-hand.  It's another to pull a stunt like this afterward and hurt the millions of loyal fanboys without a care, all to dominate the market.  Just sickening.  To anyone that is going through this. ..you have my sympathy. Yup - that makes sense - however it would make MORE SENSE to TELL EVERYONE ABOUT IT BEFORE WHEN YOU BUY THE PHONE>Logic indicates that it is *time* to switch to AndroidKill the patient to cure the malady.. that's the Apple way!!!Yes, to protect security in the same way that patching jailbreaks protects security."
"They're not wanting to protect your security, they're wanting to prevent you from modding the phone in ways they don't agree with.Patching jailbreak exploits does protect security.  The same exploits you can use to gain complete control over your phone could also be used by others, in conjunction with a lesser exploit or social engineering attack, with severe consequences.  Similarly, the security feature here protects you from a real attack where someone installs a fraudulent replacement for the fingerprint sensor.  Similarly, auto manufacturers aren't *completely* lying when they say it's safer to spend multiple times the price for name brand car parts."
"The lesson here is a different one: if you make it too difficult to accomplish what your customers want while maintaining security, then your customers will do insecure things.  It is then dishonest to refuse to acknowledge responsibility for the resulting mess.I have an easy fix! only involves 2 steps. 1. Throw the iPhone out the window into a ditch because they suck 2. Get an Android :DThat's okay, I like knowing my device will receive updates consistently and not get dropped like a hot rock in a year. The only thing Apple is protecting is profit margin. "
"Yes, and it is. It would pose an *enormous* security risk if someone could just swap out the button to unlock the phone. Apple is basically the only manufacturer that gives a shit about security nowadays, and all reddit wants to do is bitch. You broke your phone. Instead of getting it fixed through apple, you took it to a cell phone repair place, voided the warranty, and bricked your phone. It's *your* fault. What they're doing is entirely reasonable. Fingerprints are very insecure anyway, it doesn't matter if you try to build a fort when you leave the front door unlockedEspecially so on a touchscreen device. Your phone is literally covered in your fingerprints.Or, paint copies of the key all over the outside of the fort.> and bricked your phone"
"You didn't brick your phone. The phone was bricked when Apple told you to upgrade your OS, and the OS decided to brick your phone that was working fine before."
"If Apple instead said Your phone is no longer compatible with iOS9, so instead of bricking it, we'll disallow upgrading the OS, that would be reasonable."
"To say You got your phone fixed 2 years ago while you were on a work assignment far from any authorized Apple repair shops, and just now we're noticing that, so we're going to brick your phone  but not tell you why, that's clearly a different situation."
"How long are Apple phones in warranty anyway? Why do I care if I void the one year warranty three years after I buy the phone?Then just disable Touch ID and have the user input a password. problem solved.Even a simple warning prior to the update that alerts users that their phone may cease to function if it has had any repairs from an unauthorized source. That way people could forgo the update. "
"But hey, the person above you is right, it is absolutely the user's fault that Apple decided to make an update that would brick a device with no warning./s"
"Of course there is still the issue of some phones being bricked that never received replacement parts, but rather just experienced some minor damage from a drop while still remaining fully functional. "
"I suppose Apple bricking a fully functional device without prior notice is somehow the user's fault, too. Stupid pleebs deserve a bricked device for not cradling their phone like a baby/sDoes this happen with Apple Authorized repair shops? Or are they not allowed to replace TouchID sensors? Aside from the cost, I can't think of a good reason to take an iPhone to an un-authoroized 3rd party repair person.convenience? My parents have someone in their town that claims to repair apple products while the nearest apple store is about 50 miles away.Do they have an authorized 3rd party repair place near them? Or just un-authorized ones? It's all moot if the authorized shops aren't allowed to replace them, but if they are then I would imagine there is an authorized place near them and that is where they should go.I work at a large company that all of sudden is going to start offering iphone screen repair to our customers.  Our current business model has nothing to do with phones at all so it's sort of a weird thing to get into.  "
"I brought this up yesterday to two of the project managers and emailed them the article from the guardian.  One of them forwarded it on, but not sure how serious they took it.  If we end up bricking even one customers phone by offering this service, it's going to be a shitstorm.  I had this problem with a used iPhone 6 I bought.  Seller never disclosed the screen had been replaced by a third party.  Touch ID wouldn't work so I sent it in to Apple since the phone was still under warranty.  Apple sent it back with the warranty voided and now with the error 53.  I fought with them for a couple of weeks, having the phone shipped back to Apple a couple of times, before they gave me a refurb.  Well, your data is certainly safe....I get that it's a security concern which is fine, but they went about this in a terrible way. They should have implemented off the factory line on all iPhones with touch id and it should be bricked immediately after the repair so you can at least get the repairman to buy you a new phone and you would have (if you are smart) backed up your phone before the repair. Pushing out an update that bricks phones is a terrible way to go about this.Yea, there are ways to do this without being an asshole.  Like maybe just release a warning: listen guys before you let someone other than us fix your phone, just know we will disable it if you do.So I bought a refurbished iPhone off eBay from a very highly rated power seller"
"But who knows, maybe my home button was replaced?  I know better then to wait at least a month before any Apple updates as they routinely butcher something but if this doesn't change it looks like I won't be updating my phone any time soon. "
"1. test you finger print sensor in Settings -> Touch ID"
"- if it works you will be fine and not get an error 53 situation."
"- if it says failed it means your finger print sensor if faulty.  (for whatever reason, it's not repairs it could be damage or a fault)."
"NOW to avoid bricking your phone you simply need to disable the touch sensor function and you will be fine.  It is as simple as that. Louis Ross [made a good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMbE8Uaiq3w) ,he's a phone repair guy, i mean,the approach apple took could be wrong but there are reasons behind it.Hey customers you're doing it wrong so we bricked your phone without warning"
"Things like this just bug me because for the most part people don't care, not really. I can't see this having any real lasting affect on Apple at all. Peoples rights being withered away slowly, day by day and people have just come to accept it. What other option do we have as consumers? They don't play fair and grow larger and larger whilst we have to suck it up and be grateful. Doesn't just go for Apple but for the majority of big corporations. Dragged into a cycle of throwing money at them in order to stay up with the Jones' or because we simply have no other option.Just disable Touch ID and make them type their password. Fucking simple. As much as I love apple products, I am starting to want their entire company policy to crash and burn the entire company. i use the touchid sensor to sign into my banking app among other things... i dont know if it is lazy engineering but i'm thankful for the lazy security?Is it only related to the touch sensor or other parts, too?This is how you accelerate your decline in market share. People talk, people learn and people change their purchasing habits.  Louis has a new video onto this topic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMbE8Uaiq3w This thread is so full of analogies. I love it. Whole 'Prometheus' movie.This is why I rarely update. And yet there will still be 3 mile long queues when the next iPhone is released...That makes perfect sense. With third party repairs, hardware n' shit it's safer to completely kill the phone than risk letting a user fuck up their life by trusting something shadyHow prevalent is this? I've read multiple threads on this topic and there are a lot of people upset at Apple for doing this but I've yet to see one person in the threads say they have the error and share the circumstances. Would be curious to hear! Tim Cook: Execute order, 66...You should be able to opt out....You Opt out, by not phone any phone that has bio-fucking-metrics in it!At least it isn't Error 66. Honest question; if this is illegal why is Tesla allowed to do the same thing with their cars?Yeah, some third party software could brick your phone, or people could be recording your conversations and selling them to advertisers, or looking at all of your personal information... Thanks for being the one to do that to us, Apple. At least it's a name we trust! Round of applause for Apple and how they always put their customers first by giving them errors. Splendid job there guys. I think part of this comes from Apple being 'the' only approved hardware source and countless 'fix yo iphone' companies sourcing their low cost replacement parts from alternative and sometimes straight up sketchy manufacturers."
"Not long ago I used a really reputable online source to replace a broken screen for my iPad..  The glass I received ended up being slightly warped and not at the level of quality I expected given the price I paid..   "
"I'm confident that the glass I got was either rejected OEM that found its way into the market or it was a Chinese knock-off.. Either way it clearly did not come from official Apple manufacturers and I was not happy with the quality."
"From this shit experience and the overall inconsistent responsiveness I now get using that new glass, I will never use or recommend anyone use anything less than official Apple repair shops to fix their devices.I've had my iPhone 5s since they came out. I've never needed any repairs(I also haven't dropped the phone but a handful of times from 2 feet). If Apple truly has their customer's best interests in mind, they would add some sort of functionality to the OS where you can disable that 'error 53' function by inputting your password.so here is my story. "
"touch id stopped working in december. I couldn't be bothered to have it fixed so I just turned it of. "
"PHONE HAS NEVER BEEN TO ANY REPAIR SHOP. 3RD PARTY OR NOT. "
"and now it's bricked. "
"how in the hell is that fair?TiL that Apple's profits improve customer security. If it was to protect customer's security, the problem would have occured immediately after the replacement was made, not months afterwards.ITT: People with no understanding of how hardware and encryption works grabbing their pitchforks.In other words it bricks it per NSA contract. Any third party repairs could void or disable the tracking on it. Once it's recognized it seizes up. I always deNSA my stuff at my local repair shopLOL sure."
"and lenovo's built in malware was for security too."
"fuck off, apple.  by security you mean we want people to pay $1000 for repairs at the GENIUS BAR.$1,000,000 for repair at the APPLE STORE>security feature"
"Well I can see where they're coming from...."
">applied retroactively through software update"
"Yeah, this is just apple being dickheads again, isn't it?"
"Golly, what a bad company."
"If only there were other phones on the market I could buy!It's simple really. The sanctity of the fingerprint scanner has to be maintained under all circumstances. I think it's the right move to brick the phone if the sensor has been tempered with.Or just roll back to using PIN-only (or just a swipe if the user chooses)? If Touch ID was the only authentication option then hard bricking would make a bit more sense. The truth is, it isn't the only authentication method available on iOS.I could see if swapping the fingerprint scanner forces you to do a factory wipe of the phone's contents like unlocking an Android phone's bootloader, but by no circumstances should it permanently brick the phone and make it unrepairable and unusable from that point on.Apple hates democracy.As an Apple phone user, as much as I hate this, I have to say this is a necessary evil. With Apple Pay you don't want third party repairers tampering with that. It's a shame it's with all phone generations though. Sounds like it's a win win position for Apple too since they can collect all revenue for repairs while backing it with a decent excuse. Instead of bricking the phone, just have it disable TouchID and apple pay.That's... Actually, now I want to know, why can't they do that?They want to stop 3rd party and diy repairs so they can make more money.Mmm hmm, I'm calling shenanigans. Well they aren't lying but they could go about it In a better way.It's a feature.Who on earth would believe the it's for your safety line?  Its pretty clear they just want the monopoly to fix their (very fragile) devices.These issues could be mitigated if apple wasn't infatuated with the hardware home button and went with a capacitive home button. Obviously the hardware home button is flawed with the amount it needs to be replaced.Ya'll know that fingerprints aren't even a little bit private, right? That a decent DSLR can pick em up from across a room? That you leave them all over hotels and offices and restaurants? "
"Apple's fingerprint scanner is security for people who read the paper newspaper and want to spend money to make the nervous feeling go away.If I had anything to protect (i.e. If I were a wealthy businessman with nude photos of my many mistresses) I'm sure I'd appreciate what Apple is doing.  However, as a random guy who is lower middle class (and can afford an iPhone, but just barely) that kind of security is more annoying than anything else.  So android is for me, but I see what Apple is trying to do and I have no problem with it.In fairness, that is, in fact, a huge security risk. The iPhone has its fingerprint system completely isolated from the main system. It doesn't matter how much you 'hack into' it, it's separated by hardware, you cannot get a user's fingerprint from the main system. Introduce non-standard hardware that could be doing...who knows what, and you break down the security.Is requiring apple to verify that the fingerprint sensor was not tampered with secure? Sure. "
"Is it a security flaw that will affect more than .01% of Apple customers? Fuck. No."
"Did Apple make this decision because of security? Fuck No!"
"No, they did it to make people give them those sweet $$$ for the home button repairs. It's a multibillion dollar industry that they can't do without.That is exactly what I was getting at.While voiding the warrenty is reasonable, there is no reason for Apple to effectively sabotage your phone following a 3rd party (or DIY) repair. The consumers drop a lot of money on these products and they should have the right to manage their property however they want to. "
"Seriously, fuck Apple.At some point people should stop to buy apple products.We stop to buy Apple products constantly!Defective by design.As if I needed more reason to never own a single apple product. I've started to go off Apple. Really... this kind of thing, and also how usually their products seem to have or develop a critical flaw that they don't always fix (bending iPhone 6, iPhone 4 antenna problems, magsafe adapters that need to be replaced every year). Magnussen-Mossy for electronics when?  All this is is a thinly veiled monopoly on parts and service.  Which since the phones are sold most of the time through carriers, is a guaranteed money maker.   This cuts out the cottage industry of repair.  They make more money when people have to come in for service.It's Apple..are you really ..really really that surprised? I don't own an apple product but why do they have the right to do this to consumers after they've already purchased the item. It's pretty ridiculous that if I owned a phone I couldn't put an aftermarket part onto it to ensure it continues functioning after their original parts fail.I refuse to use anything Apple... they're so anti-customer it isn't even remotely funny. The Error 53 is all about the money.Perhaps Apple should have told people before they needed their phone fixed, like on their website before purchase?Apple does care about security but not so much in relation to the consumer end on this issue.  This is all about money relating with security primarily with APPLE PAY.  They need secure verification and most likely required by the contracts they signed with the credit card companies associated with it.  Security for consumers is a secondary thought.  I'm sure ANDROID PAY will be the same soon.  Assume that jailbreaking and modding related issues will be mitigated as a major focus in the apple's and google's future of security for consumers as the inclusion of secured transactions aka APPLE PAY and ANDROID PAY will require apple and android to make their systems more secure.> Apple does care about security but not on the consumer end."
"You're right, of course. The phone can't be encrypted, TouchID doesn't exist and the PIN is still restricted to four digits. lemme rephrase to fulfill your misinterpretation of my statement.  Apple cares about security but NOT AS MUCH as the BUSINESS END due to contractual agreements.  And this is specifically for this latest touch ID related scenario is what i'm commenting on.  Apple does care about consumer security but this event is not related as much about that.Apparently Apple subscribes to the 'Dead phones tell no tales' school of security. I can see that for people who hold a security clearance (and not using their personal phone, mind you), but there seems to be very little bathwater thrown out with this particular baby.Hey here's a crazy idea there are competition in the phone market so since Apple is shit both price and hardware. Except for the brand of course you could stop buying their stuff since they treat you as customers bad. Why do they do this? Because they can since people will just complain and continue buying their shit.You guys know that the government is installing chips and back doors into devices... So why the outrage over Apple protecting customers?Apple makes unrepairable devices and punishes anybody who tries to repair them"
"Fuck that shit!Uh except the part about maintenance...and my post was about defining what anti competition is, not about your first argument, which is something you're still not understanding.  You're defending a company that delivers a broken product, that requires you to only send it back to them to repair, preventing any other party from the ability to repair it.  That's the argument here, and it falls under anticompetition because it isnt faulty equipment, its then programming that decides to wipe your data if the device is tampered with...say at a third party repair store.  Thats anticompetitive.  Its preventing a maintenance, even by the owner, to open the device and solve the problem by replacing a part.  It forces you to stay under a warranty or shell out for a repair from Apple directly.  "
"That would be like buying a car, owning it for 10 years, and when the battery dies you have to ship the car back to the dealership, rather than being able to replace the battery yourself or having Autozone do it.  Another reason not to buy an iPhone. I'm good with that.Its like Pa used to say:"
"Don't buy a BMW if you cant afford the maintenance costs. "
"When you buy a $800 phone, why would you take it to the chop shop?Not all 3rd party repairs are evil. Sometimes the actual dealerships are worse when it comes to repairs and over chargesSo if I understand this correctly it bricks the phone if you get it repaired by someone who doesn't know to move the touch sensor to the new screen? Sounds like people should use an authorized repair service then. The fight should be against the repair people. They are the ones that didn't repair the phone correctly. If you take your car somewhere and after leaving your engine blows up because they didn't repair it correctly you don't go after the car manufacturer. Maybe I'm missing something but with apples products it seems if you don't have them fix it this kind of stuff can happen. Glad I have an android phone.It doesn't brick the device right after the repair -- the phone works fine without Touch ID. It's when you try to do the next iOS update that the phone is bricked.  So you paid the guy at the mall kiosk his $50 or whatever and you are happy. But you're left with an Apple-designed time bomb.  Next time you update (or factory reset) your phone, it'll become a brick."
"If it bricked right away, third parties would not keep offering to replace home buttons, because they would never be able to complete a repair successfully. Instead, people keep doing this repair because they do not associate the action (repair) with the consequence (intentional bricking by Apple).  "
"This undermines their argument that it's for customer security.  They let customers use the potentially insecure hardware for whatever amount of time between the repair and the upgrade. That is usually a months-long period. Then they should make it check the sensor on every boot. If you have the money to buy apple products you shouldn't cheap out when it comes time to repair it. And everyone should back up their data somewhere besides icloud. Yes, doing it on boot is completely rational and obvious. I am really surprised they don't check until a restore or update. You dont understand correctly."
"Someone has a phone but it breaks. They go to Apple to get it fixed but Apple want $260 for the repair, they then go to a normal phone shop who want $50 or $100 for the same job. They replace the faulty sensor and the phone works fine for a few months."
"Apple push updated software, detects non OEM sensor, bricks phone with no warning. "
"People angry. Understandably. They then claim it is about security but there is no evidence that any security has been compromised and they failed to warn users their equipment will be broken.I understand that people are angry and I do think it should have bricked it immediately saying the touch id was not the original. If it's a non apple approved repair shop though it voids your warranty. I don't even use apple products because of how ridiculous their costs for everything are. I still think people should back up their data because if you lose your phone from it bricking or even theft the data on it is your responsibility.Its not about data. Its about $1000 worth of hardware basically now held for ransom."
"Voiding the warranty is only relevant if you take it to Apple and claim the failure is their fault, which would not be the case if you dropped it on the floor."
"Imagine filling your car up at the local supermarket petrol station and then paying but on returning to your car you find all the doors locked. The car would still run. Maybe the petrol has a different ethanol percentage than the Shell stuff that your car's manufacturer recommended. Only, they did recommend but last night they upgraded your cars firmware and now you can ONLY put Shell fuels in it."
"You did take your possessions with you when you paid, right? Your dog? No? Well that's your fault you idiot.  "
"You could try smashing the window but you paid extra for this model because of the security features like unbreakable glass.>but there is no evidence that any security has been compromised"
"If the touch ID sensor has been replaced, and you use it to authenticate, then security *has* been compromised. They're right about that."
"But there's just no reason to brick the phone. Just reject the input from the sensor.They are implying that there is potential for some man-in-the-middle attack or somesuch if you have a third party print scanner."
"I am asking if anything like this has happened or if it actually can, not some technicalityThe scenario they're protecting against isn't a MITM attack or any situation where you are still in possession of your phone. The attack, as I understand it, is that someone else has your phone, and they use a hacked sensor to break into it without knowing your password.I got downvoted talking about how much more I like my iPhone than my galaxy. Reddits hate for Apple is ridiculous haha. Unless it was in a thread about comparing the iphone to the Galaxy your comment was out of place and nobody gives a shit, that's why you got downvoted.There are people who buy Apple products and still want to making hardware/software changes/fixes without Apple trying to stop them. LOLSo, basically any time an iPhone breaks, Apple's response will be uh, it's supposed to do that. this whole thing just makes me laugh "
"I was an Apple fanboy up until 5 years ago when I had to replace my iphone 6 times inside a year "
"I had a macbook ipad and phone but when my phone softwear kept getting corrupted and i had to replace it I just said screw it and switched everything and have never had reason to regret itFunny I had the same thing happen to me with an Android phone and went to apple and have never looked back.Why do people still buy iPhones? You know what would work better than bricking the phone? Disabling Touch ID and forcing users to login with a password.I want this to bite Apple in the arse. I really do.As always, people are making a big deal out of a small thing...this only affects the Touch ID sensor and cable. As long as you swap over those items when getting your screen replaced, there is nothing to worry about.    "
"Why this outrage is especially stupid is because Apple charges pretty good rates for repairs, often times slightly cheaper than third party shops. But again, if you don't wanna have Apple fix your phone, just make sure to preserve those parts.I call bullshit. Nice try Apple. Except that this isn't to protect customers, it's to fleece people out of even more money.  Apple can get fucked. Explain how it's not to protect customers.  Go.... This is confusing to me - it is well known that third-party modifications on any Apple device void the warranty. It is also known that if Apple discovers third-party modifications on your phone, they refuse service. "
"If you're too lazy to take the iPhone to an ASP to have the home button replaced (it literally costs $79 OOW) then frankly you should know that if anything goes wrong with the phone in the future, then you're on your own."
"Source: Am Apple Service Tech.This isn't something going wrong with your phone - this is Apple completely disabling the phone because it detects a non-Apple part. That's like GM not letting you start your car because you didn't bring it into the dealership to have your brake pads changed. Sure, you won't get a warranty on the home button and can't get it fixed by Apple, but how is it acceptable for a company to restrict a user of a device they paid close to a thousand dollars for to use their part and service techs for repair when there are replacements that you can install yourself for less than a quarter of the cost or take to a repair shop for less than half. I do agree that it is over the top, however Apple is known for doing things like this - why is this such a surprise?"
"Most of the time, if your device is within warranty, even for an OOW repair you can get warranty coverage by calling Applecare and getting a CS code. I've had customers get phones which had been completely destroyed (water damage, run over by car, thrown against wall) get replaced at no cost just from calling Applecare and kicking up a stink."
"If you've spent $1000 on a phone, surely you'd want to keep the warranty get it serviced properly, yeah? $79 isn't much to pay for peace of mind and guaranteed service.Hey guys! I'm Apple and I'm helping you out.  You know that third party hardware you used to fix your phone 9 months ago?  Well, it turns out it could have been used to HACK YOUR SHIT!"
"So, nine months ago when you replaced your home button, I neglected to check for unofficial hardware *at boot*.  Instead, *I let you use your potentially hacked phone for 9 months*, entering your PIN, sexting, recording your location constantly, typing in your SSN to your car insurance app.  You know, that kind of private stuff you do all the time that you want to keep private. "
"But then I got around to checking for EVIL HACKING HARDWARE I found some!!! So now your phone is a brick, to protect you.  After all, if someone added EVIL HACKING HARDWARE to your phone, you should know about it *eventually*. "
"But it's your fault. You should've known not to trust the guy who said he could fix your phone, and who made your phone work again, minus Touch ID, until you made the completely straightforward decision to update your apparently working phone. "
"With Love,"
"Your best buddies at Apple who totally care about your security and can't think of a better way to check more frequently for unauthorized hardware related to encryption. "
"Disclaimer: I use an iPhone and I really wish they would fix this. It's fucking stupid and it's transparent. I'm absolutely not defending apple in any way, but something stood out to me about your first couple sentences. "
"> So, nine months ago when you replaced your home button, I neglected to check for unofficial hardware *at boot*."
"The thing is, I've had a Droid Turbo for over a year now, and I had to fix the screen on it after I dropped it. I didn't even turn the phone off. I simply put it to sleep, replaced the screen, and that was that. Never rebooted or anything. So even if they checked *at boot* it's still possible to replace parts without rebooting. And I've used my phone without issues for 3 months now without rebooting.That's a good point. Poll hourly? Ever time touch ID is used? The point is to get the consequence (bricked phone) closer to the cause (third party repair)"
"If your phone is bricked as soon as you turn it on after the swap, you immediately deal with it. Nine months or a year later, the guy at the mall kiosk is gone. You might not even remember the repair. But what if I broken my Touch ID?this is why you use ios 7 or 8 and just keep it like that with a jail break and that's it no problems everA lot of people had their App Store accounts compromised (un/pw stolen) because jail breaking bypasses all security. iPhone user agreement and software license, sections 7.3 through 8, can be translated as so what? You accepted these terms and conditions by using iOS, so....I BUY Apple devices. They LEND ME the OS. It has always been clear to me. you dont actually own your iphone . no really , go check , its in the terms and conditions that apple owns itsure, now your apple device is a nice brick!"
"good job!Even if you are borrowing the OS, Apple should not be able to destroy my hardware. I have payed for the phone and the intentional destruction of my property is unjustified. > one Guardian reader comments: I think they made an after-the-fact adjustment to a poorly conceived and implemented security system on the iPhone. They hadn't properly considered the implications of third parties substituting parts on the phones, whether these were bonafide alterations or not."
"I think that's giving Apple too much credit.  Everything the company does is designed to create a captive market.  iOS, the itunes store, the lightning cables, everything is you can only use apple and pay whatever we decide to charge you.  "
"Why would anybody give them the benefit of the doubt when claim to have a good reason for doing it again?  They're a corporation.  They exist to make money.  That's what they're doing and they know they're doing.It's like when you buy a apple product you dont own it but apple still owns your device I bought a house and decided to cut the foundation because it says so in the Holy Book. The house fell. It's like I didn't own the house at all!I don't understand why you can't dismantle it and get the SD card out, plug it into a PC and retrieve your data."
"If this is hard to do, someone should make a kit that takes the flash memory and lets you plug it into an SD card slot or USB slot."
"Maybe someone can explain what I'm missing (since I use Android).You are missing basic knowledge and understanding of how these devices work.yes, but the data is stored somewhere in the phone. Why don't people just take it apart and get at it?  There are a lot of ingenious hackers and electronic technicians out there.The simplest answer is because they are encrypted. The passcode you enter to unlock your phone isn't just a protection of the user interface. It's hard coded encryption system that renders your data unreadable if you don't have it. The whole encryption war that is now once again debated is for this reason. If a government agency or anyone else could simply take the memory out of your phone and read it somewhere else, what's the point of a passcode?initiate protocol 66"
"TIL apple is run by a modern day sith lord.With the grand plan of taking all those button repairs moneys.Do we really want people to be able to tinker with Touch ID? Anyone who knows anything about Encryption, Bio-metrics, and security will firmly tell you NO!This is premo security.... No one can access the device the device is pretty secure....Because it fucking is"
"Apple takes its eye off the ball: Why Apple fans are really coming to hate Apple softwareI'm 52 and I think I'm doing fairly well keeping up with consumer tech. But whenever I try to do something useful on iTunes on my laptop, I wonder for a minute if perhaps I don't actually know how to use computers, or maybe I did know how to but have recently had the knowledge of those skills removed by a brain aneurysm that I've forgotten about. "
"I usually just give up and go have some toast and soft-boiled eggs. "
"Just turned 25 and every time I use Itunes I think I've finally hit the age where I'm losing touch with technology. I don't think anyone can use iTunes effectively."
"As someone who's been around computers for my whole life, iTunes is the worst I've ever had to deal with. Thankfully I moved onwards to android and I'll never have to use iTunes again.Ive worked supporting iTunes to certain customers and had problems explaining its erratic behaviors. So yeah..iTunes is probably #3 most frustrating thing in technology, behind printing (#2), and using any computer owned by someone who insists on installing everything that pops up in their web browser (#1).My 55-year-old dad uses iTunes to archive all the rips of his 1000+ CDs, since he has an iPod."
"But he actually *catalogues* them using Excel, of all things. So basically, Windows Excel is a better music sorting program than iTunes.To be fair, excel can do almost anything.Same here. I'm 45, been using computers for decades, building websites for the past ten years, provide tech support to everyone I know, teach courses in computing and web design at the community college level, but I'll be fucked if I can get a goddam movie from my daughter's iPod to my iMac without having an existential crisis.Hahaha! Man, that cracked me up. It seems so odd to me that you can't drag and drop files to an iPhone that's connected to a computer. And it makes me glad to own an Android device.That was the first thing that absolutely blew my mind about Apple devices. You can't just drop files on the device, *everything* has to go through itunes."
"Always had an Android smartphone, but my work gave us all Apple phones to use at work. I constantly found myself saying how is anybody ok with this? when discovering all the things the device *can't* do."
"I couldn't jailbreak the phone because it wasn't mine, but I think a lot of my problems would have been solved by that."
"."
"Haha, ya know, just the words they use for jailbreak vs rooting characterize the difference."
"An Android user can be given root access, they call it what it is - superuser access to the root directory. But over on the Apple side, they call it jailbreak because you're usually confined and denied basic freedom.I just posted a very similar story. I'm in a band as an Android user with three iPhone users. We need to pass recordings to each other frequently and through Dropbox."
"It seems like nearly every technical issue is because of something iPhone simply can't do, and usually related to them being completely unable to access their files through any sort of explorer. That is an absolutely insane limitation to me."
"When I tried to troubleshoot these problems on their phones I, too, kept saying How is anybody OK with this? They basically babyproofed their OS. That's great if you're critically tech illiterate, but for anyone who regularly uses a PC or Mac without it bursting into flames, it's such overkill.I'm only 35 and I've used computers my entire life (since I was 10 or 11).  It's my hobby and my career.  "
"Still no fucking clue how to use iTunes.  Every time I start it up, it's a crap shoot whether it see any of the new apps/music, ask for some kind of weird authorization, pair my device to that computer for all eternity?  If I sync it, it always seems to remove shit from the apple product (maybe if it doesn't exist on the computer, I don't really know)."
"I just want to manage my music.  Even fucking drag and drop would be nice.  I don't want to worry about my entire apple ecosystem to add a new song.Oh yeah, the fucking synching.  Jesus.  I don't want to completely erase one library and replace it with another.  I don't even want to have to worry that that will happen.  I JUST WANT TO MOVE A FUCKING FILE.  Preach it!  I completely fucked up my whole itunes account by synching incorrectly.  It took all the energy and dark forces I could muster to fix it.  A month later I bought a Samsung note.  Now have an S6.  The end.Sync is scary.Straight up. I work at a computer store and I couldn't begin to tell you the amount of times where a customer comes in and they've lost all their important documents and media due to syncing fuckups.Transferring files and Apple simply do not fit in the same room. Take any other computer, phone or a tablet, and you can just plug it in and transfer files. Any file. Any folder. Anywhere. Apple is totally allergic to anything related to transferring files. Childish restrictions like this annoy me...It took me a long time to realize that my iPhone-using friends had no access to their actual files through any sort of generic file explorer. I wanted one friend to put an audio recording in our shared Dropbox folder..."
"Several ways to accomplish on Android, zero to accomplish on iPhone. I kept telling him to just find the audio file itself and he genuinely didn't know what I meant outside of viewing it in the audio recorder."
"It still blows my mind. I never thought I'd be grateful just because Android let's me directly access my own files."
"EDIT: before anyone else explains how easy it is now, the ability to share to Dropbox was only added since this story took place (about a year or so ago). At the time, you could text the files (which converted them to unusably shitty .amr files) or email them. If you wanted them on Dropbox, you had to email them to someone without such ridiculous limitations.This is why I'll never use an iOS device. That is way too locked down.Yet i have extremely tech-savvy friends who like to customize and tweak the shit out every thing they get their hands on, yet at the same time  swear by their iPhone. I never understood that.Yeah the idea that people do not understand folder hierarchy and things like file types / associations in 2016 is mind boggling."
"We have taken a huge step back from stuff I thought would be mandatory by now."
"Though perhaps I am getting out of touch because the idea of syncing pictures offsite bugs me. Deleting local copy or deleting both copies... knowing which pictures are actually on my phone... it gets frustrating and o long for the days where I occasionally plugged in and backed shit up.Preview isn't great. But its problems are peanuts next to iTunes, iMovie, Mail or such."
"I'd love to be able to delete some of the Apple apps off my iPhone. Why the hell did Apple make Podcasts a built-in now? Because it was so bad they didn't think people would use it any other way?Create a folder. Put all the garbage applications into the folder. Name the folder with the poop emoji."
"It's not the same as deleting the apps, but it feels good.I feel like that's part of the modern age of computing. You have a managed device that you have very limited control over. apple has allowed very limited control since the iphone 1Mine's called iJunk.The good ol' crapple folderMine is called UnwantediShit for meI wouldn't call myself an Apple fan, though I do own several of their products. I can safely say that iTunes is one of the worst pieces of software I have ever had the misfortune of using. That and it seems every iOS update makes my devices slower, that is when it isn't bricking them. There was a time when I loved iTunes. Back when all it did was music and podcasts. Those days are a long long time ago.Really? Because I honestly cannot recall a time when iTunes *didn't* suck. I mean, seriously, I remember using it about ten years ago and it sucked. And every year in-between. The only goddamn reason I have it is because the iphone requires having it when you want to put your mp3s on the damn thing.It was pretty good until about 2007.I think it might just be an age thing. I didn't use my computer for much more than listening to music and trolling around 4chan. I think the most intensive thing I did was watch flash videos on newgrounds since youtube didn't exist yet. Any short comings of iTunes were unnoticeable to me. Now I have chrome tabs for days, skype, spotify, photoshop cs6, and a bunch of other background processes that I'm sure would make it more noticeable. The experience between using iTunes on Windows and iTunes on a Mac are very different. Probably done on purpose, too. Is the interface the same? Because that a lot of the suckage. "
"And the music player on the iPhone has been getting worse and worse. Thankfully they added back a shuffle all button, but you cant go to the rest of the album from a shuffled song now... Interface is the same, but the Windows version is known to be much buggier and crashes much more often. Yeah iTunes on mac is not bad.  On Windows it's worse than McAfeeMcAfee should treat it as a virus...I had an iPhone 3G back when they were new and iTunes was such a disaster that I refused to touch an apple product for over 7 years."
"Here's the story. I was married back in 2008 and my wife and I both got 3G's. We only had one computer in the house between us both, and at the time you had to plug your phone into a computer and use iTunes to upgrade it. I never had any desire to use iTunes, but Apple forced me to."
"The time to upgrade the operating system on the phones came about at the same time my marriage was ending. My wife wasn't very tech savvy, so I told her I would upgrade her phone for her. I plugged her phone in and started the update process. It took over 2 hours to complete the process, which is absolutely insane. It should have taken a couple of minutes to transfer a file over to the phone and maybe 10-15 to upgrade it, but no Apple made this process a complete pain in the ass."
"After finishing with her phone I started on my phone. It took even longer than hers and it also completely gutted my phone. It removed all my apps and pictures and replaced them with hers. It removed about half of my contacts and added about half of her contacts to my phone. I have no fucking idea why Apple decided it was a good idea to shuffle around everything on your phone while you are just trying to do an upgrade. There was absolutely no warning that my apps and contacts would be modified in any way. I was horrified and there was no way to undo the damage."
"I spent days trying to get all my contacts and apps back to where they were. The pictures were gone and there was no way I could find to recover them. I refused to let iTunes touch my phone again out of pure anxiety and fear that it would destroy everything again."
"Then it happened. My wife had moved out and we had just started the process to file for divorce. This is the point at which I went to my phone and clicked on the contact labelled 'Dad'. I was in complete shock and horror when the person on the end of the line was not my dad at all. It was my soon to be ex-father-in-law who began cursing me out in a tirade that took me months to recover from."
"iTunes was a disaster back in 2008. I don't know how it is now and I will never know how it is now because for the rest of my life I will never touch that program again. The user experience was the absolutely furthest thing from anything even slightly resembling user-friendly."
"I switched to Android as fast as I could and the OTA updates were a breath of fresh air. It took me until 2015 to touch an Apple product again, and that was a mac book air that I used for backpacking around the world. The touch-pad integration is amazing, but the apps themselves aren't all that easy to use and some of them suffer from issues that make them almost completely unusable (I'm looking at you photos app)."
"tl;dr: iTunes traumatized me for life.Pretty much sums up why I've always been an Android user. Had a 3GS that my sister gave me as a hand me down and it lasted about 5-6 months before I gave it the flick. I shouldn't be forced to wipe my phone if I'm connecting it to someone else PC or doing a simple upgrade. Reading that reminds me about back when I was into Apple products. I don't have any specific horror stories like yours, but I definitely remember the horrifying feeling of having no way to know if iTunes would remove all my data or not.My wife decided to get iphone 5 (had iphone 4s something)..."
"I am very tech savy (working it) or so I believed. Plug iphone 4s : backup ALL. write down the date. Try to restore on 4s: date is good. Ok lets do it. "
"Plug iphone 5: yes new phone. Yes with restore from today's backup. Yay this is easy. WRONG !!!"
"Nothing restored... Wtf? Weird. Ok I'll plug back the old one... NO this is NOT a new phone. Sync in progress HUH ? STOP WTF ?? I am scared now..."
"Long story short : lost 3/4 of contacts and half of 100's pictures. My wife's contacts are 8th world marvel: with pictures and almost all data fields filled. I somehow fucked up ... O m g fml."
"When you plug a new phone you better, beforehand, find the backup storage in your files somewhere  \user\appdata AND copy it elsewhere BECAUSE IT WILL BE REPLACED (WTF??) BY NOTHING with the first AUTOsync 2 seconds when you plug your new phone. W T F ??? /facepalm"
"She now owns Galaxy 5s rooted and everything. I just got myself lg 4G. "
"Fuck itunes. Fuck apple."
"ITunes was so bad 8 YEARS ago that I haven't bought an apple product since the 2nd Gen iPod Touch. I can't imagine how irritated I'd be if I'd had to use iTunes all these years.Is there software that can do the same thing while also working with my iPod classic? Tons of managers can work with the Ipod classic.  Although I believe that was the cutoff when they started encrypting the file system, so you need to download Itunes and extract a couple background processes (applemobiledevice and appleapplicationsupport) and install those independently.  The only way for software to communicate with an Apple device is through Apple's processes.  The Itunes installer exe can be opened in an extraction program like 7zip to get at the individually bundled installers."
"I use Winamp to manage mine.There was a program called MediaMonkey a long time ago that was pretty good, but I have no idea what the status of that project is now. It was pretty big back in the day.I use Media Monkey. It's still going. I use it to sync music to my AndroidI listen to classical music a lot, and I relied heavily on a Genre->Artist->Album sort, where I used the composer as the artist and put the performer in the album name. I know there's a Composer metadata tag, but its support is too spotty to rely on."
"Now, when I click Classical it's just a pile of 80 albums, many of which are from box sets and are impossible to navigate without the artist breakdown."
"I use Ecoute now and it's basically just the old iOS Music app. There's another called Cesium that's made by a redditor who is using the proceeds to fund a vacation with his kids, but I hate to say that it has far too many performance issues to be usable right now. Takes a solid 20 seconds to load my album list.The sorting is a mess. "
"In iTunes I have albums sorted by artist->year, because that's how the discography makes sense. But I listen to most of my music on my Apple TV, which is hooked to my nice speakers. "
"When I share my library to it, it sorts it by artist->album alphabetically, no matter what. I've actually went and numbered the albums 01, 02, etc chronologically in the sort name thing, which works, but what bullshit that I have to do that. I'd like to know why I have to use an app designed to manage media to manage my telephone."
"It'd be nice if there was a decent app designed specifically for phone related management tasks that worked reliably."
"It's kind of like buying a Windows phone and using CD Player to take backups and install updates.Can I just add that the Music app on the iPhone is also turning to garbage? I can't sort my music the way I want to now, I can't go to the song currently playing and look at the rest of the songs on the album, and don't get me started on Apple Music."
"Why isn't Apple Music its own app? Since the iPhone was released, the Music app was for music on your phone. But Apple Music is now so tightly integrated in the music app I can't even search my own music without having to close the apple music listings first. It's ridiculous."
"Edit: Okay so apparently a lot of my complaints about the app are actually just because they've changed it so much I don't know how to use it anymore, but thanks to you guys I'm slowly learning how to use my Music app again!It's terrible! They ruined it!A-fucking-men!"
"I'm so pissed that Apple is now succumbing to giving us interrupt-ware to push their shitty software."
"It started for me with gamecenter and now it's apple music."
"I should've shorted them when the slide is usability started."
"> I can't go to the song currently playing and look at the rest of the songs on the album,"
"It took me a few months, but I finally figured it out yesterday, if you are playing a song and tap the icon with the 3 dots at the bottom right then tap the album cover that pops up and it will show the rest of the album"
"I fucking hate it, especially considering I used to know how to use the app and they purposefully made it worse"
"but at least I figured this out> It took me a few months, but I finally figured it out yesterday,"
"That's generally a sign of bad designYou guys are making Windows Media player sound attractive.yeah i wish they'd just left the music app alone. it was good enough. now if i want to play music i have to make sure to turn the internet off first or wait 30 seconds or more for it to connect to apple music. and they changed the display so i have to jump between options just to find all of my albums that used to be displayed all togetheriTunes just keeps getting worse and worse and when they killed the iPod classic I was very sad."
"Edit the classic was perfect it had a small screen so it wouldn't break, a huge capacity, and and a battery that lasted for hours. I don't want apps I want all my musicThey should Bring it back. Like mini or classic size with ssds.  Make them funky colors like always. But like 500gb+ maybe even 1tb. Which raises the question of what the hell are they doing to it? It's a 15 year old product. By now it should have perfected it's purpose: playing, purchasing and managing media on your pc and devices.>Which raises the question of what the hell are they doing to it?"
"Loading it up with so much crap to enforce DRM. There's really no reason any iDevice shouldn't be plugged into a computer and be usable like a USB Drive... but they, for some fucking reason or another, thought iTunes should manage AND enforce all that.If i remember correctly doesn't apple use some kind of weird storage method creating a fuckton of drive partitions, which would make it awkward to use in regular file managers.More like just a fuck ton of folders and files inside those based on some criteria.  Then, on top of that, each folder and file has a random shortened name.  The actual names and meta data (names, artist, id3 tags,  album art, lyrics, etc) are then stored inside a database file, that if it gets corrupted, makes all of your music disappear while still taking up storage.  "
"Its fucking absurd.  Why not just optimize for lossless and store the files in a computer readable file system? after years of organising and curating my collection, the shitness of iTunes is what pushed me to Spotify. "
"Can't go back now.And the irony of all of this is that the zune software was damn near perfection from day one, and only got better, and yet...and yet, to this day, no one trust Microsoft with anything other than the main OS, and XBOX. "
"I blame IE6.People love to shit on the zune, but it was really an amazing piece of hardware with some damn good softwareI'm still using it right now. I don't think that I will ever switch. Even have the 270 mb installer backed up for a rainy day.Same, I have it backed up I. Like 4 places just In case I lose one of them. Now if only I can add music to my zune on linux..."
"Edit: in* not I.They are trying to push that fucking Apple Music bullshit on the phone and iTunes. Nothing better than getting a goddamn full screen ad every couple of weeks when I open up the music app. There also used to be helpful categories neatly arranged for all songs, artists, genre, etc. Now there's music and three other tabs that take me to some shit where they ask for money or to connect to something and follow people. All the base menus are now buried in a labyrinth of sub-menus. The heart feature next to songs doesn't add it to a favourites playlist like every other music app or service. In fact, I still have no fucking idea what it does."
"And it's the same shit for iTunes for some reason. It used to have a sidebar menu that had everything the user wanted to interact with. It acted as homebase. One patch later, they hid it by default but still had the option to bring it back. Another patch after that, they just got rid of it altogether... sort of. The sidebar is there when in playlist mode, but vanishes in any other mode. In fact, much of the UI emerges/disappears/repositions based on what submenu you choose. It's as if they wanted to build the most unfriendly user design possible. They succeeded. It's the worst thing EVER. EVER.Like so many products, instead of doing one thing well, they began to make compromises to make it do a lot of things with mediocrity.But my bedside lamp has a clock *Built-In*!  It can receive texts and take pictures too."
"I mean sure, I can't figure out which menu the light function is in.Never half-ass two things, whole-ass one thing."
"-Ron Swanson"
"They could learn a lot from that man. I know I have.I tried turning off Apple Music, iTunes Store, iTunes ~~Match~~ Metadata-destroyer, everything I could that wasn't plain local music management. And it still manages to piss me off every time I open it. Apple Music is also very poorly organized. very poorly is an understatement. Apple Music is completely useless. I used it for 6 months and I'm going to be honest those were the worst 6 months of my life up to this point. When I cancelled Apple Music I had to completely restore my phone because it fucked everything up so bad. There are too many complaints to name them all, but the one that grinded my gears the most was the fact that for some reason, Apple changed a shit ton of my uncensored songs to the censored versions. None of my Apple Music songs got changed, only the ones I had before Apple Music. It wouldn't let me use the uncensored version from my computer so I was forced to download the same song I already had from Apple Music. I'm convinced they did this intentionally to force me only to use Apple Music songs. Fuckers "
"/endrantI'm with you on the conspiracy. iTunes used to (it doesn't seem to anymore) delete songs at random that I didn't buy on iTunes. This includes music *that I made myself* (I'm a musician). I ended up having to make special backups of songs that were hard to find because of this. So frustrating. I highly suggest Google Play Music. I once used iTunes."
"Back in -05 or so, I had a weak moment and bought an iPod. It required iTunes to get the songs on it, so I installed iTunes and pointed it to my music library. "
"This library was the result of many, many months ripping my CD's, arranging it in a carefully thought out folder structure with metadata added and edited to perfection."
"After iTunes was done with it, I was left with a flat folder structure full of useless garbled file names."
"Haven't touched a Apple device since, and won't ever.I'm a little surprised you didn't massacre the entire Apple campus.OH FUCK DONT GET ME STARTED on what itunes did to my meta tags holy shitWaaay back when I had an iPod, I had received Muse's newest album as a gift. Slapped that sucker in the CD tray, set itunes to rip. It gets confused and goes all hey, is this The Resistance by Muse or The Resistance by Muse?"
"I picked the wrong one, because all my song names from the album are in Japanese now."
"IPod went through the wash, it didn't make it. Itunes went through the control panel, it didn't make it either."
"This was the original reason I switched to Android way back in like 2009 or something. Plug the phone into the computer, copy music folders over like a USB drive, open them in my phone's Winamp app, done. This is all I've ever known. What is using iTunes all about?iTunes is about giving into your overlord and hoping that in its benevolence, it will give you that which you desire. Trying to rise up against it and manage your music manually will be dealt with swiftly and brutally.Plug iPhone/iPod into computer, does nothing. Install iTunes. iTunes recognizes iDevice, syncs playlists. Last time I used an iPod (things might have changed since), there wasn't even drag and drop through iTunes. You make playlists, and it will sync those playlists to your phone/pod. Plugging it into another computer (one without those playlists on it) will basically wipe your iPhone/iPod and sync it up with the new computer. This might leave it completely blank."
"--If anybody has more recent, relevant information, let me know.--You have to add music to itunes, then sync it to your iPhone. No way to get music from you phone to itunes or to another person's computer (without wiping your entire library/ sketchy 3rd party tools). Same for videos, except 9/10 times you have to convert it in iTunes before it syncs to your phone."
"photos is similar but a bit different."
"Having a real file manager (and now Google Fi) is what's keeping me with Android phones.I hate how it's impossible to drag a photo into another app. I always need to first drag it on the desktop, then in the app, then delete the photo. Why? Because poop.Apple in their ultimate wisdom decided that there shall be absolutely zero filesystem exposure on the iPhone.  By itself, I don't think this is neccesarily a bad design choice.  What you get instead is essentially a database of music, pictures, apps, contacts, etc.  Naturally there is a filesystem that the operating system uses (and apps each get a private directory they can use for storage as well) but none of this is presented to the user."
"When you want to transfer files from your computer to your iPhone, you need to use a program that will update the database as well as transfer your files over.  This program is iTunes.  A few years after the iPod's inception, Apple started encrypting the database in an attempt to prevent others from implementing an alternative to iTunes.  I don't know what it's like now, but this is what we end users like to call, a dick move, and it allowed Apple to be really lazy on iTunes development since they essentially were the gatekeepers between your 2000's PC with a sweet Napster/Kazaa/Bittorrent music library and their shiny portable."
"The biggest probem with iTunes (in my most humble oppinion) is the fact that you need it in the first place.  Ideally, Apple could have followed the exact same arcitecture and provided a basic API to developers on desktop platforms instead of actively trying to lock it down through security by obscurity.  Had they done this instead, you would have a choice of which program to use to sync your iPhone.  People could happily use iTunes when they want, but could also use more minimalistic software if iTunes is too much."
"Speaking of too much, when you look up software bloat in a dictionary, the picture you will see next to it is a screenshot of iTunes running on windows.  The program is like a dumpster that Apple keeps trying to shovel features into, and it's just a massive pain in the ass when it can do all these useless things, but will outright refuse to do certain things just because Apple doesn't want you to.  For instance iTunes limits your ability to make backups in certain situations.  I don't remember the exact details, but it's something like you can't mix libraries.  If you want to sync music to your phone from your brother's itunes, you need to delete all your music on your phone first.  <edit> It's my computer.  You will copy the damn file where I tell you to, or your memory is getting deallocated! </edit> "
"This is just an oppinion / review from my experiences.  I'm not trying to sell or short anything.>[I don't know what it's like now, but this is what we end users like to call, a dick move, and it allowed Apple to be really lazy on iTunes development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c-d720OvH8)"
"Reminded me of that scene in R&M."
">Ideally, Apple could have followed the exact same arcitecture and provided a basic API to developers on desktop platforms instead of actively trying to lock it down through security by obscurity."
"I think you give Apple too much credit. Locking you into iTunes was never about security, it was about control - something Jobs was famous for being obsessed with in terms of controlling the user experience."
"It was also the path to additional monetization from artists / content producers and distributors as well as placating legal entities that were concerned about piracy.Pain. Suffering. Garden variety sodomy. "
"You want to copy some shit over to your phone? Cool brah go ahead and import it to me. K. Now plug in your phone and let's do this. OMG YOUR PHONE IS SYNCD TO ANOTHER COMPUTER!!!!!! I WILL NOT SYNC ANYTHING TO IT UNLESS I DELETE EVERYTHING FROM IT FIRST, K? K????"
"Yeah. It's dumb. This is literally THE reason I never bought an Apple product in my life. Way back in like 2006 I had the displeasure of trying to use iTunes to upload music onto a gifted iPod shuffle. It was so incredibly painful, poorly automated, RAM hogging and bloody unintuitive. If managing music was such a brainsore, why the hell would I invest in that ecosystem? "
"Never looked back. To this day I get viscerally angry if I find QuickTime or Bonjour installed on my computer.Dude that's nothing. One time I plugged my phone in cause I wanted to put the audio book I purchased on it (fuck me right?)"
"ITunes decide to install every single app I had ever downloaded in my 9 years of owning an iPhone. "
"It installed like 1000 apps. And since I obviously didn't have space for that. They were just icons and didn't work. "
"I had to manually delete them. "
"It took days. "
"I'll never plug my phone in again. I'll just buy the fucking audio book twice. > I'll never plug my phone in again. I'll just buy the fucking audio book twice."
"This was the plan alllllllllll along. *evil laugh*I just don't understand how this is not a dealbreaker for most people. I'm not trying to undermine Apple, the iPhone is a great piece of tech and its role in the development of the smartphone cannot be denied, but this proprietary software is just impractical. "
"I basically use my android device like a USB, copying into it all sorts of media (music, movies, pdf docs, ppt slides, etc) for viewing directly on my phone and sometime for transferring using standard 'copy and paste' procedure. I can't imagine dealing with the iPhone's limitations. It absolutely was a deal breaker for me. 10 years ago. Using an iPod with a PC and a sizeable music collection  was a pain. Copy everything manually and then using a 3rd party program to build the internal library. "
"I really miss this about android."
"The people in r/jailbreak kept telling me : oh, it's nothing to get a tweak to do that. "
"You mean a $15 tweak that barely works? For something android has done natively since ground zero? And spend more money on tweaks to get a sub part android experience when i could just sell the iPhone to some poor idiot, and get an android? "
"Why the hell am i using an iPhone?? I miss Google keyboard. I miss folders. I miss being able to download shit directly to my sd card or my phone memory. I miss having an sd card. I miss setting up my home screen apps in shapes. /rant Also, I'm going to keep copies of every file you've ever imported. No it's not actually there but I'm showing you the file name because I thought you might like to look through the stuff you used to have mixed over with what you currently have. Don't think about it too much. Thinking will only cause you pain.I've used non-Apple phones ever since my first cellphone, and recently my workplace game me an iPhone 6 to use for work.  I seriously thought I was doing something wrong with iTunes, like I was fucking the importing/syncing up somehow since I had never used an iPhone before."
"I couldn't believe that it seriously worked like that.ITunes is becoming as much of a joke as Internet Explorer. Yeah, fuck you, if you make a simple thing like transferring legally-purchased music files from my PC library to my mobile device a tyrannical exercise in rage-inducing restrictions and limitations, then I'm jailbreaking it, pirating everything, and you can go fuck yourself. Hell, I'll even *donate* if possible to the artists I want to support and get tickets to their shows (of which many receive a much larger cut than they do for their tracks/albums) with my savings because (1) I want to anyway, but also because (2) *fuck* you.even if you jailbreak it now there is no way to access the device as a usb stick and copy the files from your pc to the phone."
"you still have to find a way to transfer them to the phones internal storage but since apple has used a unique file identifier for all imported music from itunes (read a piece of shit) this means even those .mp3 files will not show up in your music library like they would on android."
"you have to manually use a file manager tool. browse to the file location and then open it that way. its sooooooo frustrating and the main reason I sold all my apple devices and i will never buy another. I've found my peopleI'm not a big Apple person, but even just getting photos and video off my wife's Ipad is a fucking nightmare. Holy Jesus. Why is it so hard to have all the photos and videos in ONE FOLDER that you can just copy to a real PC and then delete off the Ipad... WTF. I never understood the Apple just is more intuitive thing. I never argue with those people though as they won't listen to you ever lol.I'm a pretty techy person and I just thought I was stupid not understanding Apple's system of moving files on and off my iPhone. I kept thinking.. why can't I just transfer files from/to it?? I guess I'm not the only one.It dates back to the earliest days of the iPod. The only way Steve + Apple could get the record labels to sign on was to put restrictions like this into place. Otherwise the iPod could be used to make illegal copies of music (plug into machine A, sync, plug into machine B, sync, and now machine B has new songs)"
"It's like they had never heard of the USB stick."
"I hate how they decide there's a better way to do things and take away the ability to do it the way you're used to. Like, in Preview, they took away the ability to switch to the hand tool because you can do those functions with multi-touch. Fuck you. I like using a mouse. And not that stupid magic mouse that feels like holding a fucking playing card. You can hold option-space bar to use the hand tool, but that's a bitch when I'm zoomed in on a wiring schematic and tracing wires all over the place. > but that's a bitch when I'm zoomed in on a wiring schematic and tracing wires all over the place. "
"There's your problem. You're using software to get things done. Don't you know you're just supposed to marvel in silence at that sweet cross-platform integration of the user interface? /sI remember when Steve Jobs said something like people want devices that just work. They seem to have forgotten that. The user experience is really more and more painful with every update. Instead of making software that conforms to me, they're making software that I have to conform to. They've really lost the plot.It funny because it's now easier to use a PC for many of the things it was easier to use a mac for in the pastBack in '96 I had my first Web job at a 100% Mac shop. I had never been a Mac fan but knew them inside and out. I even started to believe the standard fiction that they were more user-friendly than PCs."
"Then I tried to customize the system sounds on a brand new Windows 95 PC I had purchased. I was looking around to find out where Windows kept the system sounds thinking it must be like the Mac where, if you wanted to change your standard system beep sound you had to first find the sound on the web, convert it to a Mac-compatible file, find the system file in the system folder on your Mac, put the sound file there and then you could go into your control panel and change the sound."
"My girlfriend at the time was more used to PCs than me and she said, Just click 'Browse...' from the control panel and choose the file wherever it is."
"..."
"WAT?"
"That was ridiculously, hilariously easy compared to the Mac.>  Instead of making software that conforms to me, they're making software that I have to conform to. "
"Well, this is a very personal point of view. "
"Welcome to my position on Apple though, I've ALWAYS felt their it just works moto needed to be It just works only if you do it the way we want. I've always felt Apple required me to conform to their way of doing things, though likely a good chunk of people didn't need to change much.I've always said apple products are good for those who don't know how to use computers. But if you do, then their software  is awful. Want options for that? Sorry, no options for that. To be fair, I feel like Apple always made products that users had to conform to, to some degree."
"Android is all about customization. Apple gives few options, but (traditionally) made those few options work better and more reliably than the alternatives. That doesn't seem to be the case any longer.Steve Jobs also said plenty of things like You are holding it wrong, 7'' tablets should come with sandpaper, so users can file down their fingers, If you see a stylus or a task manager, 'they blew it', 'no one's going to buy' a big phone, and did not believe users wanted high-resolution phones or shoot video with their camera phone, or even use third party apps. He was also firmly against Blu-Ray because he said you could watch 1080p videos online."
"Apple has always wanted their users to conform to their products and not the other way around, even during Steve Jobs time.I am a long-time Unix user who happily moved from Linux to Mac OS X quite some time ago.   I have not seen the stability problems mentioned in the article, but I definitely think the usability of Mac OS X and iOS has peaked and has been getting noticeably worse over the last couple years."
"Unintuitive applications and features along with obscure UX is increasingly bad.  As someone with decades of experience and a computer science degree, I have a fighting chance to work out how to make the device do what I want.  Trying to explain it to my parents is a lost cause."
"To me, it seems like Apple has too many UX people, all tasked with making improvements.  The net effect is 'change for the sake of change'.   My parents knew how to search on their early iPhones.  Now, it's slide down on the screen and it will show a search input.  WTF?  It's not intuitive, and there are dozens of examples of more of this."
"The merging of iOS concepts into Mac apps is also a disaster.   Photos is garbage.  Change for the sake of change.  It doesn't work well as a desktop app."
"I actually dumped OS X 10.11 for Linux on my macbook because they broke one too many Unix features, and HFS+ and the scheduler are still terrible.Which Unix features did they break? I haven't run into any issues with my workflow. I've brought this up a few times, but I'm curious: as someone who clearly pays attention to UI/UX, how do you feel about hard pressing a solid piece of glass?UX person here: it's terrible but we've run out of other gestures. Hard press violates the basic concept of affordability. You have no idea if something has two press states and no idea what will happen when you do. It's basically worse than right clicking. "
"But amazing once you know it's there.Out of curiosity, what is it that makes right clicking bad?Often that you don't know if it works, there is no indicator what it will result in where and how."
"Many programs now standardise on pop-up menus showing only the currently needed things, but all features are still available through the menu bar."
"But not all software is like this, there is still software where the right click is used for menus not otherwise reachable, or for non-standard actions. You never know in advance.> Change for the sake of change."
"100%. I paid 5k for a customized 17 MacBook with exactly the features that I needed for editing movies and music but so many of those features have been discarded by updates and replaced with garbage that it's no longer the computer that I bought."
"Not to mention having to pull my motherboard and cook it in the oven because they got cheap on Chinese solder."
"And the company is completely unresponsive no matter how much you complain.F-F-F-F-Five thousand dollars????Honestly I don't know how prices like this aren't enough to turn people off Apple, let alone the other fuckery. Sounds like a job for a desktop.$5,000 macbook = $800 desktop, I'd imagine.Ditto: bought a Macbook Pro and the update to Yosemite killed my Final Cut Pro X and OnOne software. Now my 2008 Mac Pro is once again my primary workhorse computer (was able to revert from Yosemite back to Mavericks with TimeMachine) and the laptop is more of a TV. I grew to hate all Apple software updates, especially for the iPhone where it seems you ONLY get functions you don't really need or want and LOSE the things you do use. I left iPhone and went Android and love it. My old iPhone 4s is still kicking, and still asks every time I use it if I want to update to iOS 9 or whatever they're on... there is no way to permanently tell it no, and updating it would surely kill it. Seriously, if there were another alternative to PC or Apple I'd be checking it out, I'm over the whole thing; come on google, design a computer that can run a version of Adobe software!! Don't do that, there are plenty of companies out there that will reflow it affordably. As long as it isn't an underlying heat issue causing the solder joints to break (cough, HP laptops and Xbox 360), a proper reflow should hold for a long time. Quite a bit longer than throwing it in a kitchen oven.Hey send me a link. I see the guys on ebay that supposedly fix macbook mobo's but I don't know to trust them (I worry that they're just throwing it in the oven like I do lol.)"
"It is, however, an underlying heat issue. It gets up over 250deg on a regular basis with all the graphic work I do. "
"I *did* stop playing MMO's on it and that helped a little.Sounds like you need to invest in a new computer.The only new computer for me will be one I build myself. I'm done with the crap being sold to consumers today."
"Funny thing: I have a powerbook 5300ce that still works perfectly -except the battery- (6k when new) *and* I still have a top-of-the-line blue/white G3 desktop that still works perfectly (400 *solid* MHz of processing excellence!)"
"I can't remember when I bought the Powerbook but the G3 was from '99 so that gives you an idea of how low Apple's hardware standards are today. Most of my cars don't last as long as my original macs."
"Unfortunately technology/processing speed has passed these things by but I do still use them (just not for YouTube or Java.)Why would any customer, and one of Apple to boot, have to put up with treating their motherboard like a take-and-bake pizza?Why can't I group face time yet? What does Apple use internally when they need to have a video conference? "
"[deleted]Skype?It would also be nice if Apple could make a Windows client (and maybe even Android) for FaceTime. It's not nearly as useful as it could be if every device could run it. As it is, you have to remember whether the person you want to call has an Apple device or not. same with imessage but that's one of the only things keeping a lot of people I know with ios. Apparently, I'm that guy who's texts show up in blue or green or whatever.This and the facetime thing are the dumbest pro iphone arguments. Like, they're pretty solid pieces of hardware, but god dammit it's annoying that half of their social apps are locked down and incompatible with the majority of the handset market.Probably WebEx or some shit. Please wait for your conference to begin! Too Dee dooo de dooo diii ......Ding ding ding! That what we used when I worked there. It's pretty much what any large company uses.Hangouts?Fuck dude even fb messenger or skype at least work relatively platform-agnostic. "
"The worst fucking thing about facetime is my ~~friends~~ acquaintances with iphones act like they've never heard of another video chat app and like *I'm* the pain in the ass for not being able to use that proprietary locked down bullshit, rather than, you know, literally any other video chat service. "
"Skype used to be a verb ffs.Remember when Facetime was supposed to be ~~open-source~~ an open standard?Until a patent troll group sued Apple, resulting in Apple having to pay royalties. I believe that adequately explains why they haven't pushed it to other platforms.If I remember rightly, they had to re-engineer it to use relay servers instead of direct communication between peers as a result of the troll suit. Damn shame really the p2p version worked way better.It was going to be until VirnetX fucked us all over by waving their patents around."
"Since apple lost that patent battle FaceTime couldn't directly negotiate device to device, all the data gets relayed through apple.  "
"Since apple is paying the data bills for FaceTime, they no longer want to open standard it for good reason. > Since apple lost that patent battle FaceTime couldn't directly negotiate device to device, all the data gets relayed through apple. "
"Well, that sucks. For multiple reasons.Yup.  Apple is going to pay out $625 million for it. "
"http://www.engadget.com/2016/02/03/apple-to-pay-virnetx-in-lawsuit/"
"[Heres a better background on the issue and why we don't have high quality direct connections for FaceTime anymore](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/08/report-after-patent-loss-apple-tweaks-facetime-and-logs-500000-complaints/)Apple is regressing back to the days of quicktime."
"Seriously though.. remember when your brand new Windows computer was filled with shit that you didn't want? That's what the iPhone is now."
"I don't understand why things are going wrong. Apple employs over 100,000 people. They can't ALL be incompetent. What the fuck is Tim Cook doing? Anyone on reddit could point out a dozen things they don't like about Apple. So why isn't anything being fixed?The thing that went wrong, was that Steve Jobs died. And instead of helping people operate independently, he was an asshole dictator."
"Maybe he intended it to be that way, for us to see the Steve Jobs years as the good years. That only he could keep Apple innovative and working."
"Man, what a brilliant egotistical asshole.Yep, as soon as Jobs died I said well, that's the end of Apple being ground-breakingly innovative. I mean, of course they weren't going to roll over and die with the creator, but a company like Apple, needs an asshat dictator like Jobs to do what it needs to do. Keep everyone in line, on their toes, and constantly be striving for success. Jobs put his public email online, answered a lot of angry messages (sometimes with his own angry replies) and he was a CEO who cared what the fuck Apple was doing."
"I'm not saying that Tim doesn't care; of course he does. But no one can care like Steve did for his baby."
"Within another decade or so, unless there is a serious shakeup at Apple (doubtful), it will basically be Microsoft, ten years ago. A stable, bland, rich powerhouse that everyone just tolerates because hasn't it been huge forever? UghThis. Which is why I'm concerned about what's going to happen to Tesla once Elon Musk passes on. He runs his companies in a similar way. Hi, I'm a computer repair guy at a small local shop. We just fix pcs and macs, not the phones. But I have to tell you, I always cringe when I see a Macbook come in for repair, because of just how god awful the experience always is."
"With PCs, there are usually easy parts that you can point to that cause issues. Hardware problems that can be diagnosed, software problems that can be resolved."
"But with Macs, there's always a process, and it's always awful. Some examples over the past month:"
"* Man wants us to upgrade to El Capitan. Seems simple enough. He doesn't have an apple id, so we need to make one for him. AppleID requires a credit card before using on the store, even for free upgrades, there's a workaround, but it doesn't seem to be working the way online tutorials state. Finally, we ask him for a credit card, and go to great lengths to explain that it won't cost him. Go to update. Download fails. No reason. Now try to click again, no error, no message, no nothing. Click again. Nothing occurs. Tried rebooting. Same symptoms. No idea what's going on. Try logging out and logging back in with apple id. Click to download, finally it starts working. Somewhat. Eventually fails without error. No reason why. After two days of trial and error, we discover that update fails over wifi for no apparent reason. Plug in ethernet, it finally works."
"* Man needs new hard drive, we install with his version of OSX, but can't get his apps off app store because apple only provides the latest edition of apps, which require the latest version of osx, and it's not in their software library. End up pirating the damn free software."
"* Man has slowness issue. All hardware diagnostics pass. Try installing new copy of OSX, it fails without error (just stops). Try new hard drive? Now won't boot off DVD. Eventually discover it's the hard drive cable. Third one this year. (How can this be such a common issue?)"
"* Attempting to install garage band for a friend. Requires newer version of OSX, but this computer doesn't support that version of OSX. Off to pirate again because APPLE makes it so impossible."
"The list goes on and on and on. Every single time I go to do a Mac repair, I know that it's going to be an endless goose chase of solutions because the real, obvious solution will never work as intended.I don't *hate* Apple software, but a lot of it feels like late beta rather than a final release.  It's not like Steve Jobs never allowed software to be shipped that wasn't feature complete or had problems (MobileMe, anyone?), but it feels like there's a lot of it these days."
"Maybe the best way to put it is that I spend more time these days looking forward to the next OS releases to fix problems rather than to add new functionality."
">Maybe the best way to put it is that I spend more time these days looking forward to the next OS releases to fix problems rather than to add new functionality."
"And so much disappointment, since updates seem to be more focused on adding features than fixing bugs. I'm still waiting for a fix to music disappearing mid-search in Spotlight, but instead we've been blessed with the new feature of being able to find music in the iTunes Store from spotlight and Siri more easily than content on our actual phones. "
"I'm ready to give up. Someone pointed out in a recent thread here that it's now possible to transfer even text message history to Android phones when switching- Sony even bundles a desktop app to do the whole thing for you. So headphone jack or not, my iPhone 7 will probably be a Sony Xperia. Didn't Steve Jobs gather the MobileMe team in an auditorium and rip into them when he found out how many problems it had?And made a public apology during one of his presentations.He was the one keeping their standards high. His replacement doesn't share the same vision he did. He probably shares the same vision, but just doesn't tear everyone around him to shreds for screwing up like Jobs did. Once Jobs was gone, the big bad wolf wasn't around to scare Apple employees into giving 120%. Maybe?He doesn't seem to share so much of the vision though. Jobs always wanted to create the most intuitive product possible, these days Apple is shitting all over many basic UX concepts. How the hell is someone supposed to know they have to slide down on the home screen to get to spotlight? How the hell am I supposed to just magically know how to use their new weird implementation of window snap on my Mac? There's 0 discoverability in these features, something Android really is doing better these days. "
"Also Cook is giving Ive too much power, and he seems a little crazy. Their new magic mouse and the Apple Pen would have NEVER been allowed to even be considered a valid prototype under Jobs. It's a joke.I just hate it when I am happy using the software how I want to use it and they keep pushing other things on me.  Like The Cloud, Mail, some stupid Apple Music thing, etc.  I am good.  Leave me alone.Uh oh. Someone is becoming an old fogey. back in my day we had windows xp for two decades and we liked it dagnabit. :-D "
"Seriously though, I've got a 27 2009 imac that's being force antiquated by the fucking updates apple keeps shoving my way. It is strictly used for photo editing, no new software in over a year and it lags so bad all because of apples BS. [deleted]How many megabits are in a dagnabit?I have iOS 9 on my 5s. When using the Music app, I expect it to show me the music I have on the device. "
"By default the app starts with My Music... It is, sort of... a list of compilations I had purchased some time in the past. I didn't upload the list to the phone on any occasion. I never accessed it on my phone. It is not stored on my phone and with a 500MB/Mo plan I will not access it online even if I could. Worse, it is an incomplete list of what I have in iTunes. I don't want this list on my phone. The screen layout has Recently added at the top using 30% of the screen, compilations containing said list I didn't create or will ever use on my phone using 50% of the app's screen, leaving me a tiny 5% sliver listing local content in queue - that or I have to go to Playlists access my local content. All I want to see is local content. "
"So, My music really isn't mine. My Music, Radio and Connect, are 75% of the options are Apple's on line clutter interfering with music I have locally. The phone incessantly nags you to log into the cloud when using locally stored content. "
"My cell plan is over 100 bucks a month favoring phone features over data. Apple's hard-on for cloud features makes the phone increasingly tedious to use. I don't need it - piss off!>I dread opening the thing."
"That sums it up for me. I f'ing hate to open itunes anymore and I always put off updates until I absolutely *have* to download it."
"I have a busted iphone 6 screen too and after I heard about getting bricked for not using the official Apple service I'm afraid to replace it myself."
"This arrogance was the cost for Apple becoming *the* go-to for consumer tech-ware. I long for the days when everybody scoffed at my nerdy Mac. Now we're all in it together.> I long for the days when everybody scoffed at my nerdy Mac."
"If you want to be a tech-hipster, come on over to /r/chromeos. People love to make fun of our devices.I am an Apple fan. Well, decidedly a bit more so in the past. A former Apple genius in full disclosure, and a lifelong Apple nerd. I was the kid defending his Apple to my friends when we played Starcraft over 32k modems. Sure, that was about the only thing I could play. Not much coming out for Apple, back in those days. Myst, maybe? Halo, almost. Well, eventually. Damn you Xbox. Anyways."
"As the PC revolution happened, I was there on the front lines with friends with competing builds hosting LAN parties. For those I'd just generally use the house machine, but still I would often, repeatedly, to detriment declare my preference for the Mac I left at home. I championed their products in and out of the home, at school, at work, and even made a professional career out of it."
"To me, they were renown for their connectivity, their simplicity, their intuitive nature and stability. Everything was right where you wanted it. They didn't crash. You could learn it quickly, though many lacked that patience early on. The hardware was reliable."
"Windows was demonstrably flaky, every time I touched one. The shelf life of PCs always seemed to lack. Every time I sat at a PC, there was some minor misplacement or malfunction that irked me, like I wanted some contextual menu that was in the wrong place, I thought, or features hidden beneath poor organization. Frequent crashes, upsets, losses of data, to me Windows seemed haunted, honestly."
"And after all, Steves' Jobs and Woz were known for using a box that let you hack the phone system. And I understood that. I was always a little suburban saboteur and I was beginning to understand the transformative power of technology. And Apple's products worked amazingly, were stable, longer lasting, powerful, and cutting edge."
"But still, I got shit for that dedication pretty much all through my education, into college, on into my technical career in IT. I'm not saying I never used PCs or never grew to like them (I'm writing this on ubuntu,) but I just always had appreciated the facility with which Apple could just make it all work."
"However, when they switched to the intel architecture away from the motorola powerPC chipset, they did lose a bit of their stability, and their performance, and shelf life, at first."
"And when Steve Jobs died they truly lost some of their primary direction. The software is losing that impeccable touch, noticeably. In spite of the new campus being constructed about a mile East of One Infinite Loop (itself an actual infinite loop this time.)"
"It seems like now we are constantly being badgered with frequent recursive iterations of update cycles to the iPods, iPads, iPhones and Macs in our lives. They seem to slow down, get heavier, get flakier. Perhaps Tim Cook at the helm doesn't seem to engender the same level of attention to detail that Apple had prior."
"So moving along to my problem. I updated my iPhone 5 to latest iOS 9.2.1, using iTunes 10 on my Mac Mini running OS 10.6.8. Now, my iPhone makes my Mac prompt me with cannot be synced because it's software is not compatible with this version of iTunes. And I can't update the version of iTunes, because 10 is the last version for 10.6. And 10.6 is the last version for my Mac."
"My Mac willfully made it so the phone that was just paired with it can no longer read it's own iTunes library?! Awesome."
"And for some reason now iPhoto won't download the pictures and videos.  So I need to individually export the data on the phone to the cloud, before I can restore the phone. "
"I echo what these guys Michael Hiltzik and Walt Mossberg are saying.  There has been a noticeable degradation of parts of the integration within the Apple interface.All of your problems are your own doing.  If you would buy the latest models of each product like you are supposed to, there would be no issues.I'm an Android and Windows user, and I hope Apple steps up its game. After all, without competition, Android and Windows will become shit. What pisses me off the most is when there has been glitches in their programs dating back to the dawn of OS X that still linger around despite all of the versions numbers they've used. Take Mail.app for example, same problems are in the iOS and OS X versions. Noting new, you know just the same old glitch that when it asks for the account password it only saves it to the incoming settings and not the outgoing. Then it creates duplicate Keychain entries that only makes the problem worse. "
"I for one prey to Jobs that Apple keeps El Capitan around for more than a year and actually take the time to fix problems as opposed to this annual upgrade cycle we've been stuck in. It's fucking madness that every year we have to put up with the burden of a new OS that always causes more harm than good to someone's computer."
"I was helping this sweet old lady (in her 90s) who has lived Macs for ever. She had a 2008 iMac and her printer broke, so we ordered up an HP ENVY 4something that I've ordered dozens of times before. A month later her iMac dies and we order a new one. It comes with El Capitan so she's jumping from 10.8 to 10.11, that's enough of a learning curve to begin with not to mention the cost of it all. Then sure enough, the printer is incompatible with the new OS. After hours on the phone with both Apple Care and HP support, they remote in and we even did a conference call between the three of us... no solution found and the engineers are working on a solution but who knows when that will be. Well fast forward to today and even with the latest public beta 10.11.4 the fucker still won't print from OS X. Of course when we were going through this initially it was past the return policy so this poor old lady is just stuck with crap upon crap. Thanks Apple! You guys really know what's best for your customers because we really need a new desktop OS every fucking year."
"Just fucking fix the shit you have now before you move on to the next big thing. "
"Obligatory, Apple Maps still sucks for me. I'd like to pick my own default map app already please. For the past 3 years or so I've seriously considered switching over to Android [If Apple do remove the headphone jack for the iPhone 7 then I will absolutely leave for Android]. Now I'm considering switching away from my macbook pro as well."
"Edit: I've gotten some awesome [Non-Apple] phone recommendations from you guys, thanks!"
"Edit 2: Since there has been some discussion about what effect the switch would have I've decided to copy paste some of that conversation to better describe *some* of my issues with the idea of switching to the lightning connector."
"Everything I say is in response to this comment:"
"> Since my other comment was downvoted, I'd like to point out that the TRS jack dates from 1878: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)"
">It is an extremely outdated and fragile design. It relies on prongs to contact the jack. The contact area is small and the prongs are easily damaged. If anything, Apple (and everyone else) spend millions every year on warranty damage to this 19th century technology."
">There are far better jacks on the market. Some prefer XLR jacks for connecting headphones. XLR jacks are much more durable and make a far better electrical contact. This is not an opinion."
">Once Apple dumps this 1878 technology, so will everyone else."
">Watch and see. I'll bet a shiny new quarter that Samsung will manufacture phones without a TRS jack by the end of 2016."
"My Response:"
"> Yeah, Well I work as a DJ, and not one of those budget laptop DJs, (Check my history if you want some verification). This means I have plenty of experience with audio equipment and various audio cable types. The TRS is perfectly fine, as long as it's not made of cheese it will hold up to plenty. I've only ever broken one and that took enough force to break pretty much any other cable type. "
">The sound quality is a non-issue when talking about this type of audio product. Hell, I can't name a professional (Let's say $2,000 and up) Mixer that doesn't use a TRS (albeit the larger 1/4^th inch ones) Maybe if we were hooking up massive club systems but this is for iPhone headphones/earphones. In fact Pioneer's upcoming flagship mixer, the DJM 900NXS2 is coming with a 1/4 AND 1/8th inch jack. (it's going to be the industry standard and priced at $2,100) The previous generation (which I use: The DJM 900 Nexus) didn't have the 1/8^th but people wanted it so they added it! "
">Here is the Current Nexus: http://www.clearviewsound.co.uk/communities/7/004/013/087/317//images/4623154125.jpg"
">Here is the Nexus 2: http://images.tonecontrol.nl/images/productimages/Pioneer-DJM-900NXS2-voorkant-schuin.jpg"
">As for XLR which you offered as an alternative... Are you kidding me? For a consumer product...???"
">[Here is an image of an XLR next to a standard TRS for anyone who wants a reference on this](http://media.guitarcenter.com/is/image/MMGS7/3.5mm-Male-TRS-to-Dual-XLR-Male-Stereo-Breakout-Y-Cable-3-m/J02163000001000-00-500x500.jpg)"
"Can you imagine that in your phone?? Apple wants to make things thinner (at this point that's pretty dumb... but whatever) not as fat as a whale!"
">No way people are putting those on phones. Try again."
">Or did you mean RCA? Well then we are still dealing with a large plug (for anyone who wants to know this is often the cable that does audio for your TV in red and white with the prongs)."
">As for dumping this technology:"
"Apple is proposing putting the audio through their current lighting connectors which experience way more issues than the TRS jacks. (Google it, I dare you). This does NOTHING other than lock people in."
"The audio is exactly the same. 100% If you don't believe me check Linus Tech Tips on youtube who are very well respected in the technology world. They talk about it as well. "
">Edit: In fact Here: (they go off on a tangent for a bit but they get back to the topic) https://youtu.be/k_tFt_X57Ik?t=28m40s  --- They do a good job of addressing my other reasons for hating this idea."
">Edited again to add some more technical info, I love talking audio Tech.Apple wouldn't be the first company to remove the headphone port. Htc had a number of phones that had an adapter that plugged into the Usb portI forget... What's HTC's market share again?hahaha very poor but this was before they flopped There just may a cause and effect at work here.i blame focus on sense and trying too hard to be like samsungFunnily enough, I went from Samsung to HTC to Motorola in search of a non shitty ui.  Stock Android ftw.It's a shame, because HTC has some nice hardware.indeed, the incredible was my favorite Evo4g was glory days. I don't think they will ever match that level of awesomenessI made the switch. Android isn't perfect but the freedom to do what I want with my damn phone keepse from even considering another apple phone. Just install Linux or Windows on your Mac if you are thinking of switching. No need to buy a new computer.Having had an iPhone since they came out, I've been frustrated with the platform for a few years, but wasn't really impressed by other options until this year. I recently switched to an LG V10, and after a week of using it, came to realize how bad my stockholm syndrome had been - even as much as I complained about iOS/iPhones. "
"I wish I would have jumped ship sooner, but I really don't think the hardware/software combos out there were up to snuff until recently. They added features at the sacrifice of stability... but the V10 makes my iPhone seem like a relic. Nexus 6p brother. This phone is amazing Nexus 6p master race checking in.  The hype surrounding this phone was real.  Best phone I've owned by a huge margin.  I really don't feel like anything has changed. iTunes has always been shit. Sometimes I think I am the only one on the planet that has actually used it to back up my iPhone. I have always dreaded opening it. "
"Safari used to be a complete memory hog, now it's actually very good, Mail hasn't changed hardly at all in the last 5 years. Preview works well for small document sizes, if you want to open a 100 page book you want Adobe software. The one thing that pissed me off the most was the rollout of iCloud. It was there, but you couldn't use it for anything really. It only took like 4 years to give you the ability to upload a file that wasn't from your phone or a Pages/Numbers document. "
"I am still very confident in the stability of the OS overall though. Between that and seamless Time Machine backups (that work very well) I am never worried about crashes and catastrophic loss of data like I am with Windows. Switched 6 years ago and still haven't ever caught a virus :)"
"Now if both companies will stop hiding ALL MY BUTTONS with every update I will be happy."
"Longtime Mac owner with a brand new Surface Pro. Thought it was just me, guess not.The biggest issue with Apple is that people still go head over heels for the new iPhone. They don't need to change how we want, because everyone else doesn't care. The rot set in with 10.7. The move to flat interfaces and grey icons just makes obvious what was happening for quite awhile. The pretty has taken over even the functional elements."
"They've killed off virtually every pro app they have and anything vaguely serious."
"The thing is, the thing that Apple was traditionally good at - the human machine interface - is really hard. I'm not sure you could reasonably do it without the kind of complete control that Apple has. And you can't have that complete control and survive unless you have really good product."
"I can't see anyone coming along and offering a similar experience. If you look at the commercial alternative - Android and Windows - the experience is so variable."
"But then, look at the history of Apple. They've had bad periods before. Mac OS 8 and 9 weren't always great. OS X took several versions to get right."
"Maybe it is all fleeting, and we should all just be grateful for the rare periods when everything comes together.It'll get buried, but [Elementary OS](https://elementary.io/) saved my life.  I sold my 2x macs when I got comfortable with it.I had original iPods, and the 3GS. After years using Windows phones and android, I managed to miss iTunes sucking so hard. Now I have a 6s and iTunes is the hardest bit of software I have to use on my pc. I feel like I'm using source tree or GitHub just trying to sync music. It's pathetic.Photos is not a replacement for iPhoto. And stop dumbing down OS X. And can we pretty please get a decent filesystem in it!I've been a user of Apple products for quite a few years now, and things really started going downhill once Jobs passed. I was expecting this. Changes for the sake of making changes, and making 'improvements' that make absolutely no sense. Great, Apple, you make your phone .00034323423 mm thinner. Good for you... I don't give a fuck. Give me better battery life. Give me a phone that doesn't bend in my pocket. Don't give me a phone cover with a battery that that looks like it was glued to the back and when I'm using it I can't plug in a pair of headphones that YOU MAKE! Don't make the new Macbook ~~Pro~~ so damn thin that it can't properly manage the thermals of the CPU and throttles to like 50% of what it should be capable of while it's sitting there idle. Don't give me one single USB type C port and expect me to make use of it for everything from managing all my peripherals, to charging the computer. Really? Getting rid of the 3.5 mm jack just because you can? How did that work out for you with thunderbolt? What? It didn't? Pushing out half-assed bug-riddled major OS updates just so that you can keep your historical release schedule. So many things that they have been doing over the last few years has bothered me, and they are losing sight of the vision Jobs had. Repeating the mistakes of the past. The guy was an ass, to be sure, but he knew what he was doing. I have an iPhone and iPad.. I have never used any Apple apps to play  music  or video. They are awful.  iTunes is a nightmare. You can't just get an MP3 onto your phone.. The rigmarole you have to go through.. Infuriating!   I ask myself daily why I don't move to android or Windows. Then I remember the hundreds of pounds I've probably spent on games and apps to get the phone working normally. And I think.. I don't want to have wasted all my money.  And then everyone else I know has an iPhone with iMessage. Gah... I'll  break away one day..and that day will be glorious. Snow Leopard felt like the last real power user OS to me."
"Since then, it's felt like all they are doing is catering to users that come from iOS. Some of which is good, I like that I can make phone calls off my PC but... They don't need to hide features like the dashboard, which they will clearly disable. Yeah. I'm real scared of where things might be headed.The people in r/jailbreak kept telling me : oh, it's nothing to get a tweak to do that. You mean a $15 tweak that barely works? For something android has done natively since ground zero? And spend more money on tweaks to get a sub part android experience when i could just sell the iPhone to some poor idiot, and get an android?"
"Why the hell am i using an iPhone?? I miss Google keyboard. I miss folders. I miss being able to download shit directly to my sd card or my phone memory. I miss having an sd card. I miss setting up my home screen apps in shapes. For me Apple took its eye off the ball when iPhones became their big money maker and they just let apple laptops and desktops slide."
"Their operating system used to have massive improvements with every iteration but lately it seems they say with this new version of OS X we added in these other cool iPhone features!.I've always run both Mac and Windows, but Apple gets some (easily fixed) things really wrong:"
"- On iPhone, after all these years and complaints, you still can't mark a text message as unread without a jailbreak.  For heaven's sake, Blackberry can do this!!  I switched to a Blackberry from iPhone 6 for this reason alone, and it runs almost all of the same apps through Android.  And, I can use Blackberry Link to use the phone through both Mac and Windows.  With my iPhone I could only use the iMessage feature on Mac.  Microsoft is now on the rebound because they concluded that walled gardens are no longer tenable.  Apple needs to figure that out as well."
"- iOS updates that ensure obsolescence by making devices painfully slow--without warning or an option to skip without constant reminders."
"- Jony Ive is a good designer, but his devotion to form exceeds that of function. His hero, Dieter Rams, had principles for good design, one of which states: Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process show respect towards the user.  How respectful to the user is it to design an object that while beautiful, is so delicate that almost everyone will have to hide it within a protective cover to prevent it from being damaged?  I think the iPhone 6 is beautiful, but it's too expensive and delicate to risk carrying around naked."
"- iTunes has sown the seeds of its own abandonment by being too restrictive and controlling.  When they were the only game in town that worked.  Back then the prospect of migrating to another media manager was scary, and that hesitancy kept many from switching (the devil you know and all that).  But as iTunes became more bloated and unstable others were making it easier to migrate and growing their content catalogs.  "
"- In the wearables category, Fitbit, Garmin and others work with both iOS and Android.  These will ultimately win the game because they don't anchor a user to a particular phone OS."
"All of these issues can be addressed, but Apple has decided that the customer is wrong.  "
"Remember the Apple ad where the runner through the hammer into the screen?  Apple has now become the screen.  I've been using apple products pretty exclusively since about 2000, and just purchased a new iMac to replace my six year old MacBook.  I'm completely underwhelmed, and echo the sentiments that iTunes, iPhoto, and Mail get worse with each new release.  I'm seriously thinking of jumping ship.  >Adobe Acrobat, the leading third-party PDF reader, handles with ease."
"All credibility lost.  I hate iTunes as much as any other Mac user (which is to say a metric fuckton).  But as crashy as Preview may be, no user in their right mind would voluntarily open Acrobat Reader unless they absolutely, positively have to.I think that was his point.  For all of Acrobat's problems, at least it runs.Foxit Reader FTW. I haven't used Acrobat in years.Why do people hate Adobe reader?"
"It's always seemed adequate to me, not amazing, not shit, but satisfactory.10.7 forward has seen a decrease in quality (10.9 was a brief interlude of slightly better quality)"
"iLife and iWork were transformed into something much worse than they started as."
"I can't go a day without my MBP having to be restarted once or twice due a VPN bug that I reported first in October 2014 that was finally closed as a duplicate of someone else's report of it, but which still has not been fixed."
"I was pointing this stuff out to Apple years ago (calling executive customer relations and reporting bugs), and I knew at the time my efforts were futile. They were futile because the iPhone is a cash cow and so they assumed they were doing everything right. I remember saying that I hope it doesn't take Apple tailspinning again to get a good foundation, but the problem is that Apple can't tailspin. They could live off their cash reserves for a long, long time."
"The change happened before Steve Jobs died. So it's either not related, or his influence at Apple was waning due to his poor health before he died. Also Bertrand Serlet left Apple around the time the quality was going down. And then Scott Forstall was ousted."
"Personally, I don't have nearly as many bugs on iOS as I do on OS X. OS X has, for me, been a hot mess since 10.7. But I have weird workflows that most people don't, so a lot of what I was noticing other  people weren't.If you don't like Apple products, the solution is actually very simple. Stop giving them your money. "
"Just stop. Buy a competing product instead. > If you don't like Apple products, the solution is actually very simple. Stop giving them your money."
"> "
"> "
"> "
"> Just stop. Buy a competing product instead. "
"This advice, it's like the people who give this advice really believe that everyone else has overlooked this simple advice and they are here to enlighten us.  "
"Also people that don't like Apple products already don't buy them. The issue is that there are lots of people that either do like apple products, or think them the best of a bad bunch, but still have problems with individual things, which of course is perfectly legitimate. The thing is, despite articles like these, many people still really love Apple products and it shows in their sales numbers, customer satisfaction numbers, and value of the company. "
"/r/technology often just lives in a bubble. Yeah I still enjoy using my MacBook Pro over any other laptop I've used. If for nothing else, then for the trackpad. Nothing competes. Oh and the battery life is amazing for a 3 year old computer."
"Obviously Apple has its issues and bad decisions, every company does. Apple seems to get a lot more attention for all of theirs, but I guess that's a consequence of being on top."
"That said, I'm about to start building my second computer which will be running Windows 10. I'm excited for that.>Obviously Apple has its issues and bad decisions, every company does. Apple seems to get a lot more attention for all of theirs, but I guess that's a consequence of being on top."
"Oh agree on that. "
"Take Google. Don't get me wrong I'm all in all very freaking happy with the direction Google is taking. But if we focus on Google+, killing Reader, YouTube design changes (especially on tablet), and Google Music I could write a full article on how Google is going downhill and get tons of pageviews.Has anyone bought an iPad Pro out of interest?That's an expensive interest.Intuitive design = drag and drop. Go Android."
"Shitty design = Apply clusterfuck of restrictions, DRM, and complicated processes to do things that should be as simple as 'drag and drop'iTunes was the singular reason that drove me to Android, and I'd never dare go back. I mean none of my other tech gear was Mac, so integrating with PC was far easier on Android, but iTunes was just too much to put up with. What baffles me is that things stop working for no apparent reason. I used to tell Siri remind me about taking out the garbage when I get home and when I got to my house I would get a notification from reminders. Now it won't work, I didn't change anything, I tried to fix it but I find myself saying the same thing and Siri creates the reminder but I'm never notified. There are many issues like this one that are just weird and seem to have no explanation.Everyone said that Steve Jobs was a huge micromanager, and that once he left the company would begin to lose its way, because he never really let anyone but him learn how to truly lead their various divisions of the company."
"Little by little, that is very clearly happening. Apple's guiding force used to be a very clear You pay out the ass for it, but what you get is the best, and over the last 3-4 years I think we've all watched that erode/blur as the leaders Jobs left behind struggle to find their own vision.Couldn't agree more with the article. The new Music app on iPhone is total shit. And for the love of god let me uninstall apps I don't use!I'd just like to say that I'm really happy I'm not the only one who thinks that Apple has consistently lowered their standards and constantly ignored the pleas from their customers to get their shit together. Sounds like everyone here has had enough, and it's refreshing to see everyone being so honest."
"The one thing I'd like to add to all the other shortcomings of Apple is their absolute reluctance to issue any press statements for any of their numerous fuckups. As a developer, Safari is a dog (and now touted to be [the next IE](http://nolanlawson.com/2015/06/30/safari-is-the-new-ie/)), but also owning a lot of Apple products, it pisses me off that Apple doesn't show face in any forums or any meetups/conferences to face the bullshit they're putting out. My only guess is that they think they're being endearing by being all secretive and spontaneous. They forgot that Jobs was the guy who could make that work. They just look like knobs."
"Anyway, yeah, I'll buy another iPhone because I still find it a lot nicer to use than Android, but my patience is wearing thin. So sad when they could really be an amazing company if they just pulled finger.My brother had a galaxy s2 and decided Samsung was awful and Android was disgusting so naturally went for apple."
"Five or six years later he is saying he hates apple and is going for Android..."
"Considering how much he hates Android it must mean that apple have fucked up his trustI haven't been satisfied with OSX since Snow Leopard, plain and simple.There is also the fact their obsession with thinness is starting to hurt their products. The bendy iPhone 6, terrible battery life, the fact they are apparently going to remove the headphone jack from future iPhones. Imagine a world where you have to spend extra for pair of headphone (because they will need to include there own built in dac and amp) you can't use on any device that doesn't have a lightening port. Any other company would call that madness Apple will call it the iPhone 7. Former Apple fanboy checking in...  can confirm. Apple software has really declined in quality. I started using Mac in 2004. I got an iBook G4 and an iPod click wheel. They were magical. They worked like a dream and the software/hardware integration worked great. So then over the years I bought an iMac,  iPad,  Apple TV, and two iPhone with much the same amazement. They were magical. Well except the last iPhone. The second iPhone is where I started to notice things were getting worse. It was an iPhone 5 I bought in late 2012. It was mostly the same as my old 3GS, it just looked a little better. I didn't think the level of innovation warranted the level of price but oh well. My iPad, iMac,  amd appleTV still worked well. Well kinda. ITunes began to be terrible and I never wanted anything to do with those apple cloud services. We got apple maps which was garbage and a bunch of native apps I never opened but that you couldn't delete. Android started to really pummel apple on terms of mobile os innovation,  and I was starting to notice I could work much better on my windows 7 pc at work,  and my functionality felt almost crippled on my iMac at home. So when it became time to buy a new phone and computer,  for the first time in 11 years I balked and decided to look at non-apple products. The it just works mantra having become long since untrue. Plus customization was almost non existent. Their native apps were garbage and an iMac in 2016 isn't vastly different from the one I bought in 2009, but the price is still around $1100 for the base model. "
"So all that said, I just built a Windows 10 PC and switched to Android last fall. Apple's software and functionality just became bad. Android isn't perfect but oh Lord the customization! I have so much more freedom. Apple was always so far behind with what they would allow. They only just allowed bitcoin apps,  3rd party keyboards and 3rd party widgets within the past year and a half or so. That and apple is super strict on allowing amazon apps to function fully (I couldn't download books directly from audible). "
"Now I've only just started using the windows pc,  but I can say that the performance I'm getting compared to the price I paid is far superior to the performance I would have gotten compared to the price I would've paid for the iMac. "
"I don't hate Mac. I'll still keep my old iMac as up to date as possible, but I don't know that all I've go back to it as my primary system now that I've seen the light. When I got my first mac,  Apple was competing against Micfosoft in a world where there was no YouTube,  no Gmail even,  no Facebook,  social media,  or Netflix streaming. Amazon was still mainly just a bookstore,  and Google just a search engine. ITunes demolished Winamp,  QuickTime was vastly superior to Windows Media Player. Office was still Microsoft's advantage, but apple had all kinds of extras and... It just worked. I think that is why many people went to Mac. Now in the age of improved Web content and 3rd party software development,  Apple's insular world just can't keep upI have a Macbook Pro I used for my DJ business.  It has a much older version of OSX on it because I refuse to upgrade.  I've heard nothing but nightmares about how this piece of software or that piece just stopped working properly after upgrading.  One of my buddies began asking for an older OSX disc so he could wipe his machine and downgrade."
"I'm now getting warnings that Chrome isn't supported in the OS version I'm running and I won't get anymore updates.  Can I play music and DJ properly?  Because that's all I give a shit about."
"Hey Apple - stop breaking shit for people that actually rely on having their machines work for business purposes.As someone who worked for Apple during and after Steve Jobs' time, and one who saw the internal degredation of internal systems, it's about damn time for Apple to actually start listening to the overwhelming feedback we're seeing from all spectrums: the press, consumers, and developers. They need to move away from the annualized OS releases (that, admittedly began under Jobs' control) and seriously give their software teams the time that it takes to truly rebuild some of their core services and applications. I know this is anecdotal but my fiancee and I used to love sharing and managing our photos with Apple's solutions (iPhoto, Aperture, etc.) but now, Photos on both iOS and OS X are damn near unusable. Not to mention, the iCloud integration being a damn mess, making it impossible to even view some of our photos on the Mac at times. It just works hasn't really applied since the end of Snow Leopard and iOS 4, arguably. "
"Edit2: Forgot to mention that their Server app is absolutely atrocious nowadays (also, arguably since Snow Leopard when it was an actual variation on the OS and not just an app as it is now). To further cement the idea that Apple has become too big and doesn't give a damn, just take a look at the reviews for their last several Server iterations; it's clear that QA has gone out the window and Apple doesn't even look at the feedback as the same issues have persisted... since 2008. People seem to love hating on Microsoft, but I'd rather support a company willing to listen to the feedback of their consumers (the blood of any business), than one that's willing to ignore simple requests made by the people who lined their wallets. "
"Edit: punctuationThey charge a premium but deliver average hardware with limited software. It seems like they are milking as much as possible. It does not bode well for their future financial reports. There is someone in the CEO seat, but he is not paying attention to who really matter: customers. Tim Cook can only think about the supply chain or his next TV show appearance. He reminds me of John Sculley or maybe Michael Spindler. That is not a good sign either.Here I am, three years into my iPhone, and I still cannot figure out the differences between iCloud drive,  Photos, iCloud photo library, iCloud photo sharing, Photo Streaming, iTunes backup, iCloud backup. What's worse, Microsoft, against which Apple always measured its software's elegance and seamlessness, has shed its old shortcomings -- its Windows 10, released last year, garnered almost universal raves."
"Windows 10 hardly received universal raves, but it was certainly received better than many of Apple's recent software projects.I hate finding posts like this so far after they get posted, when I have strong feelings on the post."
"I'm a sys admin, primarily Windows, but I do like Apple products.  I have been saying for the past year, they are slipping.  They have basically stopped updating Carplay, which is an awesome start, but could be so much more.  Then there is iOS, Apple has for the most part had smooth releases and few issues, but now more and more they are releasing problematic updates.  Things like Podcasts crash regularly.  I have been a fan of iOS because of it's stability and just working, because I don't want/have the time to tinker with my phone, I need it to work.  Well, that's going away.  Unless Apple does something, to get back on track to where they used to be, I'm losing interest.  Then there is the whole fact that they had a great thing with Siri, but now all competitors are better than it now, because they have been improving, meanwhile Siri has gotten worse if anything.  People poop on Apple, but they have always made up for maybe not the most top end hardware by delivering a consistent experience, good battery life, etc, and they are no longer delivering on that.I still have my original Mac Classic. I've got a Powermac, and two Macbook Pros."
"iTunes is, in my opinion, the worst thing Apple has ever done and it has been since the very beginning. It's worse now than it used to be, but I hated the way it did basically everything right from the get-go. I also thought that iOS was novel when it first came out, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't getting pretty tired of its shit by now. I've got an iPod and an iPad, I've also got an Android phone and tablet. With the possible exception of spending money in the app and iTunes store, basically everything I might want to do with one of my iOS devices is significantly more of a pain in my ass than it is with my Android devices."
"Full disclaimer, I'm a sysadmin and manage several networks that converge Apple, Microsoft, and Linux technologies. Over the last decade, working with Microsoft and Linux technologies has gotten easier, and working with Apple technologies on both the end-user and server level has become more and more of a pain in my ass. A perfect example is how Apple has deprecated AFP and they want everyone to use SMB. Not a problem, right? SMB has become pretty standard in basically all hybrid environments at this point because you can reliably host and connect to it on basically anything nowadays. Except on Macs, that is. Each of the major Mac OS releases for the last four years has had some horrible bug in its SMB client implementation that has made it suck. In Mountain Lion there was the share enumeration bug, in Mavericks, Yosemite, and El Capitan there are intermittent and serious performance problems as well as problems with corrupted file permissions and the goddamned Finder previewer locking files while it generates document previews and then never fucking unlocking them."
"You know what I don't need Apple? I don't need a fancy new flat design language for the OS, and I don't need you to go and make arbitrary changes to your desktop paginator. What I do need is to not have Finder lock all of the files in a goddamned directory whenever someone views it so it can generate preview images which causes me to get constant angry phone calls from 40 goddamned artists because they can't save the documents they were working on because they're in use."
"Fix the core tech and then worry about the pretty shit."
"**Whew** that got a little rantier than I had intended.Have an iPad with iOS 7. Avoided upgrading because I didn't have enough space on the iPad (Well, Apple, you are the shit fuckers that won't allow SD cards), but anyway. Finally, after probably a year I backed up all my stuff and upgraded because many apps were no longer working and I needed iOS 9 for them to do their thing. "
"Upgraded. iPad no longer connects to wi-fi. So the good news is I won't have to upgrade my iPad any more. > Apple, you are the shit fuckers that won't allow SD cards"
"That's 90% of the tech market right now. Google's line of devices included. It's impractical, but you can do [inverse tethering](http://www.howtogeek.com/214259/how-to-reverse-tether-an-iphone-or-ipad-to-your-pc-or-mac/?PageSpeed=noscript) from your PC/Mac to your phone. Okay, as someone who isn't an Apple guy, for stuff that just works I find it really doesn't."
"I had to get a screenshot off a students iPhone to use in a bullying case. First, I had to find a fucking proprietary cable. Because fuck everyone else."
"I plug it in. "
"I expect to be able to navigate to it like a thumbdrive, as the helpful notification said it was acting that way."
"No sign of the file. Nothing. Everything is locked away unless you're signed into iTunes as the same user as on the phone (apparently. I never actually succeeded in getting the file).But they are absolutely *nailing* the emoji marketThey seem to make the UX worse and worse with several of their apps (Music app on the iPhone for one). Instead of spending that time on useless changes that only serve to confuse users, they could add desired functionality (being able to edit song information on the phone, for one thing?) But nope.I don't experience the bugs in the article, but I've had numerous hardware failures (some out of the box), and some apps are mangled messes. "
"Photos? Is *every* photo in Ive's library geotagged and date stamped? Cause if it is he can go through my scanned and slide converted photos and tag every single one of them! He can then explain why the library file is near double that of the raw imports. Nikon and Picasa don't need 85% more space."
"Messages is also a synchronized mess. You know that I saw the message on the laptop less than a meter from the phone. Tag read and deleted - why do I need both (it isn't encryption, as the message tag could be leveraged independently)."
"Mail and Calendar on Exchange... Hopeless. And one of the problems with enterprise adoption."
"Contacts is a look-and-feel nightmare. Did someone see FileMaker Pro in 2005 and think 'good enough'? Provide a means to see groups within contacts, and provide some default actions. Enter a phone number that's registered to iCloud? Tag it iPhone instead of 'other'. Or better, let me set the defaults without having to fight the system."
"Lastly, I'd love to run iOS apps on the Mac. But don't brain-damage OS X to do it. Just let me access a simple emulation like Xcode without the overhead for *any* app. Absolutely true. And then there's the hard to repair hardware, glued-in batteries and banning us from rolling back to previous IOS versions. As top comment said, fuck iTunes.  Been a vile piece of software I've been forced to use on occasion.   Sometimes you can't avoid it.I own Android, my kid owns an iPad.  ITUNES is the most furiously frustrating piece of SW that I have ever used.  It is so unbelievably bad, it is like thinking of infinity.  It blows my mind.  ITUNES is the ONLY reason why I will never buy Apple.  Period.What used to be simple and intuitive has become a complex mess of gunk that constantly attempts to steer you to Apple pay services such as iCloud and Apple Music.  iTunes has always been horrific but after iOS 8 the music player app became nearly as bad.  "
"After being a iPod and iPhone lover for many years - my 6s will likely be traded for Android.  Sorry Apple - ditch your finance and marketing guys and go back to what you used to do best.ITunes is why I refuse to use any apple tech garbage >  Raise your hand if you have a folder on your iPhone full of native Apple apps you never use ... yup, that's a lot of you, Engadget's Nathan Ingraham wrote last week."
"I have this same folder and it's labeled [Meh](http://imgur.com/sUjNhPc).Apple lost me when they stopped producing machines that could be easily upgraded using industry-standard parts.  I sent feedback to them countless times, suggesting they build a machine about the size and form of a mini tower like the Quadra 700 again, but of course they never did anything like that because of their absolute obsession with iDevices."
"The desktop ain't dead, guys.  This is what I need and want:"
"http://apple-history.com/700I went to buy a trackpad yesterday."
"PS110. more than 1/4 the cost of the Mac Mini I was buying. "
"What. On. Earth. If I wasn't tied into to the eco system I'd leave because I find Apple software crashing far more than it ever used to, on new machines. "
"Ahh, but this one vibrates. Er. There's a completely useless feature.iTunes has never been good at any point in history, but I'm glad Apple users have caught up to 2001.Tim Cook isn't an entrepreneur. He's an operator.  A money man.  Cool enough guy and all, but he's not the crazy maker Apple needs.  They've simply lost their culture.  Products don't just work anymore.  It's just money now. R.I.P. Steve Jobs."
"I don't know why anyone is surprised. The same thing happened to Apple when Steve Jobs left the first time. Quality went way down. Innovation went away. Usability became a non-focus. This is what happens when you let business people, not innovators, run a company.> It's doubtful that Apple's millions of devoted users, locked into its interoperable ecosystem of Macs, iPhones, and iPads, will think about abandoning the company any time soon. "
"* I'm building my first PC since 2007."
"* I'm looking at Android phones for my next upgrade."
"* I'll probably add a new battery and SSD to my iPod Classic and stay just about that deep into the Apple ecosystem."
"I'm tired. I'm tired of bloated software. I'm tired of things taking longer than they should. I am tired of them switching all their services over to a monthly payment system. Want to back up your info? Pay us. Want us to catalogue your music and store that in the cloud too? Pay us again. Want to listen to the radio on your Mac? Pay us again. I'm over Software as a Subscription. I'm over Apple's politics. I'm over the proprietary nature of everything. I can't replace my own RAM now? I can't replace my own HDD (or SSD) which WILL fail eventually? How much does Apple charge to do that? $600 because you have to replace the whole logic board. Eff that. "
"I got this far in the article and stopped: There always have been two great virtues in Apple's policy of keeping the development of hardware and core software in-house: their seamless integration with each other and their quality."
"Apples hardware and Operating Systems are nicely engineered, and always have been, but their applications, particularly their media software, are steaming piles of garbage, and have been for probably two decades at this point."
"Attempting to manage devices with ITunes has always made me want to stab myself in the ear with a pencil, and I think that Quicktime gave me PTSD back in the mid-90s.SysAdmin here, I consult with a talent agency, Windows environment. Now they have gone through the decision to upgrade everyone to iMacs, which I thought was ridiculous at first. But imo Macs are super easy to manage way less issues and troubleshooting with them. And just one Mac mini as an OS X server installed is quite amazing. But iTunes is horrible and I don't know anyone who uses photos app. And the Windows infrastructure we built will be useless now. "
"TLDR Macs are ok for certain applications, and iTunes should have stuck with the early versions of iTunes. And don't use photos appOS X and iOS are still great for meThis is why the only Apple product I own is the phone provided by work."
"I've always thought everything about them was about as back-asswards and user friendly as a kitchen knife that doesn't have a handle. Sure, it'll get the job done, but you'll wish you used something else--even though they really marketed the hell out of that kitchen knife and got you to pay 3x the price of a normal knife because it has a nifty little Apple logo that looks really pretty when the blood starts to pool in it.I like the simplicity of a common hardware/OS platform, but I started to delay OSX upgrades due to bugs and new features I didn't want let alone use. I'm now 2 versions behind current (10.9 Mavericks) and will not be updating OS nor buying new Macs any time soon. My main mac is a 6 year old iMac with i7 processors and recently upgraded SSD and 3Tb hard drive that will see it good for another several years.  iPhones and iPads are not being updated past iOS 7 for performance and feck-iCloud reasons.I agree with a lot of the things said here, but as a converter from android, I don't see what Android does better. They also have tons of stability and security updates, then release a whole new OS a year later with a ton of problems, apps that work without tweeks are far and wide in between. "
"But I do agree that apple's integrated apps are terrible. I used to love iCloud photos, now it just freezes all the time, same with iTunes. :/Apple is really falling apart. There is an annoying bug that started in iOS9 with the bluetooth. Some cars, like the MyLink in Chevy's and the Mercedes systems, that when the phone is connected to the car it forces all audio through bluetooth. So if you open up fb, it changes the radio from XM to Bluetooth etc. Apple has acknowledged he issue is on their end and they would have a fix. That was 9 months ago.I'm a long time Apple user (MacBook/iphone), however I cannot stand iTunes and iPhoto. "
"I no longer update iOS on my phones after having the wifi on my 4 and 5S permanently disabled by updates in the past. So many customers complained about these bugs at the time but Apple did nothing. "
"I hope they get their shit together soon and allow me to restore confidence in their products again. I called this out a year ago and Reddit Apple fanboys totally down voted me when I said those in the know are moving off Apple.   "
"Right now those in the know are migrating away because at one point,  Apple was the premium but now are just becoming a Samsung clone.  And the corresponding responses are people who haven't figured that out yet, or legitimately people satisfied with the Apple tech universes.  It takes a while before you see the slide down, but I'll be watching this number as they squeeze as much as they can out of it before people catch on.  Most my die hard tech friends are already migrating. You had one Jobs...iPhoto - fucking iPhoto! There was a while, back maybe, 2006 - 2008 where my wife and I were exclusively using Macs. It started off nice, enjoyed the first iPhone a lot and all the movies and pictures we would take of our children would sync into iPhoto - great! Or so I thought... ."
"Flash forward towards the end of 2008, iPhoto started to disappoint me. Became hard to organize things, having to import/export to iMovie was a joke, plus at the time, there was no working cloud option(for a mac - don't get me started on how shitty MobileMe was) and I was terrified that I'd loose all of our family photos/movies in a house fire. Seriously, if our house burned down, the only material things I'd care about loosing would be those. "
"Anyway, Google started offering huge amounts of cloud storage so I thought - great backup option! Now to get all my stuff into the cloud.... nope. First of all, my wife and I had separate iPhoto libraries - do you think we could merge those? Nope. Do you think you could easily export or sync with any cloud based solution? Nope. And worst, oh worst of all, AFTER I'd finally said 'fuck it' to our Macs, I found out that the 'mov' format Apple imported my camera's videos wasn't the ubiquitous QuickTime format (which is itself shifty) but some weird-ass-only-playable-in-iPhoto bullshit. Rendering several years of movies taken of our two young daughters completely inaccessible on a PC (or anywhere else) without reencoding every. Single. One. "
"To this day, all my wife's family use iPhones and they are constantly battling with how to access their own media. I have given up trying to help them. For a company that was so forward thinking during the first decade of this century, they have completely lost the plot.You are now banned from /r/appleMmmm, yes...yes....let the hate flow through you...Some of you are not old enough to remember when Internet Explorer died.  It literally dominated the browser world.  After being crown the king, what do you do?  You stop innovating.  You get complacent with your product.  What happens?  Well companies like Firefox kicks you to number 2 and then Chome comes out and kicks you to number 3.  Shoot, even firefox is making the same mistakes.  "
"Apple, I was a big fan of your products.  If you don't reinvent yourself by the time iPhone 7 comes out, you will rapidly lose users.  Oh one more thing, don't remove the 3.5mm headphone port.  That's not innovation.  Blackberry is a more recent example Dumped Apple years ago. Hated iTunes and the concept of a middleman between my phone and PC. Android is life. Plug your phone into your PC and it acts like a flash drive with its own folder. Boom. Win. Fuck you Apple and your shitty iTunes.Batteries you can't change easily..  have to get things repaired by their technicians..  non-standard charger cables..  expensive...  all made in China in a company that needs a suicide net. Fashion victim fanboys and girls..."
"I don't own anything made by Apple and I don't want to.I still haven't updated to the latest OS (still running Mavericks) because of the display issues Yosemite has. Until that's fixed I'll continue to use Mavericks. "
"I also had to stop using Mail because it just stopped working. "
"That said, I'm not planning to move on any time soon. There are too many things about Mac OS I still like. I'm on  El Capitan and it's the smoothest running OS I've had on my 2010 MacBook Pro. Mavericks was a disaster. I couldn't shut down my laptop without holding the power button, so it literally took days to install new updates on it in the hopes that I could shut the thing down like normal. Plus the entire OS was laggy as shit. Not a good combination for a junior in college with a writing-intensive major.El cap fixed a lot of display issues for meI admit, didn't read article, just wanted to say this:"
"#Remember BlackBerry?this needs more attention, and Apple fans should help this get more attention. it benefits us for Apple to do better. I was an Apple fan for years, but have begun to slowly replace my equipment already, I have always been a gamer but nothing Apple offered was suitable, so I saved for awhile and built a gaming desktop with Windows 10 as my new main computer. And in the times I've been using it I feel the experience is just a little bit smoother than my Mac, which is felt especially in the past few months had been getting sluggish. I was at the point where reinstalling the OS would've been my third time in the two years is owned it, something id never had to do in the four years before I'd been on a MBP. "
"And don't even get me started on fucking Home Sharing. I have a huge media collection and want to bounce it everywhere in my house, and apple seems intent to offer me that option provided I sacrifice them a goat or something to keep the spirits happy. I deserted for Android about 18 months ago after a couple of iPhones and an iPad. At upgrade-time the salesperson kept pushing me back toward Apple just because You already have Apple devices and you want it all to work together. I bought a phone and tablet (and an iPod for the kid) - don't recall selling my soul to them for the rest of my life. "
"I still use the iPad for some music-related things but it's kind of shit that I have moved apps that keep crashing from my tablet to my (Android) phone and the phone handles them perfectly smoothly. It was easier for me to switch knowing I still had the iPad and wasn't losing money on apps I'd bought and still used. "
"Once I changed to Android, I wished I'd done it so much earlier. I'd always hated the look of it for some reason, without realising the billions of options there are for changing that. Customisation is nice but things like expandable storage and basic reliability are much bigger reasons to switch. Apple devices treat you like you must be a complete moron who can't be trusted with your own devices - and you pay extra for the privilege. That alone should be enough. Who wants to pay to be treated with contempt?> expandable storage and basic reliability are much bigger reasons to switch."
"The expandable storage isn't a panacea because so much software out there will not move to external storage, including just about any Google app that shipped with the device.  "
"I've got an LG tablet that came with 8Gb built in memory and I've added a 64Gb SD card to it (ironically enough, I got it for free when I bought my iPhone6).  I've moved everything that I can over to the SD card and yet I still had the one and only first game that I've ever tried to install on it complain that it can't update the game data due to storage.  "
"It's like these Android developers learned nothing from the bad old days of DOS.  All that extra storage doesn't actually function intuitively or with any elegance or like normal storage should."
"Also, as this is my second Android device, the first being an HTC phone that I used for two years before getting the iPhone6s, I can say with great conviction that Android is not more stable, is not as refined and is only as functional as iOS.  But scrolling isn't as good, the display glitches out, stalls, and otherwise feels more fragile than any iOS device I've ever used.  "
"It works but it's still not quite there in refinement or UX, and don't get too attached to any nifty feature your device might have because these various hardware companies have complete ADHD and love putting one-off gadgets in their device that won't be supported by either them or Android in perhaps just one or two updates."
"In both cases, with the HTC and the iPhone, they both seem to be better at all the PDA type stuff and apps than they are as actual phones.  Which, is fine I guess, because I don't like phones, I bought them mostly for the camera.At BSDcon I met two programmers that discovered code that Apple had contributed back to the BSD project that contained comments like this will fail the first time the user clicks but the user will just click againYes yes, let the hate flow through you.What's worse, Microsoft, against which Apple always measured its software's elegance and seamlessness, has shed its old shortcomings -- its **Windows 10**, released last year, garnered **almost universal raves.**"
"From this quote, I think I'll take this article with a whole bag of salt.The two big things that bother me are:"
"My phone reminding me 2-3 times a day about an update and forcing me to click a few careful options to avoid it auto updating."
"iCloud mysteriously enabling itself on my phone and Macbook randomly every now and then.I've hated itunes since the very first time I used it years ago.  "
"Was forced to use it again recently, god how I hate itunes and the 'whole package integration', no wonder Android is so popular now.Can confirm. I've been using exclusively Macs since 98. My first computer was a PowerMac G3. (OS 8)"
"That being said I've lost all faith in the brand getting any better. I'm sick and tired of iTunes requiring constant updates, and trying to be the fucking hub through which all my media defaults. It's a fucking music player, and a shitty one at that. I don't want or need it to do anything else. And I sure as hell don't want to have to use that piece of shit to sync my phone. It's a pain in the ass."
"I don't update the software on my mobile devices anymore, and haven't for years now because it fucks up the way the devices run. It's as though they use the software updates to speed up the process of engineered obsolescence. > speed up the process of engineered obsolescence"
"Duh."
"The new updates become more and more demanding, making your phone run shittier and shittier, until you stop getting updates at all (admittedly longer than the competition for the most part)"
"It's to push you out the door faster."
"Apple sure makes some fine products, but iTunes in one of the shittiest software products ever madeThank goodness for jailbreaking iphones, while I own an iphone they just get worse with every update that I end up avoiding doing any sort of updating until it's 100% required.Apple doesn't seem to let you do things without pain. Even to send contacts from a sim card to another phone (I phone) relied on iTunes or third party apps when I tried last year. "
"It's nice to not lag but when you don't have so many functions, there's a reason why it's so quick. I've been putting off my iphone's software update for two weeks, this update doesn't have a don't ask me again option so I'm going to have to hit don't download and no once a day until this garbage can be replaced.It's very nice to know I'm not alone in hating Itunes...Long time Apple user here. The Apple music update killed the ability to play my own music AND wouldnt play apple music streaming either for the first week. Considering thats the main use for my phone, straight to android. I've hated the company for about 4 years now. They really inhibit the user year experience by trying to force everyone to have the same one (I.e.customizability hasn't been in Apple's diction for a long time). This was all for the sake of providing a smooth, integrated user experience, since modular ones are ostensibly more clunky.  And now they're even failing on making smooth software? Garbage. Inexcusable garbage.Maybe....just maybe, because they're waking up to the overpriced shit Apple's producing?"
"I mean, iPen? Gimme a fucking break, will ya?Apple could have$10 a month from me for apple music but I'm sticking ng with Spotify as the app is so much easier to use and discover music imo. "
"Most apple software (apart from the operating systems) has never felt special to me. I've always found the competition just as good or better. Ironically, this is the year I chose to switch to the 6S Plus... so I don't have much to compare with except for the 4S as that was my last iPhone. It's still snappy to me - in spite to the updates - probably because I currently use it mostly for browsing or texting. "
"One thing I have noticed is that Apple's incremental upgrades seem to be getting smaller and smaller with each new model. It's like Apple is trying to see how much they can get by in order to do as little work as possible but reaping in the profits. I didn't follow the hype for the 6/6 Plus, but not a lot of people hyped about the 6S models either unless they were hardcore fans. "
"One thing I had been hoping for, in regards to iTunes, was that they'd partner up with Spotify or Pandora... let those guys handle the software. iTunes is abysmal, I've previously had issues where my iphone would sync with some books and music that didn't show up the next time because the settings I had last time defaulted. "
"As for updates.. I have always believed that it should not matter how many updates the company comes out with (in this case Apple, as opposed to Android where you have to wait for aeons to get the update to certain models and/or carrier), but those updates shouldn't be to cover bugs or glitches. It could be some kind of bullet point or something, but otherwise, it just seems like some team didn't have enough time to debug their software before they rush to another project. Not trying to make assumptions on how that company is run, but it's slightly reminiscent of some of the recent games that had been so buggy because developers want to get a product out there on time and later had to give refunds to a bunch of people for the terrible product. "
"I have many Apple products - either as a result of winning raffles or just when I bought my Macbook. I think the laptops are golden, they work really well and I know that four years from now, provided the updates don't get so crazy that I gotta start paying for them, I'll be able to use this computer and it's faster than my Windows. Cellphones? Eh, hit or miss. Sometimes I wonder if they have a backlog of features they have to work on... but it's not necessarily what the consumer wants. Haven't had much experience with iWatch but I'd love to hear people's feedback on that in relation to the article though.Itunes is now Apples primary interface with the clients hardware suite and it is simply appalling. Every new release is like.. so where's that button gone and what's it hiding as now. I use it as little as possible even though I'm sure it could do lots for me but I simply don't have the time or inclination to wade through endless trial and error trying to work out synch settings, UI changes, password change blah blah... It just works?. Oh no it doesn't!Here's a genuine question. Does anyone know how to.. and actually routinely use the cut and past on an iphone. I spend so much time getting rid of cut and paste options that I never use; they're the modern equivalent of the microsoft paper clip.If you think Apple apps run badly on Macs, try running them on PCs. Im a designer by trade and use macs at work and at home. For me mavericks is the best and I'm sticking with it. I have Yosemite on the office machine but my personal ones are mavericks. "
"I abandoned iphones (used them since day1) recently for a Moto G3, best decision I've made in years.I had an iPhone since the first one until the iPhone 4. It was amazing."
"All my childhood dreams were in my pocket, I was definitely an apple fan, but still used a PC."
"Then one day I went and play with a Galaxy s3, and was immediately hooked and never looked back. Just about the same time I bought an iMac, and that was the worst mistake I ever made in my tech life."
"What a piece of garbage. I'm waiting for the day my apartment will catch on fire just so I'll have an excuse to go back to the good old PC.Urghh, since the recent update I'm not even able to use my extra long charger anymore because it's not an official product. I have to huddle next to the plug socket with the ridiculously minuscule one Apple provides. They're becoming stupidly restrictiveAnd people still buy their products, no matter how much they mess with their costumersCan't say much about iTunes but their developer console is just sad."
"It took me hours to figure out the workflow.Well, they had a good run. They'll stay afloat for decades to come with the loyal following Jobs built up for them.I was a big fan at one point of time. Macbook (first gen macbook aluminium and an mbp 15 inch) , iPhone (1,3,4s), iPod (video and shuffle), iPad (1 and 2). I think right after the iPhone 4s I started hating apple products. It first started with the phone and the iPad. There was literally no difference between the two at one point of time. I was rather bored of the UI and just having a lot of tiles lined up over a screen. I was rather pissed off that after a big iOS update, my iPads were extremely slow and could not for the love of god, load multiple pages in safari before crashing. "
"My MBP 15 inch survived for a mere 3 years before succumbing to a GPU meltdown , after updating to Mac OS X Mavericks (I cant remember the OS name at the moment, but it was a known issue for my line of laptops). "
"I first transitioned away from the mobile line, i went over to a Samsung Galaxy S3, and absoluetly loved it. Then my laptop died and I went over to an Asus. I have never looked back, I can do so much without any restrictions without having to jailbreak my system in order to customize my systems. "
"Today the only apple product I currently use is my good old iPod Video and my really slow iPad 2. I really miss looking at an apple product and saying Wow, that's amazing or Gosh, it looks really awesome. None of their products resonate that way with me anymore (bearing the latest 12-inch macbook air ) the rest of their line up looks about the same as it did 5-6 years ago. The software experience is eye-popping and extremely fluid for about a year or two. When a big update comes, your system feels slow and dreadful---which I think is the cue from Apple to get your shit upgraded. "
"I'm running Linux on my Mac.All Apple need to do to get me to go back is add an SD card slot that I can put my standard mp3's, movies and pictures on without having to recode them and deal with fucking itunes and be able to backup my contacts, texts whatsapps etc to it. Thats it, I dont even require them to let me install apps on to it. Its bloody simple!I am an Apple fan, but they are right. The quality and reliability has slipped since Steve Jobs passed away. Even the updates to fix problems sometimes feel like they don't fix the problem, or leave you with a new one. I don't use many of their native apps. And Apple Mail on the macbook is the worst program in the world and I refuse to open my mail with it.  If I have opened it in years it was only due to clicking it by mistake."
"I do still think their products are excellent products. But they've lost ground in leading the industry and for good reason. In the cell phone market a lot of new advances are really gimmicks. Apple has done well to not follow that path. But it's feeling like they are going to fall into those traps. Happy with android and even more with Moto X. Was thinking of buying iPhone only for its excellent camera. But after reading this, no chance. itunes absolutely suck balls for uploading music onto my phone...glad I bought an AK 320."
"All I need to do is drag and dropI tried iTunes once... Apple Itunes"
"Not even once."
".jpegSo did the Apple fans finally find out how bad the software really is ?Is this the latest Apple is doomed post? I am truly not sure because there are so many of them lately.My big complaint is their support of OpenCL, a programming language which they helped develop.  The CPU version that ships with all Apple computers only runs on one core... what is the point?  And their compiler, clang, has really poor support of OpenMP.  One can always upgrade by hand.  However, it's ridiculous that there isn't support for this out-of-the-box, especially given how outrageously expensive Apple computers are.  "
"I've had colleagues complain about their shoddy OpenGL support as well.  And then I have other colleagues who use Apples for development!  I've never been able to figure it out; I think they just like the luxury factor of having a Mac, and don't have to pay for it themselves.Apple is like the soup Nazi.  The worst they treat their customers, the more the customer wants the product.Eventually even the most unobservant people realize they're getting fucked.This is their problem. They designed everything to only work one way, every process is as simple as a button press, but there is no other way to accomplish the task. In fact, they go out if their way to lock things down to prevent you from finding an alternate method. When everything works right, it's fine, but if something gets messed up or an app isnt working right, there is no work around, and there is no way to find or fix the bug. That function just doesn't exist anymore until you buy a new one, or if you're lucky, a factory reset will erase everything on the device, and MAYBE fix the problem. I can sum this up very easily.  I suggested to my son that I get him a MacBook or similar for University.  He asked if he could put Linux on it!Saw it coming....Jobs is gone again."
"However, this time, they cannot lure him back. Or it will be challenging at least.I'll probably get a lot of hate for this, but this really isn't surprising to me. I've been saying for years that there is nothing superior about iPhone in comparison to other devices. They are, simply put, glorified smartphones because Apple got out the gate first and advertised best. But when you look at them in comparison to other products, they pale in comparison on many levels. Sure, they can connect across multiple platforms, and connectivity is great, but in all honesty, I can do the same thing on my phone, PC, tablet, etc. by simply using the same Gmail (or similar program) account. The things that once made them great are now just the norm. They're nothing to write home about by any stretch, it's just a lot of bandwagonning and nostalgia, and people who are too sucked into the myth to see what is actually going on.Apple software is all about what you *can't do* now. Can't install software outside of the App Store... Can't transfer music to the devices you want... Can't properly use MVNOs with their phones..."
"I am honestly shocked that they haven't moved MacBooks to iOS at this point and forced you to jailbreak them.forget software, why the fuck can't I plug ANYTHING into my $700 ipad?  One fucking connection port. I suspect that while Steve Jobs was a jerk he really did care about the product first. Now that he's dead concern over profit, shareholders, etc. is slowly superseding the concern of making really good products.I wish they would open up MacOS X more to make hackintoshing less of a chore.  I would gladly pay for MacOS X on non-apple hardware.  I've worked in a UNIX/Linux related role for 20+ years (sysadmin, development, sre etc) and I've tried just about everything looking for a solid desktop experience and MacOS X brings me the best of both worlds (nice interface but with the power of UNIX close at hand).  Sadly though Apple hardware just isn't keeping up with my needs.  My last few desktop builds have all been hackintosh because for the money of a MacPro I can get a lot more bang for the buck that fits my needs better with much more room for expansion in the case.  My last few laptops have been from Sager for the same reason.  I can buy newer and more powerful hardware for much cheaper than an Apple device.  Hackintoshing is a pain in the ass, I don't deny that.  But at the end of the day it is my only route right now to get what I want without feeling like I'm being ripped off with overpriced hardware that doesn't really fit my need."
"With that said, MacOS X itself has declined in quality the last several releases.  They want to make it iOS like, but that isn't the reason people use it.  Keep my phone/tablet OS on those devices and keep making a great OS for the desktop.  Those two goals are not the same thing because they are ending up with a situation of doing more with less (phone/tablet) and less with more (desktop) and both end up losing.  "
"I'm also rather pissed that my iPad mini (first gen) that used to be able to do things with ease gets slower and slower with each OS update.  It takes a few minutes to render espn.com in safari on it now, and it used to load instantly as an example.This will be the reason why after a 1 year break from Samsung to let the wife go Apple we're both switching back to Samsung.  "
"I can't wait for the S7 Edge+ then 12 months later the wife gets out of her contract to sell that shitty Iphone 6+ and take the latest Samsung phone.  "
"Android has much more freedom and to be honest it's almost like a PC since i can do almost anything i could ever dream of on an Android phone with ease.But new phone, tablet, and laptop customers may be taking a closer look at alternatives, including Google Android-powered units as well as Microsoft devices, than they might have only a couple of years ago."
"This is very much me. I've been an Apple fan since those fruit-colored iMacs came out at the turn of the century, and I've pretty much owned every version of the iPhone. "
"But over the last two years, I've slowly moved everything I do on the software side to Google products (gmail, calendar, photos, etc), especially on mobile, and now I've been wondering if I shouldn't just be using a Google Nexus. I've heard people say that the iPhone is the best Google phone out there, but damned if I'm not thinking that may not be the case anymore.Apple music is just.... Broken :/I remember a time when Itunes WAS  a good software product... Oh wait.. no, I cant remember a time..  Anyone else feeling like software in general is becoming more and more half-baked and messy? It seems five years ago products had a lot less flaws than nowadays.It boils down to how the management structure of the company has changed since Jobs died. It was a terrible personality trait, but his megalomania churned out a huge number of great products with a singular vision. "
"The Tim Cook era is giving us me-too ideas and software that feels like it was designed by a committee of people that didn't have any consensus. You can feel this in Apple products as of late, and that is why people are starting to speak up. The golden era is gone, and I think people are finally realizing that Cook isn't the type of visionary leader or hardass that Apple needed to maintain that greatness. "
"Got a 3 and a half year old iphone 5 on ios7, love the damn thing, still runs like a charm and the battery is solid. But I know as soon as it does I'm jumping ship.Apple was only ever good, when it was good, because of Steve Jobs. And now Steve Jobs is dead. Totally agree with this. They've never been great at software outside of OS X, but I'm more upset that they've stopped innovating in the hardware dept, especially in their phones. How hard would it have been to come up with some new killer feature that nobody knew they wanted until they got it, like a wide-angle selfie lens or wireless charging or a week-long battery or literally ANYTHING else?!When OS X came out it was an amazing piece of software. It really set the standard for a useable and useful operating system."
"I can count on one hand the number of great pieces of software by Apple to come out for OS X since then. They've completely dropped the ball. Linux has always been great in a Linux is free if your time is worth nothing sort of way - which is to say, it's excellent, but only if you want to spend hours a month fixing a broken system."
"Windows on the other hand... I still feel like it's useless as a development platform for anything other than the slaved-in C#/.NET development crowd. But as an OS, it's just been getting better and better. I still scratch my head at how people complain about the new home screen system. The first thing I do in Linux is disable my desktop manager - the golden rule, for me, is to minimize time spent with the mouse. Windows' new UI is *perfect* for mouseless interaction. I rarely use the tiles as anything other than information panels, but I use the 'type to launch' feature (like Spotlight on OS X but better) all the time (when I'm stuck on Windows). The auto-updates need work, but frankly OS X auto updates suck as well.There designs are getting shit to for example charging the pencil, charging the mouse, the iphone battery case, the iphone camera lens that sticks out, the ios music app is shit. List goes on. I've had an iPhone for the past few years and I'm finally ready to make the leap to android. The only reason I have stayed so long was all the apps I have purchased. Honestly I have not had much problems with my iPhone but then again I don't keep it for more than 2 years but I have family who do keep their phones longer and they run like absolute crap. Same with old MacBooks and old Mac desktops at work. They are useless now and yet one of my coworker has a 10 year old PC with Windows 10 and it runs fine."
"Apple certainly has been going downhill lately. Very annoying. "
"And I say that as an apple fan for... Wow, thirteen years now.As someone who has hated apple software for years, welcome everyone!ITT: Fuck Apple, we've hated them all along!Two reasons I have not picked up an Apple device, lack of a micro-sd slot. If HTC can make their phone look visually appealing and still put in a micro-sd slot, so can apple. Its the same reason I refuse to now buy a Samsung phone."
"Second reason being, my intense hatred of itunes. I hate that bloated pos.itunes is the worst thing about using apple devices. moving to android and realizing that I could just dump mp3s on my phone as an external drive and install apps via apk downloaded from wherever I want was one of the most liberating experiences i've had with a smartphone ever and I'm **never** going back."
"people who have any sort of technical aptitude and yet still prefer apple are drinking the kool-aidThey keep trying so damn hard to reinvent the wheel and they know their rich apple fanboys will still pay the high fee just to get their hands on it. I miss the old iPods and iPhone up to the 4. They're more focused on the Apple *brand* and aesthetic than what consumers NEED Everything people have said is true about Apple. It sucks. Their music capabilities seem like a lie compared to Android. "
"I like ios education apps and their guided access though. For clients/work it's more effecient but personally android is my go to. When I want music on an ios device I use a Google app. "
"I never did understand the picture stuff.  I can never remember my iTunes account info so I gave up taking pictures with IOS unless I have then synced through a Google app. "
"The thing that pisses me off more then anything is they actively try to **stop** users from using **better** apps.  "
"Oh you want to you Google Maps? Fuck you, we're in a fight with Google so you're gonna use our shitty Apple Maps. "
"You want to make Spotify your default? FUCK YOU HERE'S A FULL PAGE AD FOR APPLE MUSIC. Using Apple products at this point is a bizarre and frustrating experience.  As a trivial example, one of the first things you have to do when setting up a new phone or computer is to declare your gender (i.e. Mr.,  Ms., etc.).  Really Apple?  Really?I just wish I could delete apps that i never use on my iphone.. I don't care about apple watch.. wtfI tried to transfer a few files to my wife's iPad the other day. Never again!Very disappointed in upgrading my macbook pro from mavericks to capitan. Safari has gotten bad enough with the most recent update that I might go back to using the battery hog Chrome. The split screen function that windows and my android phone can do well and I was excited to use seems to block using the two programs I want at random. The damn small window Apple apps Mail and Calendar won't go splitscreen together. The flat low color interface is boring too. I hate when my iphone just randomly starts playing music even when the headphones aren't in.  "
"Also,  I take the metro to work.  It has to go underground.  When I can't get to my music bc an ad for apples Streaming service can't load I want to throw my phone on the tracks.Nobody would care how bad updates are if you could just go back to before the update easily.It doesn't matter. All the bitching in this thread would make you think people aren't going to buy an unusable product, but all your fried have one, so you'll happily buy the next prove of shit that comes out...I refuse to update my iTunes and I refuse to update my iPhone 4. What a joke it has come to avoiding updates from the software developer. Very good chance I'll move to a surface pro this year. It will be the first time my personal computer hasn't been an Apple. I'm not a fan boy either. They were simply better (certainly more expensive) computers for a long time, but they've faltered in the last three or four years. I've always been a big fan of Mac OS, but it's becoming a monster. I still cant get over the fact that I cant independently change the volume on my alarm clock and my ringer. I still cant believe that my snooze time is permanently set to 9 minutes and cannot be changed. I cant believe I have to download a 3rd party keyboard to get swype functionality. Want to transfer files over bluetooth? Nope, gotta use icloud. Apple software is almost insulting to use. I can just imagine the ghost of Steve Jobs looking over my shoulder saying, well that's not how we want you to use it. I could never get past the lack of a right click on an apple mouse You aware that you can use literally any USB mouse on any OSX device, right? Yes, even magic ones that have two buttons.I wish they could make their fucking Apple TVs stream consistently.  My work outfitted every conference room with an Apple TV.  Nothing but problems.  The first half of most meetings is just trying to get connected to the fucking thing."
"Great hardware, but their software is really shitty.  I remember when iTunes didn't suck back when the original iPods were all that was around.I've been an iPhone user for 7 years. My next phone will likely not be an iPhone. I left the iPhone last year due to how terrible the local music listening experience had become.I've been an admirer of Apple *hardware* all my life.  Their displays, despite not being as good sounding in the spec sheets, somehow manage to *look* better, clearer, sharper, than my Note 4 QHD OLED screen.  Their cameras - 240fps @ 1080p, with minimal grain too?  That's simply astonishing for the price.  And their lightning connectors should have been established as the standard for *all* phones years ago, you can't improve on that."
"But because of Apple *software*, I'll never go anywhere near an Apple product in my life.The thing which really annoys me about Apple is that they refuse to release their development tools for other platforms. Even Microsoft has Visual Studio now available to use for Linux."
"While I can see from a business perspective it may seem better to only make it available to Apple products but consider for a moment the amount of developers who do not wish to use Apple products and so cannot developer apps for iOS. "
"There are many developers who would develop for iOS if it meant they didn't need to use Apple hardware and so Apple are missing the chance of having more developers creating apps for their OS. I'm not saying more developers and more apps is a good thing but having more developers creating apps increases the chance of another fantastic app being made.It's impossible for me to remove all the music from my iPhone. I double check and still somehow it leaves music on there. Any other program I could just go into the phone and see what's on there but instead I have to go through stupid fing iTunes. I haven't even had music on my iPhone (that I wanted) since streaming services were invited. So why must I use this horrible software?WTF did apple just replace iPhotos with. The new photos app looks like a work in progress, and is so non-intuitive to use.As someone who works in the field of Apple technical repairs, I agree completely.   iCloud fucking sucks, I don't use it, and I often suggest customers don't either, because its bad, buggy, and causes more problems than it solves.   Its actually easier to pull out a cable and manually sync the device through iTunes and Photos (previously iPhoto) than it is to just setup an iCloud account.   Nobody likes it.  The watch is an overpriced flop that serves very little purpose to all but the most devoted people who force it into their lives....your phone is in your pocket, you are spending $500+ to save literally 2 seconds of time to pull out your actual phone, its dumb.   The Macbook, ya know, that stupid thing with 1 shared port thats the exact same price as a Macbook Air but less than 50% as powerful?   I've seen 3 of them, total, since they came out, nobody buys them, nobody wants them, people see that and see the 13 Air right next to it and then you start to list the advantages and disadvantages of either unit and its not even a choice.   1-port, on board SSD, not upgradable, and spec wise its almost literally an iPad with a keyboard...its complete trash.  "
"As much as customers should be backing up their data, they still mostly do not, so on logic board SSD is the single stupidest idea in the history of the company.   70% or so of the inside of the Macbook is just empty space!   You're telling me you couldn't put a normal SSD stick (like the Air and Retina use) off the side with a connecting cable?!   Dumb, just dumb.   When I see someone out in the world with one of these (again, I've seen 3), I feel sorry for them and I hope they are backing up every single night.   If their video chipset dies (which Apple laptops are well known for doing), goodbye data!  "
"OSX is awful these days as well.   I hope you didn't setup iCloud, because now you'll have 500 popup messages on your screen all day long telling you to sign in!   Oh, you hit cancel because you don't wanna sign in right now?  We'll just assume you did that on accident and immediately bring the window back up to force you to hit cancel for a 2nd time to make it go away....I'm sure some of you have experienced that, and it gets worse if you setup Messages to sync with your phone, adding another double dialog cancel to your bootup routine.   When the first thing you have to do after booting your computer is hit Cancel 4 times in succession, you've done fucked up.  "
"They are still great computers and very secure (just get good anti-malware and a pop-up blocker or you'll get infected with malware pretty easily), but they are quickly declining in all aspects.Mac is still pretty solid, but I attribute that to being built on Unix over anything Apple has tried.What if a company made a product consumers wanted? That'd be a nice change.Consumers are still buyingRecord Mac and iPhone sales. Yeah, no one wants to buy that crap!You got downvoted, but you are exactly right.  Until people stop buying the new Apple shiny, they will stay on their current trajectory.  But it's not like people are stupid and are buying products they don't like. Sure, Apple software has gotten worse lately and it's not excusable whatsoever, but lots of people like Apple products and don't run into the same issues. It's not because they're brainwashed. They denied the Binding of Isaac Rebirth App... Enough is enoughMy issue with Apple is that they always limit what you can do. As someone who uses Linux where you can do about anything and seeing how you can't do really anything especially with phones unless you go through a tedious amount of things. Its annoying."
"Their latest news about 3rd party repair bricking for screen repairs etc.. is ridiculous in my opinion. "
"OH and of course the fact that I can build my own computer at least 2-3x better for the price they charge for one.Even basic system functionality sucks. Why does the Spotlight Search block the UI while it is searching for files? Don't they know they should always keep the UI alive in a separate thread so as to receive cancel requests and new key strokes even while a search is under way? Do we have to see the input box freeze for a few seconds while typing? If they can't do it properly, they should give up immediate search and only perform the search after the user hits enter, so as to keep the input box unfrozen at all times."
"They should know better. Never, ever block the UI while performing background computations. The user should always come first. In this day and age of reactive interfaces to make such a piece of crap UI is shameful.[Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/George_Santayana)"
"George Santayana"
"I've been trying to approve my devices for iCloud Keychain with a verification code for mmm... 2 years now? It still fails every time, with a generic error message or saying the code is invalid. And it pops up and reminds me to approve constantly."
"I've also replaced the guts of my macbook air with an upgraded logic board with double the ram and it still often acts like it has no ram at all.I turned my iCloud Keychain off, it turns itself back on and keeps asking me. It did it again half way through that sentence. So many of their core programs suck now. iTunes is absolutely the worst dog shit program ever. They ruined something that was so easy to use. Now I dont even know how to find anything. Stop fucking with your programs and go back to simple. Who the HELL is on the iTunes team, and why do they not know the first thing about making anything make any sense?"
"I haven't opened it in over a yearUpgrading to El Capitan destroyed my life... I want to cry.  Even the sodding name."
"Try Linux - bound to be a distro you can get on with.The best thing Apple ever made was the ipod ClassicI know this article is about software and not hardware, and that what I'm about to say is beside the point.  **But** ... As far as Apples hardware goes, I had the first two or three i-phones before switching to an Android, and I can honestly say that the biggest innovation that Apple has had since inventing the smart phone (which, don't get me wrong, was HUGE), was when they made it more like the Android, i.e. larger surface area and thinner with higher resolution.  Ever since inventing the smart phone, I feel like they've only been playing catch up with Android.  Even the highly acclaimed Apple watches came out a year or so after Samsung Gear, which no one seems to have noticed.  For some reason, everyone seems to think that Apple invented that technology.  At this point, I feel like there's no substantial difference between the i-phone and the Android, it's just a matter of personal difference.  And btw, is the peek function of the iPhone 6 taking the handheld world by storm like everyone predicted?I used to evangelize Apple products to friends and family, but I haven't done that for years now. "
"Their software has gotten awful, and iOS updates **deliberately** shorten the life of their hardware.I can't up vote this enough. Throw out all the core apps and start over. They are all complete crap now. I used to look forward to every update-now I dread them. I wish I had stayed on Mavericks. Yosemite was half baked. El Capitan doesn't sounds any better. I haven't updated to it. iTunes, Photos, Pages, etc...all....crapwear. Apple used to make the best apps on their OS. I don't see that any more. Everything is half baked. I know they can do better. I hope Cook lets them.They almost killed my phone 4s that could run for AT LEAST 2-3 more years with the iOS 9 update and they keep opressing me everyday to press the fucking 9.1 download button so I can discard my cellphone quicker and curse my phone with an even worse intentional rage-inducing lag"
"im out9.2 made my phone a lot faster, less buggy, and longer on a charge. 9.0/9.1 still felt like betas.I'm guessing you haven't tried 9.2 yet ...... runs faster than 8 on the 4S..."
"..... then again 9/9.1 ran faster than my stock nexus six (I have about 6 apps installed on it, heh)At least you have the option to update, 5 years after the phone was released. That's unheard of on the Android side. Yeah, the update notifications are annoying but if they didn't offer the update, people would be complaining that Apple was making their devices obsolete by not offering updates in the first place. please show me an android that was released in 2011 and still gets updated by the manifacturer and also runs well on the latest releaseThe point isn't that you can upgrade the handset, the issue is that you can't downgrade it once you reckon the lag is too much. It's pretty hilarious reading these complaints and fuckups by people who consider themselves tech savvy. iTunes is used by millions of people across the world. If it were seriously as terrible as everyone here is making it out to be, the situation would be a lot worse than all of you preaching to the choir. And to top it all off, you don't even need to use iTunes. You can use your iPhone completely independent of it. But since I'm a minority opinion here, I'll be downvoted so no one can see the one comment that actually makes sense. They fired Scott Forestal in 2012 and everything went to shit.A minor OSX update once messed up their own HP printer drivers (which took Apple ages to fix, with only a really bad workaround). Wasted 4 hours of my day at my parents for this. "
"That isn't as fun as the consistency of corruption they got in their iPhoto library though (which was fairly regular), or how in the new OSX they changed the way to attach images to an email (they made a separate button just for image attachments, which means that if you want to attach files instead, its now confusing). "
"The big problem IMHO though, is how Apple gained a lot of their market share. To this day, I have no idea why competitors didn't sue them for the Mac vs PC ads which suggested OSX couldn't get viruses (despite the fact OSX was commonly the first compromised target in hacking contests). I'm guessing Microsoft didn't because they probably profit a significant amount with MS Office for Mac, or still had Apple Shares, but they should have been for misleading advertising. "
"Back then, not a week went by when ProTool users weren't complaining that OSX updates broke protools either. I think people are simply becoming less forgiving of the issues these days. For me the music app on IOS stinks now. I'm so sad as I do use it constantly. At first I thought, its just me finding change hard but it really is a pile of shit. I feel like I'm stuck with it as I want it to sync with iTunes and my playlists.It's funny, I use very few of the stock Apple apps, but I'm in no way tempted by the Android side of things  (or windows phone, sorry MS, keep trying, your tablets are getting good). "
"The feel of my iPhone is fantastic, but more importantly, the best mobile software is consistently developed for the platform. (The Macbook hardware is just as good, though the app ecosystem is much more sparse on that side -- not sure I'd take my arguments too far on that side of things).  "
"The article critiques Apple apps mostly, not the foundational OS, or the hardware. The author, the other writers cited, and the 'public' aren't crazy here -- there does seem to be a problem. I tend to side with the idea that the release cycle is incompatible with solid software for them. "
"But the core OS is solid, and the hardware is fantastic. Mobile apps tend to be developed on at least iOS for a reason, and you can use a lot of that fantastic software in place of the stock apps. Very easy to do, >70% of the apps in the store are free, and the number is closer to 90% when you include freemium. The author seems to take it as a given that the only thing keeping users AND developers on the platform is the stock apps, which is insane. They're missing the reason people buy Apple products in the first place, and why the lack of 'it just works' in the software brings such a sense of disappointment to the customers. "
"The trapped in the ecosystem argument is bullshit too, but it's easy to make since it fits with the idea that Apple customers are mindless. You can't get to Apple's position by ripping people off or tricking them, and if you miss that in your analysis, you're going to get a lot of things about the company wrong. "
"Apple wouldn't be hurt by getting their shit together on the software side of things, but they'll probably have my money as long as the best 3rd part solutions are writing their software for the platform ( and I don't know a single company that's talking about STOPPING their iOS app, it's always just when it's right to get stared on Android) and as long as their hardware is exceptional. You never know though -- they've got a lot of goodwill built up over the years but any company can squander that.Wow, shit.  If anything, I think they are getting more usable for everything else."
"I'm in grad school right now and I haven't had to pay for Word, PowerPoint, or Excel.  I get by with Pages, Keynote, and Numbers just fine.  In fact, I get told that my presentations are awesome and beautiful."
"I really use Safari, Messages, Mail, and iTunes.  I don't understand the hatred for iTunes.  I like that I can remote sync my stuff over WiFi.  I like AirPlay screen sharing.  I like AirPlay to my speakers when I'm jamming.Product innovation has been replaced by innovative ways to overcharge customers. I thought you liked adapters."
"Yo, dawg, I heard you like adapters, so I made adapter for your adapters for your adapters. That'll be 150 bucks. Kthxbye asshole."
"-AppleThe biggest problem Apple has is Apple. It's like Pepsi or Coke. You have to drink the product. Give one Apple innovator a Samsung Galaxy, and he will see how MUCH BETTER it is over iPhone, that maybe he will make the iPhone better than that. Right now, after having both phones, the iPhone completely sucks balls. My iPhone 6 has the absolute worst copy/paste functionality, and I can't drop the cursor in the middle of the word for an edit. It either picks the left or right of the word. Like if I spell Newfoundland wrong, and I need to delete the d. I can't drop the cursor there. There are so many little things like this, I keep getting more frustrated with how bad it is. Plus all the apps, they are trying to own me with their shitty apps. Make a better app, sure, but the apps they force on me suck big balls. I can't read any more of this thread as I'm getting so fucking angry. I was such an apple fan, from the mid 90's until the last five years or so. I swear I'm gonna have PTSD from this thread.This article could be applied to *almost* any other company.I've disliked Apple ever since discovering in the late '80s their insatiable need to be different from Microsoft by having to press Ctrl and mouseclick to get right mousebutton features, and still not adressing this 30 years later by continuing to favor single-button mice in their product line."
"They are just not concerned with user experience, they want everyone to do things *their* way, and it saturates everything they do.I've said it a million times -- why the hell can't I drag and drop music files onto my phone in 2016? It was easier to transfer files to my goddamn Rio 500 than to my iPhone.It's been so, so painful to watch Apple change from a technology company to a fashion accessory, trendy company. "
"It's like they were waiting on Steve to buy the farm so they could finally work in peace on all the bullshit he shot down through the years."
"Unfortunately I work with software that only runs on Mac so I'm kinda bought in. Having a Hackintosh helps, though :)Once again, Linux is in position to pounce.  With Windows 10 problems and the Apple issues, if there were a couple Linux distributions to get behind, they'd be tough to beat.Unfortunately desktop Linux interest 1/10 of what it was in 2003 or so.People have been saying that about Linux for decades now. The problem Linux still has to overcome is fragmentation and end user support. There's too many cooks in the kitchen doing their own thing (see android for example and setting up exchange email on one versus another compared to iPhone). And since  company backed support with Linux for the average home end user is non-existent, people aren't going to switch to it in droves."
"Sure there are message boards, but are you really going to expect your parents/grandparents to know what to type into google and understand what they are being told to do? Googling is a skill in and of itself let alone using an OS that you are not familiar with."
"Linux's place in the market would be for those who only know how to click on the Firefox logo or open office suit. Outside of that, the average end user is going to be completely lost because Windows and OSX hold your hand for you."
"Also Ubuntu out of the box at least to me is pretty ugly. Mint looks a ton better. But part of the draw to OSX is the look out of the box. With windows, it familiarity. "
"Also you need to account for things like with what happened with flash on linux. Adobe stopped making it for Linux. Sure we should all be moving to html5, but we should also be doing a lot of other things as well. Point is, in my experience, at least in the enterprise world, you are on your own unless you know where to look.Relatively speaking I've seen a lot less issues with 10 than I have past releases. The few times I've had to support it it's been due to Nvidia mucking up drivers or some strange Bluetooth things. "
"Linux, although better every day, and being a Kali user, I still wouldn't ask my parents or grand parents to run it.Pounce?  "
"Linux is more likely to stumble into the room, look around bewildered because it forgot what it went in there for in the first place, then leave. "
"There ain't no pouncing going to be done by Linux. Apple has always been a shitty overpriced brand, dont know why people keep on buying it. IdiotsI will be downvoted for this. I don't care. I really hope this is a sign that this 15 year Apple fad is finally starting to die. Apple software has always sucked.Two weeks ago, after repeated complaints and confusion from my girlfriend, I installed Windows on her 13 Macbook Pro Retina.  She loves the computer, but OSX was destroying her soul.  She really was Apple's target customer, but after really trying to love their stuff, she just couldn't do it anymore.  BTW, it runs Windows really well.  Nicer than any Dell.I'm platform agnostic - I just want stuff that works. Since Snow Leopard, everything Apple are vomiting out into the marketplace sucks a hairy dick. And best of all? The cunts don't even fucking acknowledge the plight of tens of fucking thousands of people on their own fucking Apple forums?! Case in point? Sure thing - ask them about the wifi dropouts that plagued people since fucking ever after snow leopard - yeah that's right - it ended up being the dumb cunts updating some part of the network stack and it not working. But no - rather than fess up, they did their usual Apple aloof act. "
"Cunts."
"Take a look at the Microsoft Surface Book if you're a MacBook Air user. I did and I'm sold. Pisses on design, build quality, features AND WARRANTY in every. single. way."
"But keep on pushing out those smartwatches fellas - coz THAT is going to keep your Enterprise customers happy right? Oh wait.. You ditched OSX Server in favour of developing cool watch bands - I forgot."
"We've reached peak apple. They're failing now. Their new building is a traditional sign that a company is about to implode. Once consumer trust is blown, and even their ardent supporters are now saying fuck you, you know Apple is going down the shitter."
"TL;DR - Apple are cunts and we've reached peak Apple.iTunes - it used to be so simple and intuitive then they over thought it and tried too hard to be clever. Their UI testing team should have several geriatrics in it. Less focus on pretty and more focus on usability/intuitivenessiTunes isn't even their biggest fuck up. Just look at the outrage from the pro-editing community when they upgraded Final Cut Pro X. They switched from the more power user friendly style of multi-track editing, hotkeys and precision scrubbing, to some weird iMovie hybrid that has one continuous timeline, no multitrack, and a magnetic snapping feature.Bad launch (in 2011) aside, FCPX does what OP's article wants all of Apple's software to do - it just works. It's a different kind of NLE than what multi-track editors are used to, but the product isn't a fuck up. [One of the most widely-circulated videos](https://vimeo.com/108018156) on /r/filmmaking and related subs last year was cut on X, and the editing is what had everyone excited. If you're an editor, give it a try - you can disable the magnetic timeline at any point (but you'll probably come to appreciate it); you can create tracks where they're needed; and it has enough hotkeys that Premiere and Resolve now have options for users to import FCPX shortcuts.Final Cut Pro X is great, though."
"At least on El Capitan. Are we coming to that point where Microsoft and Apple swaps places? Because that is crazy but I don't think impossible.hm. Blogs full of hate for mac. Blogs full of hate for windows. I think people are just fucking stupid. Some things addressed in this thread:"
"Why pay all that money for a mac, everybody always asks? Macs come with amazing hardware. I think the hardware is worth every last dime. I have a $1000 dollar PC, and a $1000 dollar MBA. The MBA takes the cake every time, regardless of operating system."
"The trackpads are amazing. I never knew I could get so much joy out of using a trackpad."
"My 2014 Macbook Air is amazing. It runs OSX yosemite great, windows 10 great, and linux great. "
"iPhones are terrible. We can all agree on this. Stop buying iPhones. Now you don't have to live in the shitty little ecosystem they built for themselves. Problem solved. "
"Macs are great for graphic design, Chrome, and music production. If you're not doing those things go somewhere else."
"Android is amazing. You can do anything you want with it. Computers in general are amazing. You can do anything you want with them. And I mean anything. Learn to use Google, Morty. Break the cycle. "
"As a software developer, everyone will always complain about your software all the time. No matter what."
"I used to be a mac hate. I now understand why they're great. "
"JUST STOP FUCKING BUYING IPHONES. VOTE WITH YOUR WALLET. "
"Here's how to make your technology work for you:"
"* Use your macbook for on the go. They're small, they're fast, they're dependable. As I said also good for Design and Music, and browsing the web. "
"* Use you android as your main phone. Don't cheap out. Get a really nice one. They are 100% worth it. Any issues you find with android can be solved with a simple google search, and you're pretty much only restricted by your imagination. "
"* Use your PC as your main bitch and use Windows for playing games."
"All problems are now solved."
"I will never again participate or read any debates over company X VS company Y. Make your technology work for you and stop buying into the hype. "
"SOFTWARE HAS BUGS. DEAL WITH IT. No matter who you choose. "
"It's not about choosing one company as your god. Don't be an apple fan. Don't be a windows fan. Love your devices. Show them some respect. We have the power. "
"Downvote me I don't give a fuck I hate you all.  "
"And as a side note: can someone please explain why anyone would ever use a third party app to manage their gmail account? Why would anyone ever write software to manage emails? Just goto gmail.com wtf people. Plugins for anything you could ever want. No one is arguing the quality of the hardware.  But macs are shipping with more than just bugs.  Some core software flat out does not work."
"I cannot use Mail on my mac because it refuses to connect properly with my server.  Itunes is broken and unusable, safari is beyond primitive.Have been buying macs for a few decades at least now, and I have to say that although Tim Cook seems like a good guy, at least design-wise apple is really missing Steve Job's judgement."
"That said, apple will have to work a lot harder if they want to look as bad as Windows.Enjoy that form over function.You just implied that Windows had more functionality than OSX.... a Unix based OS. Have you tried piping to SSH in Windows? What do you want to pipe to SSH?  Do you want to pipe it to a Windows based SSH client or a cmd line based SSH client?  You can have either, or you can use the powershell scripting language to do all that and more, including the package manager built into the new Windows.  "
"Oh you just want a Unix style shell?  Sure we got hundreds of them, what kind do you want?  By the way, you're in a Unix based OS right?  Go ahead and recompile your kernel.  Or just replace your default shell with csh or ksh.  "
"Oh you can't really do any of that can you.  It's almost like you're in a bullshit Unix hack OS..  Hmm..  "
"Tim Cook is a piece of shit who is damaging the company, unlike Satya who is helping MS.  Apple needs a better CEO.wow amazing that anyone would be paying attention to this lazy article. Walt Mossberg was already late to this complain-train party 2 weeks ago, but this guy just copies Walt's article....Will there be a day where that creepy group of Apple users will stop defending them no matter what happens? There are not groups like this for any other company.  When Samsung fucks up, I say it. I still love the phone.  But until they go back to a removable SD card and battery they can go fuck themselves. Those people exist for Google/Android and Microsoft/Windows too. I've been subbed to /r/android and /r/windowsphone. It's as much evangelism and criticism as the Apple subreddits.I've seen much Nexus Is The Perfect Phone on that subreddit. I just really want an SD slot and a removable battery.Get an LG V10. Your getting down voted but you speak the truth. Fuck Samsung for getting rid of the SD card and removable battery.> There are not groups like this for any other company."
"Apple may have the most ardent fans, but it happens with other companies as well. Just look at videogame companies. If you get invested in a particular console or publisher, you'll tend to look past their faults.> Will there be a day where that creepy group of Apple users will stop defending them no matter what happens?"
"You must not frequent /r/apple, then.  While full of many self-professed Apple enthusiasts, it's also full of people who won't hesitate to criticize Apple at the drop of a hat *because* they're self-professed Apple enthusiasts.I love iCloud Photo Library and Safari rivals Chrome, but I just wish iOS Mail supported push Gmail...No joke, Safari crashed when I clicked to open these comments. (It's been crashing a lot in El Capitan... haven't figured out why yet, used to be pretty darn solid.)Could be your memory going out. Bad memory can cause a lot of weird crashing issues. More likely this: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7261705?start=0&tstart=0Strange bug, but could also be related to memory management. I've always hated IOS. OSX sucks because Apple has been slowly restricting the modifications you can make to your own device."
"Maybe I'll use Antergos in the future...My main gripes are with Photos and iTunes/Apple Music. Such horrible limited or obscured UIs. Without forgetting iCloud calendar.  Seriously considering if I ditch the iPhone and rMBP for Android and Windows when it comes time to replace. As an Apple Fan, I wish they never made a phone and focused on computers. Getting rid of secure erase was dumb, too. Switched from my MB Air about a year and a half ago now. Just couldn't deal with it anymore. The nail in the coffin was trying to dual boot to Linux and not working. The computer wouldn't wake from sleep correctly, the screen would pixelate at weird times. I spent weeks working with customer care before they finally just told me dual boot wouldn't be an option."
"Each upgrade made the computer worse. Customization is severely limited (especially for what is touted as open source). I finally caved and switched to the SP3. At least with MS, I know to expect what I get.I'm late to the party, but how has nobody mentioned Final Cut Pro 7. It was great, everyone loved it, and then they released Final Cut Pro X, and shit hit the fan. Now Adobe has taken over with Avid, Blackmagic and others fighting for market share too. They're learning[deleted]> 2012's Snow Leopard"
"You either want: 2009's if referring to SL, or Mountain Lion if referring to the thing released in 2012.The new disk utility seems especially crippled as well, leaving most of its functions to terminal commands. They have always, in my opinion, have had good hardware.  the pc software sucks."
"It is hard for me to leave since I do have apps that I use on a regular basis and I don't want to buy them again for android....  but I am starting to consider it.The only big problems I see are with iTunes ever since Apple Music was released. It's not exactly buggy, it is just a bad user interface. So I cancelled my Apple Music subscription and restarted Spotify. Now iTunes is just there for music I own, Spotify is for the rest.So they've arrived at the point BYoD admins started at.My NAS has mp3fs so iTunes sees all my flacs and other high quality audio formats as mp3s, iTunes syncs the selected 'fake mp3' music from my mp3fs which is pointed to my real nas music folder and then syncs them to my phone (but my server is just live converting to MP3 behind the scenes) "
"That's how I got my phone to not bother me about my formats [etc] in iTunes."
"My iPhone plays the music, and my phone can dial/sms people. That's all I need it for right now. "
"Plex and Owncloud have external protected access enabled so if there's any new music I haven't synced on I just stream it from my place to wherever the phone and I are. Or movies I guess. It doesn't matter how 'amazing' the hardware is if the software can't keep up. Good thing their marketing us better than both. (And the hardware is obviously pretty good.)I've owned every single iPhone since the iPhone 2, but the 6S will most likely be my last.  It actually does have to do with the quality of Apple's internal apps, but not one mentioned in this article:"
"iOS Update.  I liked it better when you never got notices about it.  Now, it notifies you and doesn't stop annoying you until you finally upgrade.  I will never buy another iPhone if this ridiculousness isn't removed.I own one Apple product - an iPad. It will be my last Apple product.Yeah, but Steve Jobs was a dick. Derp!I don't think its anything new that people don't like their software and services but like their hardwareAs some one who Owen a ipad but then bought a shield 3 mouths later.  The software has gone down hill rember the original home screen be for they updated  it was professional now it looks childish,  make me look at any realy cheap android tablet/phone be for bying a PS400 tablet that is locked down so much that you carnt change the icons to look direct Can someone tell me what's wrong with iTunes? ELI5, please. It's doing everything I need it to do. What should it be doing that it isn't and I should care about? "
"I do want a simpler and straightforward way of taking my pics and vids out of my iPhone and iPad but can never do so. "
"I also want to delete pics and vids from my phone and iPad without it deleting from iCloud but nooooooooooo. Sexytime pics don't need to be on my phone all the time. It's a very large bloated program at this point, moreso if you are a windows user. "
"IMO iTunes is fine for OSX. I've only ever owned iPods, and all in all they've been good to me.    Otherwise, I've always considered the brand gimmicky, over priced, under powered, and generally pretty ugly.  It's just my opinion, but there has pretty much always been a better alternative to any apple product I considered buying.  iTunes has been getting steadily worse since forever, to the point where I actually hate installing it on my computer to put more music on my iPod.I had all of their products for years. switching away from their crap, completely sick of itI bought an Macpro 3 years ago .. For one reason garage band and the rest of the apps or stuff on it ... Don't really use it.... I surf in my other PC!the software is far more stable, its just more people using it and therefore finding more bugs. Pretty sure Apple software has been in decline since System 7.  So this is kind of old news."
"They did get very good at making good hardware products, but the software has never been very good since way back when."
"I got rid of all my last Apple product 5 years ago, and I'm sure glad that I made that decision. "
"Over-priced and over-rated."
"The iPod is the only product Apple ever made that I absolutely adore, its too bad that it was phased out, and its too bad that iTunes had to ruin the experience. My iPod still works great, and I actually like iTunes... But I'd never buy any other products from them! The weird thing is that I have an iPhone 6 running iOS 9.0.2 and a Macbook Pro 15in 2011 with El Capitan. I have no quarrels with the software, especially iTunes. I am not saying I love them either, but just because I do not use, for example, Notes, doesn't mean I hate it. I don't use Windows. Does it mean I hate it? No. I just do not prefer it. "
"That said, some of the hardware is stupid. Has anyone seen the new MightyMouse or their new comedic iPhone case? Well Apple software on windows was never great, but it was always good on Macs... it's starrrrrttttttting to go south. I blame Tim and Jony, they've gone mad with power.OpenGL in El Capitan is pretty much rubbish.  I can understand why it's not likely a priority with Apple since practically nobody uses their hardware professionally outside of video and two-dimensional applications.  Still, it's frustrating that if you wanted to or, as I currently do, need to, that you get the one-two punch of AMD which has dodgy drivers on every platform and then Apple's lack of experience or possibly interest in professional 3D."
"My only complaint with my iPhone6s is that since running the very first IOS update its iPod functionality with my car's headunit has been completely inconsistent and dodgy and half the time seemingly broken.The 5S was the first iphone I got when it first came out. I miss being able to use my phone to pretty much do everything a pc does. And just plug an usb into it and manage all its storage. And make hotspots. I used Windows until 7/8 released, then converted to apple and now I'm back with win 10. "
"In my opinion, Apple did have the edge but they have built the os too much like iOS and lost a lot of functionality by favouring ease of use. I've been using Preview daily since 2010 across 2 Macbook Pros and 2 iMacs, from Snow Leopard up through El Capitan, and it has not crashed once for me. I hate imessage. Why? Because it's slow here, and especially when you're sending images from camera roll. They seem to send the high quality, so it takes longggg to get them sent. Yup, I'm not a fanboy either way, just bloody thankful I jumped to android last year. By the end iTunes managed to piss me off just by opening it. I hated iTunes so much I switched to Android when the note 2 came out. I am back to Apple now but now use Spotify and never open iTunes. I also never transfer media to my phone so it's all streaming or cloud. I fly a lot but I just read during flights instead of listening to music or watching movies.I've dreaded iTunes for years. What's new?Just came here to say fuck the music app. The show all files in Finder is about my breaking point with Mavericks. who would have thought that all it took to get fans to hate Apple would be years of mistreatment and bad products?Apple Music and iTunes Match collectively destroyed my iTunes library so moved completely to Spotify. Photos on Mac is a disaster and Preview crashes whenever it loads a document over 100 pages for me.My last phone was an iPhone 4s that I loved until the one update that slowed it to a turtles pace. I was sure they did it so people like me would upgrade to a newer device so I bought a galaxy s6 about a year ago and vowed to never buy a apple product again. But one big thing apple phones did that galaxy doesn't is have a great touch screen. Somehow the 4s always seemed to know when my finger was pressing it. With the galaxy s6 everything can press the screen, from falling on my stomach to a metal keyring or my headphone cable. That in itself has made me nearly switch back to the iPhone but they seem to be slipping as a company since Jobs passed and the damn update still pisses me off. Apple user for 10+ years now on android. I have heard that many people say Apple products are for very creative people. I disagree, I would rather say it was developed by the creative guys initially who lost track of where they were heading. "
"Overpriced: Is this phone is for wealthy ? We have several competitors (ex: Mi) who are able to design and cough up an Android phone, well tested providing better h/w specs and features at lowered price ? Its no longer new technology to be priced. So basically what you pay is not what you get as off today!"
"Experiment for you to try: Login to Skype or hangouts in an apple device and on android device. Ask someone to call you, nheot a single time do I get a call on iPhone/iPad .... Note notifications are turned on both devices. "
"Adaptors/accessories: Why don't the make standards compatible hardware ? Lightning cable huh? "
"iTunes: Not really transparent or user friendly."
"These are not the only reasons, I could come up with a list of hundred others if I had sufficient time to do this today."
"Maybe if they open source their iOS / MAC OS code and lower the costs, it may be a game changer for them.iTunes? Haves you seen Logic Audio? I'm a musician / producer and sometimes I have to use Logic because my clients work with that. How could they mess it up so much is beyond me. Very powerful piece of software that looks and feels like a Fischer Price toy with those ugly big colours and faux cutting edge UI. A piece of software that has to hold your hand every step of the way and effectively get in the way of creative workflow. They basically took a magnificent DAW and regressed it to a glorified instance of Garage Band. WHY?As someone with decades of experience and a lifelong Apple nerd.I've had ever iPhone since they came out and a few iPads. It's still magic to me when my photos share between devices. I think the software is cool. I might be a casual but I'd guess 90% other users are the same as me. "
"Windows vista on my horrible laptop turned me to apple many years ago. I had all of them. The imac, iphone, ipod, ipad, macbook pro. The restraints, the apps and updates getting hungrier and hungrier and the lack of innovation turned my away. "
"The breaking point was when they stopped all my chargers working because they werent official apple chargers and filled my phone with so many updates that I couldnt fit music and the phone software together."
"Couldnt be happier with my samsung phone and my surface pro 3. Freedom and the ability to do what I want with my devices is huge. When my iPod dies and my wife buys me a new one and I can't sync up to iTunes because it needs to be updated. Fuck that. I went to update it and it said the OS needed to be updated, I went to update the OS and the computer couldn't handle the newest update. My entire library was on that computer at the time.I agreed with Mossbergs report.  App,e software has become less reliable and more buggy.  The real turd is the Apple Watch OS.  Everytime a Watch App updates it never works properly.  The icon doesn't fill in or the app just plain doesn't work on the phone.  So I have go in and uninstall and reinstall every Watch app manually.  The real Apple shitshow is Xcode. Apple is the only company that makes you fear its updates.I loved the on-the-go playlist feature, it's a shame they killed it.Why don't people use a third party software instead of iTunes? Just scrolled through a ton of complaints about iTunes but people can just use programs like itools, it's just drag and drop. I use it for my ipod touch 1g on 4.1.2 and my iPhone 4s on 9.2..  Unless they purchase music though iTunes? But even then you can just copy them from the iTunes folder? I Moved from a HTC One M8 to an iphone 6s, the software was much more stable to begin with, having more issues now some times touch ID does werid things or fires up the passcode screen then gets stuck there for a while, last night i was playing a game and the screen just became entirely unresponcive to input. "
"The other day Siri wouldnt Hear me it was like the mic was turned off."
"All this is normally sorted with a reboot Password missing - I have not been able to use mail properly as it keeps screwing up. It absolutely was a disaster back in like 2006 I had original iPods, and the update process.My biggest gripe with Apple right now is that since iOS 9 you aren't allowed to sync apps from your Iwhatever to your computer. it's because several bugs and freezes that people complain over and over again and they never get solved.Even working out which of my podcasts is downloaded and which is synced to my iPod is a massive pain in the ass. Looking for a decent android mp3 player.I updated my iTunes to work with my new iPhone, and the app store stopped working. The Genius Bar couldn't fix it without a full reinstall. I couldn't update at all without completely and manually moving all of my stuff. "
"That wasn't the dealbreaker. Yet. I let it sit for quite a while."
"When the time came that work required I downloaded Powerpoint, I couldn't install it on my stuck outdated operating system. "
"My solution: get Windows. "
"Granted I'd used Windows a bit before, like a crappy gaming rig my aunt gave me and some work through my school, but I'd been using Apple since OS9 and had the original iPod. I was a self-identified Apple user. "
"Was.I think I'm going to buy one last iPod touch when I can afford one - and that's it. I'm out of the game. I can't afford to keep on repairing devices that break because of faulty charging ports, etc, or worry about my devices being obsoleted by mandatory updates. And yeah, iTunes never really worked properly for me and still doesn't display all my apps.I don't see what everyone is complaining about. They took their great minds and created a new software......known as Apple pencil. "
"This was the moment I lost a lot of respect for them. "
"They have lost focus. Jobs focus was to bring great products. Now it's all about bottom line and how much of something they sold. As much hate Jobs got, he had shit locked down at Apple design wise. Like the fucking apple pencil charging position would never have made it past him.I am a regular user of iTunes and really can't complain at all. Can someone explain what the issues *specifically* are with it?"
"I am a podcast producer and find it fine to browse and listen to episodes, I like the feature they introduced that automatically deletes episodes that are listened to so they don't clog up space. It could handle episode artwork a little better (i.e. if none specified, default to the podcast artwork rather than the grey placeholder) but I have no other complaints."
"For listening to music, I love the album view, it's bright and colourful and I love the up next feature to queue up a track without interrupting the playback of an album. I subscribe to iTunes Match which syncs all my music not bought from iTunes with free store purchases in the music store, that seems to work fine although it doesn't give me much feedback the music has successfully been matched. Again, apart from that I'm happy."
"The app is always responsive on my 2015 Mac Book Pro 15 Retina. Are the issues referring to the Windows version? I'm completely at a loss as to what people's complaints are!Android Raster Race.It's really a joke that Apple even tries to defend this. Dealing with the fact their newest iOS can't even mark all emails as read without babysitting it is beyond pathetic for any one of the many very talented programmers that work for Apple. They have been quite a disorganized company for quite a while now, and it doesn't seem to be getting better anytime soon. iTunes is the reason why I ditched my iPhone 4. I quite liked the phone itself, but absolutely hated the reliance on iTunes and AppleID."
"It's ok though, I'm locked out of my own iPhone 4 because it asks me for my AppleID and then tells me I'm using the wrong one. lolwut.iTunes was always absolute garbage. I had one of the first iPods, iTunes is why I never bought another piece of Apple hardware again.Apple people finally starting to pick up on things many of us saw years ago."
"IMO the biggest trick apple played on people was creating an environment where you needed to be an apple person with all your devices being made from them.  I've seen several friends IRL who WANT to move to Android but feel they can't because the rest of their devices are Apple and won't play nice.  I'm basically stuck now.  "
"Granted not everyone wants to build their own PC or have a phone that is totally open and customizable, some people need it to just work^(tm).  But one you get anchored into software like iTunes that seeks to dictate your content across all devices... bad times lie ahead.Apple needs to adopt a rule for their development teams: Any software that isn't core needs to be able to be turned off or swapped out for 3rd party apps. Icon deleted, uninstalled, no nags or special offers."
"This would keep them honest. iTunes might actually improve if it had to earn its way instead of being a default. Safari is their best bundled Mac app and it's no accident it is also the most easily avoided.This is hardly new. Anybody remember FTFF?"
"It took them three full versions until Aperture was absolutely top notch only to lose interest two years later and have it killed and replaced by a tool that is barely on par with freeware apps out there. I needed to replace my MacBook which is about 8 years old. So I started doing research on Laptops and ended up buying a Dell. Mac OS is a great operating system but I am not going to spend 1500-3000 on an Apple laptop that I am never going to be able to update the hardware.At this point I don't even *consider* upgrading my OS X to the newest version until at least 6 months after release, and often simply won't upgrade it at all unless a piece of software demands it, despite the free price tag. It can take forever for them to finally get a release working, whether it's OS X, iOS, or a regular piece of software, and the mantra with Apple software has quickly become don't upgrade unless you really need to. My current apple product. (Iphone 6) is my last apple product. The reason I always liked my iphone was because it was intuitive and always worked. Now I have constant problems with reliability and ease of use. Say, does anybody know how to (easily) change the names of mp3s in iTunes back to title/artist from the 4 character code that iTunes changes it to? I hate iTunes and I want to change media players."
"What's with all the iTunes hate? Ok syncing can suck and all but as just a music player I actually really like it.Paging John Hodgman...Don't have to answer to Steve= Quality suffers."
"The Cook is too happy.My mom gave me her 2011 Macbook Air. I wanted a break from Windows and thought this would be a nice stepping stone into the Unix world. Then the Air bricked itself during the upgrade to El Capitan. Now it's sitting on the floor gathering dust. Apparently, I have to reformat the entire drive, install the OS from a CD and re-install all of my software again. I can do that with Windows just fine.That and there are some major oversights these days, it seems. Take iCloud Photo Library for instance. Such promise, but limited in so many stupid ways. First, I have to sign in to the same iCloud account on all devices - no family sharing for photo libraries (or iTunes match for that matter). And then, everything syncs across devices *except face tagging*. Which is the one thing we really want to be able to casually do and synchronise. It seems to me that Apple have lost their eye for detail, certainly, over the last little while.The only Apple product I own is a Macbook. Even that I didn't buy, I won."
"I like the hardware, it's sleek and performs pretty well, but dang do I fucking hate the software!"
"I actually won one of almost every apple device at a point about 5 years ago, Ipod, Ipad, Macbook, AppleTV, Iphone etc."
"Telling that the Macbook is the only one i kept.Couldn't agree more. Im on my 2nd iPhone and it will be my last. Well, I only use itunes because of the ability to see all of the ablum covers well, but it's soooo slow and clunky. What's the best alternative for use with an ipod classic then?There are a number of iTunes replacements are there not? "
"I used one by Mozilla a few years ago, it was good. You still use this sort of thing?I don't dare update iOS anymore.  My iPod 4 has become slow and very subpar online.  I avoid iTunes like the plague, and getting files from it to my windows computer is much too difficult. I'm hating iOS with every update, if it wasn't for Jailbreak and a game I've been following for four years I would've jumped ship a long time ago.TSTO?What?HS:HoWC?Safari can't open the page... What? WTF, this is every second link tap on my iPad GODDAMNFUCKINGSAFARIHBGFCDFFGBBAAAAAAAAAA!!!!Used Macs from 2007 through 2012 or so as my primary computer. And iPhones pretty consistently, from 07 to present."
"You guys aren't digging nearly hard enough at the software failures of Apple. The merging of experience between OS X and iOS is when I knew they completely threw in the towel of giving a shit about software, but the trend started earlier:"
"Did anyone use Aperture? Or Aperture 2? Pretty great pieces of software. Aperture was awesome and worked quite well. Then they just gave up and stopped. No more aperture. "
"How about Final Cut? Any serious video editors that used to use Final Cut Pro? Does anyone remember the fiasco of Final Cut X? A whole industry refused to upgrade because the next version was ridiculously unintuitive, highly backwards incompatible, and generally: shit. I know of a few editing houses that continue to use Final Cut Pro on some older OS X versions because some several-thousand-dollar professional plugins they rely on  won't work with the new version. "
"Killing off their pro creative software was when I started to realize their software was becoming an afterthought. "
"Then when they started to care about OS X so little that they just started to make it mirror iPhone concepts, they really gave up. It seemed like half of the reason was UX-y shared, unified experiences across devices but the other half was fuck it, write it once for both operating systems. Macs don't make us enough money to deserve the attention nowApple is turning into the McDonald's of technology. It's easy to get, works right out of the box, but doesn't do anything well enough to do any good for anyone in the long run. If Apple doesn't get their shit together with the iPhone 7 and the new iOS, I will be switching back to PC and Android with a quickness that knows no bounds.I honestly do not understand the issues with iTunes, I've never had any major issues with it whatsoever since being on a Mac. Also, Apples major problem is that they rush out software too fast. They have to release new products every year at the same time.. knowing the quality isn't where it needs to be. It's sad that it takes until a .2 update now, to have actual stable software. Mom bought an Iphone, day one connected it to laptop, transferred files."
"Day 2, connected to PC, can only transfer files after wiping iPhone, WTF?Sounds about right to meI have apple stuff. Heck, I admit I mostly buy apple stuff! Apple still has a certain kind of magic for me but it's wearing thin. The biggest plus for apple used to be the consistent user experience across all apple software and, for basic operations, even across third party software."
"I give them a little slack in that user interface design has become a nightmare, what with the myriad of exciting new interaction hardware available? from mouse to touch to voice? and all this on a myriad different hand tools, from keyboard to touch pad to mouse with touch pad to full direct manipulation on a phone or tablet?"
"Still... if it's so difficult to consolidate a good experience on all these devices then why the heck are they also focusing on cars?Fire the whole department . Keeping iTunes like that for ages is just a sign of throughout incompetency Apple absolutely ruined Itunes.I've been an OSX user for the last 6 years. I chose apple as my main platform because Windows majorly sucked (say what you will, but win7 is not a pinnacle of design or user experience) and there were no Linux laptops that had 8 years of battery life. I still think that Linux is one OS where there was no progress regarding battery life at all. And I think Apple hardware is awesome. They sell you awesomely engineered hardware and provide great service for it (example - I had 5 dead pixels on retina macbook purchased in the USA, apple reseller in Belgium got me a new screen in 4 days no questions asked, try that with Asus)."
"I worked with all OSX versions since 10.5 and I think Apple really don't understand what they are doing. Who are they going to cater on desktop - so-called Pro Users (which is a fancy term for <<Small businesses and enterprise>>) or home users who are using only web browser? Because with all these features they removing (root for example or botching down iWork suite) they surely will lose all Pro-customers. And even web browsing experience is not that great. I have Win10 installed on my mac and MS Edge is so much more faster in terms of rendering and FPS while scrolling."
"I had an iPhone and the best thing there is the app support. I mean developers put their soul in the App Store. But the hardware is mediocre at best, battery life is shitty, screen is low-res etc."
"I really hope they will get their shit together, at least with desktop OS. "
"Edit: wordMy demands of my iPhone aren't that crazy. All I want to be able to do is delete programs like Apple Watch. Or the Apple weather app. Or all of the many programs that are now in my Useless folder on my phone."
"Why can't I do that?I recently took the plunge and got an iPad mini."
"It's some sweet hardware to be sure, but the software sucks."
"Clunky keyboard. I'm forever guessing at gestures. Copy and paste, never seems to select what I want. These are basics right?"
"Regret.I love Apple but I've noticed more issues over the past year or so. Simple glitches that never get fixed. Why can't we write on photographs within iOS Notes? Why isn't there automatic spell correct within the Notes section of OS X Contacts? Why don't Contacts and Reminders work better together? Why do phone numbers and links sometimes highlight for easy clicking in Reminders but sometimes do not? Why, when adding a new Group in OS X Contacts, does the highlighted input field usually crash upon the first attempt but not the second attempt? So many niggling issues.Not that I disagree but I need to point out that you're pointing out desired features, not glitches. Big difference.There's a mix in there.The interface on Apple Music is appallingAnd you'll see why 1984 won't be like 1984Well it's hard to make software shiny. I despise iTunes so much I uninstalled it from my Mac. Not an easy task considering how integrated it is into the Apple ecosystem.I generally prefer Apple products over their competitors. Have had several Android phones and several iPhones, definitely prefer the iPhone. Have had many PCs and Apple computers, definitely prefer the Apple computers."
"But they have definitely gone downhill. Like WHY DOES ALL MY MUSIC KEEP RANDOMLY DISAPPEARING OFF OF MY IPHONE? I'm sure I can figure out the problem and fix it (good 'ol google to the rescue), but the point is that I shouldn't HAVE to be googling around to figure out why the fuck my music won't stay on my phone when it worked fine in the several iPhones I've had for the last 4 or 5 years. They took away the ability to sync Notes when plugged directly into a laptop. You have to use iCloud or email them individually now. I *love* Apple products, generally speaking - and that simple fact will probably get me down voted :P"
"But iTunes is the biggest piece of shit software I have encountered on the Mac. Where most of OS/X just does what I want it to do when I want to do it - enough that I don't even need to check a manual for most things - iTunes is a constant frustration. Its seemingly core to so many activities, in so many ways, and yet its primary function seems to be to *prevent* me from doing what I want with my stuff. This is where Apple is falling on its face in my opinion."
"My only other criticisms that I can think of, off hand, is that Apple Maps doesn't seem to cache anything on my iPhone so it eats too much data to be using on a regular basis. Perhaps its me and someone will have a solution, but it would be a major improvement if it would just cache all the map data for say a 50 mile radius and updated it once every 6 months or so. Just street names and addresses, I don't give a damn about businesses."
"Also Preview. It used to be on my desktop that when I hit the space bar it opened up the file in Preview, as far as I can recall. N ow it opens it up in *something else* which has a Preview option. This is just annoying for no apparent reason.death of apple ect ect good riddancefor me, iTunes had this one function ages ago that I LOVED. it would create a random playlist of 25 songs from my entire music collection (which has always been large because I used to rip entire music archives from my friends and family) and would shuffle a new list after it was finished. I created some of my favourite playlists from that function, and when you have a music archive that was over 60gb, it was amazing."
"annnnd then they forced me to update iTunes when I got an iPhone and they had removed the function and replaced it with 'genesis' - which really only works if you bought all your music from iTunes and didn't rip the entire music archive from your high schools server in 2005. My music collection is now over 130gb now, and I don't know what to use to handle it, other than the horror and monstrosity that is iTunes. Am I the only one here who hasn't experienced any of the problems everyone is citing? iTunes? I open up iTunes literally once every 2-3 years when I upgrade my iPhone. I back up over iCloud in the time between. I listen to music all day long, but I use Google Music (RIP, Rdio) which you can also upload your own music to if you want. I've never had an issue with Apple software with either an iPhone 4s, 6, or a Macbook. Everything's worked great. People hate on iTunes a lot, at least on Macs its awesome, on my PC I haven't had an issue with it but I don't use that nearly as much.Not gonna lie, this is music to my ears. I do own a iPhone 5s and Galaxy S5, but the iPhone is for work only. I couldn't imagine if I used it to the extent of my S5...I'm sure I'd be having slowdown issues.xcode is literal devil's spawn.We are?So now Apple has overpriced hardware and bad software... what's the argument for getting their products again? The hardware is fucking gorgeous."
"But that's the only reason.Steve Jobs wouldn't have allowed it to get this bad. His medical literacy may have been kooky, but he still would have screamed at someone stupid enough to think that bloating people with useless updates was a good idea.Software aside how about their $400 Apple Watch that breaks easily from daily use and then they want $225 to replace said screen.As a tech guy I repeatedly find OSX/IOS harder to use than Windows/Android. In the process of trying to simplify things they actually make them harder and infuriating. I dread ever having to copy music to my moms phone, iTunes makes it so incredibly difficult.Maybe that's just in an attempt to discourage piracy.  (tongue in cheek)Sometimes I wish I could just sit down with someone high up to in Apple's software development team and explain that they need to refocus attention on functionality and redundancy."
"Functionality is a matter of attention to detail, including providing for both simple, low complexity, commonly-needed uses and specialized, seldom needed, but product-defining uses. Apple appears to have heavily weighted the former and whittled away at the latter. Perhaps it is an effort to streamline user-support and try to deal with the mass-use case. Which unfortunately means it's just a matter of time before everybody will run into the lack of support for obvious but non-common tasks at some point, making the products seem like they are toys, not ready for prime-time use."
"An example of this kind of behavior (there are many) is the removal of Reveal in Finder support in iTunes and Photos. In an effort to prevent users gaining access to the raw data they own (I suspect because they might accidentally move something), the user is stuck with an unnecessary and time consuming export process. A less trivial example is the lack of ability to fix a corrupted Time Capsule backup. It appears to be just a matter of time before a Time Capsule backup fails its monthly validation test. The only official recovery option is to throw the entire backup away (potentially years of history) and start from scratch. Sure one should have more than one backup mechanism in play but the catastrophic failure window is widened by this lack and that reflects directly on the OS."
"Redundancy is a matter of providing several equivalent mechanisms to perform the same task, allowing the user to develop a style of use and provides for enthusiastic transfer of technique from one user to another (buzz)."
"An example of the loss of redundancy would be the removal of the press-and-hold to pop-up a copy control in iOS Photos. The feature has recently been hidden under a sharing icon. Why not allow both mechanisms? Again, there are many such simplifications"
"Finally there's just the stupid stuff. Off the wall UI decisions and omissions that appear to be brain farts that somehow made it to production. QuickTime player's full window-width volume control that resizes with the window makes it almost impossible to set a consistent volume level visually. Making a bring-to-front click in QuickTime Player's window also an active click in that window is just wrong (click near the play-position area while the app is not to front (to bring it to front) changes the play position without requiring a second click). Where is drag and drop editing in XCode with optional drag-and-drop text copy? How is it that Safari, after all these years, still cannot handle real-time mouse icon transitions (why are there occasions where I still have to close Safari windows clicking on the red close-control while the mouse is displaying a text bar, not a pointer)?"
"I am a Mac enthusiast. I'm not switching to Windows for production work any time soon (it still takes me 3 times the time to get similar complex projects finished under Windows (I have used both OS' for years)) but it does seem like Apple is lacking some core direction and that's a high level management issue not a technical one.> What's worse, Microsoft, against which Apple always measured its software's elegance and seamlessness, has shed its old shortcomings -- its Windows 10, released last year, garnered almost universal raves."
"Lol, because competition is bad right?! this will probs get burried. but does anyone feel like apple is repeating history with their software?"
"for example classic mac os in the later iterations started to become just a bunch of things added together with no thought and it suffered as a result until osx. But now i feel osx / ios are starting to walk down that path again and eventually apple will need another rebootI am not defending Apple, but Id like to give a little perspective.  "
"Imagine you are a software dev, and you are embracing a brand new platform, and getting in on the ground floor. Everything is possible, and you experiment and make a few stumbles, but people are willing to give you some breathing room because if you're the first product to market, they have no choice. And nothing else to unfavorably compare you to. The point is, you can make the rules.  "
"Now fast forward ten years. You try to make an app, but everything has already been done, and everything is patented, so you have to work around it and come up with different,  less elegant ways to do the same thing. You don't get to use your first, best idea, everything is your fourth or fifth solution to the same problem. And then there's legal telling you you cant do this and that, and then theres the marketing team telling you its too similar to something else you already have, and then theres a guy from the Asia-Pacific team telling you to change something because its actually a dirty word in Mandarin, and then theres a guy from another department telling you you have to change a button because its shaped like a holy symbol in some country they havent moved into yet but want to eventually, and then theres marketing again, telling you its not on message, and then these guys in black sunglasses tell you you have to take THIS out, because you didn't hear it from them, but its kind of similar to something they may or may not be working on for a future release.  "
"Its a miracle ANYTHING gets released any more. I wouldn't want to be a software dev if my life depended on it.It's sad that a billion dollar company has 'fans'.  People don't owe these companies anything yet I bet there are those in this thread defending their shitty practices because they happen to be in their ecosystemI don't love it, but have gone 3 years without any significant phone issue,  wiping my phone, closing app, or ios slowdown. With my androids prior it was s nightmare. I'd gladly go back to android but one  day into ownership of a s6 i experienced ui slowdown and said 'nope! I'd love to try it again but I'm scared. I have always loved the iPhone's I've owned, but I have to admit, with each iOS ipdate, my iPhone 5 seems to be getting slower and slower I bought an iphone 5 (my first) a year ago. It worked good, I was happy with it. Then came out iOS 9. I updated my phone. Biggest mistake ever. Phone got real slow and shiity in general very quickly. The software update couldn't be rolled back. They do this intentionally to force people to upgrade to the newer phone. When this phone dies completely, I'm going back to android.It's like Apple hired all the guys fired by Microsoft for making Vista, to make iTunes. iTunes is a steaming heap.iTunes really is garbage. Considering it's supposed tone the central hub between devices (I know iCloud is sort of supposed to be but yeah right...) it really is terrible. This probably wouldn't be as big of an issue on iOS if Apple turned the keys over to be able to set other programs as default. I hated Apple before it was cool. /sI do so love my Surface Book.iTunes has always been a beast from hell though...I can't remember how many times I had to uninstall and reinstall it on XP and 7 before finally getting rid of it completely. It is/was a resource hog, and once started, is ALWAYS running."
"I'm glad I found google play music when it was first starting out. It has it's problems, don't get me wrong, but I enjoy the fact I can just throw all my music form my spare hard drive onto the cloud and then I can access it anywhere I am, and only for like 7 bucks a month.> its Windows 10, released last year, garnered almost universal raves."
"That's a pretty big almost.I never knew so many people were having issues with Mail & Preview.  I can honestly say I've never had either of those crash on me.PAYWALLED LA Times is now on my banned list."
"Hey reddit please stop posting links to paywalled sites like this - it just encourages them to keep being dicks.it all went downhill after they started forcing newer software on older hardware I lost faith in Apple when they abandoned Aperture. Aperture 1.0 was exactly what the digital photography market needed. Photoshop is a great program but it never addressed the photography workflow concept at all. After Aperture came out Lightroom and various others followed but none did it as well as Aperture as of Aperture 3.0.  Aperture 3.0 had some issues. It didn't scale well for massive photo catalogs. It never had a means to correct optical flaws. Apple could have fixed that. But they didn't, they just let it rot.  "
"It seems like the same thing happened to Final Cut. As I understand it Final Cut was an industry leader in video editing and Apple dumbed the product down a few years ago and let the industry slip through their fingers. I have an iPhone. I like it pretty good. "
"I haven't used iTunes in years. Maybe that's why. "
"Why do people use iTunes? "
"I know you used to need it to update your phone a long time ago How have I never had these issues, Ive had my iPhone 5 since it came out and have the newest iOS. Aside from iTunes being annoying to manage songs on occasion none of these problems exist to me. I actively avoid plugging my iPhone into my PC, just to not have to deal with iTunes. People say the worst a lot these days, and it should probably be reserved for tyrannical dictators, mass killers and the like...and iTunes.You lost me when you said I had to plug my phone/tablet into a computer?..wtf..Wireless Sync, you should really look into that..I used to edit movies all the time in iMovie, but ever since they dropped the timeline editor I honestly don't know how to edit movies with sense of precision. The thing is a mess. I'll leave [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/43o3lf/uninstalling_facebook_app_saves_up_to_20_of/czjtuf7?context=3) here. It happened in 2009."
">One example: Forcing someone to install iTunes, Bonjour, Quicktime, and a bunch of other Apple crap on my PC then sync the damn thing just to use a usb cable as a charger back in '09. The dumb ipod refused to charge or give its owner a charge-only option to select. Only install-ALL-TH^E-THINGS."
">Took me over a month to remove all the iMalware and liberate my PC and media collection. ***NEVER AGAIN!***"
">EDIT: I'm sure Apple's cooled its jets about this since Tim Cook took over.Bullshit. Apple fans will never hate Apple. That's the main draw of their marketing machine. And if they have mild dislike for some of the software they will stick with Apple anywayThey should hire Steve Jobs back. That guy took the company places.Working in tech support, El Capitan is the devil...I went to upgrade the OS on my macbook. I first read the reviews and it seems like people hate the latest OS. Makes me nervous to upgrade.My only gripe is with iOS' version of iTunes.  This is coming from a guy who defended iTunes' honor over the last 10 years.iTunes is just dreadful to use. I dread having to open it do support for my family. besides the fact that every update makes your older devices a bit worse each time, iTunes is clunky, Safari is a memory suck, and it seems like they are going the way of Microsoft lately (aka, the release version should really be the Beta, and the upgrade is what the original release should have been but dont get used to it because a new one is coming down the pipeline)Whoever changed the way the music is organized on the iphone should go to jail for 1,000 counts of manslaughter. It used to be nice and easy to navigate and choose a somf. Now you have to scroll and look at your phone more just to play your song. Not a big problem until you think about all of the people driving that want to listen to their music."

"Ive always been a fan of both microsoft and apple. I really hope microsoft doesnt go down the apple route.Why the heck can't the music app be in landscape mode?The Itunes app on my phone makes zero sense to me, unless I sit down and manually create a playlist on my computer before opening on my phone. It's useless, worse than useless because all of my music is there but there's no easy way to find it."
"The desktop version is confusing and unnecessarily complicated. If I want to buy a fucking song or movie, I will go to the Itunes store and buy it; don't cram shit down my throat. Why's this so hard for people to understand?Apple's software and OS were the reason I used Apple, and the reason I stopped using Apple.I agree with the sentiment in this thread. They need to step up software quality like they used to. I've also been feeling bored with the iOS 7 aesthetic, where iOS 6 aesthetic didn't really get old until everything started to get flat."
"But it's amazing how only negative Apple threads will get any traction in this subreddit.I seriously hate when voice control takes over my iPhone and calls my ex via the Facebook contact list link.  "
"How do I turn voice control off?The iTunes Music app on iOS is an absolute mess. It used to be simple. I hate it! Any good alternatives?It blows my damn mind that can't send an attachment while IN the mail app. It's so dumb that you absolutely have to select something before composing the email."
"I'm a recent apple convert myself, and I do like many things, but it's things like that that make wonder how the hell it was even greenlit."
"The news app is damn near flawless, though.But. But apple is cool. It has commercials with lots of hands and colors and hip young people, that means its gotta be the best. Please apple, how much money do you want from me today?I don't have a problem with most Apple software. It seems to work just fine. But the Podcast app, now that is the biggest piece of shit app I've ever used. It frequently crashes, stops working in the middle of playing podcasts, etc. Then I have it set to not download anything, only streaming and somehow it is now taking up 1GB of space on my phone and I can't figure out why.I tried using iTunes a long time ago on my brother's computer. This was probably 2 years ago. And I'm still annoyed/pissed off.My iPad mini just crashed while I was reading this article.iTunes is so bad these days, article is right. I hate iTunes, the rest is okI haven't synced with itunes in ages. I use soundcloud and spotify. And in rare cases, youtube. Steve is dead so is apple.One of my Macs is very insistent that I upgrade to El Capitan. Hell no I say after upgrading the other two: no tangible benefits but busted audio implementation on one I did upgrade and wifi problems on the other (neither problem existed before the upgrade).Glad I'm not the only one who refuses to sync or update with any apple software. And seeing as my phones break like clockwork once the warranty is up I think I'm just going to try HTC.There are so many little things that piss me off every day. "

"> He fingered iTunes for the desktop (I dread opening the thing), and the Mail, Photos, and iCloud programs."
"iTunes: I play music with it.  It plays the music. What's to dread?"
"Mail: I don't use it."
"Photos: I don't use it."
"iCloud: I don't use it."
"People (understandably) hate using iTunes to manage their phone, but why are people using it for that? I haven't connected my phone to my laptop except for charging for years, literally. With iCloud backups, getting a new phone is as easy as plugging it in, logging into iCloud, and waiting a while."
"I don't buy apps through iTunes. I don't buy music through it (I actually like Apple Music - infinite pre-paid library, yay!). I don't back my phone up with it. What are people doing that they still need to have an opinion on how much it sucks to use iTunes with their phones?They made the Apple pencil! I honestly didn't believe that shit. I thought the Onion really nailed them good but it was realll life Apple have solid products in terms of build and construction, I won't deny that. Unfortunately, their software is terrible. Too many people are in the grasp of the bought another because I'm used to it mentality. With every update, their software is slower and less efficient on older hardware. It's times like these where I just want to tell people to buy a fucking Android already.Never had any issues with iTunes before but I sure can't get photos off my iphone 6 using the new photos Crapp. Although my phone is jailbroken so maybe it just doesn't play nice anymore. I had to buy Anytrans to get them on to my MacBook pro and now I prefer that method.Until they fire Tim Cook and hire someone more artsy than fartsy they are going to keep shitting the bed.  Their stock has been trending downward since the apple watch tanked.  "
"Apple needs a crazy, design happy, user experience oriented loon running the show.  That creature is decidedly not Tim Cook.Is this news to anyone? This is my thought, but I need help fleshing it out: whenever a person or an idea is great and becomes big time, then that corporation or organization will slowly be infiltrated by people that want to fleece the public. I need a better way to phrase this but I feel it happens all the time.Steve we need you :(Fucking keychain broke in the latest release...mother fuckery It's ironic, google which is such a excellent s/w developing org can't get the device right and on the other hand apple, who design and make some of the best devices can't get it's s/w right, right? Almost every daily app I used on my phone is actually from Google, youtube, mail, google photos(yeah it's better in syncing across plantforms than Photos), maps ect, but I can't stand the android devices and non-apple computers, it's just too much of an eye-sore.I used to love google music on my iPhone but now all searches default to the radio, not what is in my library."
"Drives me nuts.I've been buying iPod touches since they came out, mostly to have a dedicated music device, second for the apps. But with the latest music app update, I'm just done with it. It's a compete hassle, unintuitive and annoying overall to use. "
"Since iOS 7 I don't understand how people still love the iPhone. So much white, and to me overall such an annoying interface. I recently abandoned Apple and headed back to Android. The value's never been there, but now the quality is arguably lower than on the lion's share of Android-driven devices there's no reason for me to pay the premium.I guess I'm a minority...I have no issues with any of the software at all, and the updates that have any meaningful feature updates always add a nice little perk here and there that I end up using pretty consistently."
"My 2012 MBP is still working perfectly...and my iPhone, as it always does, works just how I need and want it to.  Are there things I wish we had? Sure! But I don't hate anything on any of my Apple products, because it all works just fine for me.I was especially pissed when I updated the OS and they removed iMovie and Garage Band from my '09 Macbook Pro. The laptop came with the programs and though they were pretty outdated, it still worked for my needs.  Sure, I could purchase the software for like $20 bucks, but the point is - why should I have to buy it again when I already owned it? "
"Also, I recently used the newer version iMovie on a school computer, and it is super super shitty. Just get rid of apple maps.. google maps is so far ahead of you.Some people would call me an Apple apologist, but I've use iTunes maybe once in the past year. It's not the best app, but there are few reasons to use it nowadays.Does anyone else blame planned obsolescence for this? I swear to god the more times I update my phone the slower and more inconsistent it gets. It would take a  moron not to notice that PO would eventually erode away at costumer satisfaction and the loss would catch up with the revenue of units sold.All apps, regardless of platform, will take up more requirements as they add features/improve/et-al. This isnt an issue with IOS, but every app on the phone. "
"people used to complain when their idevices didn't get updated. now they complain they get updates with new features that require more hardware resourcesBecause it's total shit unless you have very specific creative needs?I have an iPhone 4s, and I'm due to upgrade soon. I'm fairly certain I will be moving over to an android phone, Apple just keeps doing things I just don't like. Apple has to fall I owned an iPhone 1,2,3, and 4. I will never use an iPhone again after switching to Android. Apple locks down their phone devices too much and simply gives the user no control. Still at least love my macbook pro tho <3iTunes has always sucked, but the devices felt so good to use that it was 'worth it'"
"Now the competition has caught up on the hardware side IMO.I don't know if anyone has even touched on the cluster*** of the experience of trying to use an OS X device for work."
"I have a Macbook Air and it's a fantastic piece of hardware.  Light as hell, boots right up, does pretty much everything I want a personal-use computer to do.  Yes, iTunes is a mess but overall I can deal with it just fine."
"But try using native Apple apps for work - I dare you.  Mail is nice in principle, but isn't ready for prime time.  Your font size constantly changes, some of your recipients will receive your text emails as a series of image files that each contain a little of the text, and it eventually creates an enormous backup file that does nothing but take up space.  I didn't even attempt to use Pages, etc. for work, opting instead for Microsoft Office for Mac, which is consistently several years behind (but in fairness, is not an Apple product).  Safari works okay unless you want to use Sharepoint (again in fairness, neither Chrome nor Edge work quite right either).  But what's astonishing to me is that Apple hasn't even tried to build a Sharepoint interface that works worth a damn.Is this an old article? iTunes has been awful since I got an iPod Photo. It has not gotten better. It's only use is to load songs onto my phone, and back my data up. I've never understood considering iTunes as a primary media player, unless maybe I had a supercomputer and all the ram in the world. I traded over to an iPhone when the 6s was released because I hadn't used an iPhone since the 3gs.  I'm generally pretty tech savvy, love all tech but I honestly could not keep that phone.  Basic UI functionality had barely changed since the 3gs and its inability to handle notifications and true multitasking in any meaningful way was horribly absent.  At that point I truly realized that Android had been under fire for so long and so hard that they had really kept up, if not driven the mobile phone market in terms of usability.  I was extremely disappointed at Apple for that.Apple products have never been about work. They simply offer the most basic functionality required. Fans shoved them into the business place regardless of how well they performed. IT admins suffered for many years during this transition. Things have improved tremendously but man it was rough. "
"It would seem with iTunes, in particular, that every update makes it harder for me to manage my music. It less of a music management software now and has become a gateway to sell me more stuff.Why does the alarm clock on my have a set time for snooze?  Literally every other alarm clock in the world lets you program how long a snooze it. my first iphone came with two or three apps i didn't use and i pushed them way off to the third or fourth page.  but now, on my third, i have a whole folder of nearly 20 apps that apple deems necessary that i have no known use for.  "
"watch, safari, reminders, ibooks, videos, health, mail, news, find friends, maps, stocks, wallet, podcasts, compass, contacts, tips, voice memos and game center.  Apple Music could try having a decent app instead of trying to strong arming people with exclusives.I enjoy my ipod's and my work iphone but updates suck and I have never liked Macs. Cannot stand the backwards UI. I don't believe there are Apple fans anymore, there are just people buying apple products.I haven't used iTunes for years...VLC is much better in so many ways.  I don't even use iTunes on my iPhone anymore, because it's slow, stupid, and takes forever to boot up.  And I just installed Linux Mint yesterday because your freedom keeps diminishing with every new OS.  No, I don't want to have to use XCode for tasks that shouldn't require it.  Yeah, Apple needs to get their shit together or they're going to lose a lot of customers.  The last time I had an iPhone device was when I upgraded from iPhone 3 to iPhone 4.  I really liked the iPhone, but I hated how it forced the Appstore and reliance on iTunes which was progressively getting shittier, slower, and more bulky.  I couldn't stand how putting a new album on my phone was suddenly a chore.  I also loathed having to use iPhoto anytime I wanted to add/remove photos. Then the software update came out and my phone became borderline unusable even though it was only like a year old.  I personally switched to android and never looked back, but I figured they'd smooth out the problems and streamline it back to what people loved.  It blows my mind that over 5 years later everyone still has the SAME core issues with their iPhones.It's funny, I've always been a PC and I have always owned Samsung phones, yet I quite enjoy iTunes. It sorts music very well and looks very nice. Not to mention the ease with which you can share music on it. They didn't even point out a legitimate problem with it. I think it's improved over the last 2 years. "
"Edit: literally no one agrees with mei agree with you. years ago, when ipods were ubiquitous, i began using itunes to sync and manage my music on my pc and have been using itunes without any major problems ever since."
"my favorite thing about it is the way i can display all my music by album covers. so pretty pretty...Yeah, I have a lot of music, and while the normal file browser only sorts it by artist name, I can sort by whatever I'd like in iTunes. I'm using an iPhone 5... Im fed up with it but can't afford to replace itI liked apple products when the iPhone came on the scene, truly a great product that ushered in the new era of smart phones. Then I switched to Android and never thought of anything else. I don't need a computer to transfer music and files. Apple prides itself on its limited access and over priced products with pleasing aesthetic looks. Every apple fan I have met knows next to nothing about computers and insists that apple it's the end all be all of technology. Half these problems with Apple's eco system could be solved with two major changes:"
"1.  Finally build their next Mac OS kernel and move beyond OSX.   Really, they have had OSX since 1999.   The OS is practically a centenarian in computer years.   Time to retire it and face the future with a new OSXI build.   Microsoft went through the pain so it is possible to get past using an aged kernel and file system."
"2.   Stop using iTunes as the Grand Central Station for everything mobile-related.   it's a music service.   Polish that part and detach all those update services, file/calendar/FB syncs, and App installs off it.   Make a separate iControl for all of that other mobile stuff.  The less cluttered a program is, the more it will be as Jobs said, It just works.For #1 I'm pretty sure the windows kernel is older, but your #2 is spot on.apple died with steve...Close.  Apple died when they lost Steve to keep Ive in line.  "
"Apple will be able to survive if Ive gets hit by a Truck ... because as Steve said, there's always going to be a need for a Truck (not a trash can).  "
"Said truck may be figurative, but the more ineffective Cook has become in keeping Ive from doing stupid UI things (more minimalism in the wrong places) the more I suspect that the Truck needs to be a literal one. Precisely why I still use Logic Pro 9 and won't go any higher than Mavericks. Don't even get me started on iTunes and Apple Music.... Together, they have created a Spotify user fo lyfe. Itunes aside (worst ever) I am extremely disappointed with the iphone mail app - Ok it works, but it is featureless! why cant i send two pictures via email? why cant i collapse folder? WHYThat'll happen when you rely on marketing and brand name recognition rather than the actual product...I've loved Apple's products From 1997 till the launches of the trashcan (MacPro) and the Retina display MacBook Pro."
"Photos is a horrible replacement for iPhoto."
"BusyCal makes Calendar (formerly iCal) look like trash."
"PathFinder puts the Finder to shame!"
"The UI changes to iTunes make the program almost unusable!"

"This single feature drove so many people to take another look at Apple Laptops, it can't be overstated."
"Yes Apple's newest flagshit (not a typo) laptop: The MacBook has abandoned this stalwart of Apple's laptops since 2006!!!"
"This is NOT the Apple I fell in love with, and it sure as hell isn't the Apple that showed the world excellence in software design!The complete and utter debacle on Mac OS X when they moved Ebooks out of iTunes and into a separate iBooks app, removing the ability to edit metadata for books (kind of important if, like me, you create your own out of technical notes) and then actually moving all your books from your iTunes library and hiding them (and renaming each one with an obscure name and burying them five layers deep in your user folder?)"
"Whoever thought that was a good idea ought to be sacked. "
"Apple: We can no longer decrypt iPhones for law enforcement, starting w/ iOS 8.Apple refers to the 6/6 rating from the EFF Who has your back? report. Here's the report and the other companies reviewed: https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-2014"

Their work on making devices a lot more environmentally sustainable and recyclable has won them a lot of praise from the likes of Greenpeace.Microsoft, apple, and Google have all got more stars this year than last!

They really have no incentive to be honest, especially if the government *wants* them to be secretive about this stuff. In fact, they probably have every reason to lie. Regardless of how nice and attentive a company might appear on the outside, there's nothing the public can do to verify these claims, which means trusting them is just that: trusting them."
"We ought to view these privacy policies and transparency reports as just what they are: marketing material. Personally, I don't trust them any more than I trust the average TV commercial. If you want to keep your data private, then don't just hand it off to some company, no matter how many promises they make.

Wasn't the government supposed to keep us secure from companies?"
"Edit: Sorry, I'm not a government major. I was informed several times that this is wrong.The government should punish a criminal who breaks into your house.  They are not responsible for putting locks on your doors.The US government was only ever **supposed** to keep us safe from the aggression of others (originally). Companies have voluntary interactions with their customers. "
"I am happy to live in a western country but if you look at all governments ever you should not be surprised. It's run by humans and humans are fucked up.Essentially if you live in a first world country someones fucking you over and you dont know it. If you live in a third world country then youve already been fucked over and you know it. > We have also never allowed any government access to our servers. And we never will."
"Allowed is the important word here. Judging by the fact that single hacker leaked photos from iCloud, they don't have that good security system.I applaud Apple's commitment to user privacy, but it's clear they chose their words very carefully. For one, as you pointed out, they have never _allowed_ the government access to their servers. They also don't comment on whether they _give out_ information when asked by, for example, law enforcement. Personally, I think that's OK, if a person is properly suspected of a crime. It's the warrantless, routine collection of data on otherwise innocent people I despise."
"It's clear Apple wants to impress upon people that they value their privacy and rights, but it's also clear they're not openly defiant of law enforcement or intelligence gathering as a whole. They'll abide by the laws such as they are written, but they take an open stand against the secret kind of intelligence gathering so popular these days.Do people expect Apple to go against the law before they will allow that Apple is trying to ensure customer privacy and transparency? Are we also asking Amazon, Facebook and Google to be as defiant of law enforcement? If not why?I don't like it even if suspected of a crime. To me it's about the same as being suspected of robbing a store I didn't rob then having my house bugged until they determine I'm not a suspect. For instances in the documentary cracktown USA law enforcement bugged a crackhouse not just until a crime was committed, they did that for like a year, can you imagine ever word and in this case video of what you did in your home open to someone else's interpretation?That's not a problem with surveillance per se, but rather a problem with what kind of surveillance is _legal_ and why. The problem isn't that they _do_ this, the problem is that they _are allowed to_. Fix the laws, and you fix the problem (at least in a perfect world)."
"When I say it's OK for Apple to cooperate with law enforcement, mean that under the conditions of there being a _specific_ warrant that is clearly limited in both time and scope. There should have to be a suspicion of a crime of a certain degree or severity before a judge can even order a warrant, and the warrant itself should be specific and narrow, as well as limited in time."
"These things aren't Apple's war to fight. In fact, it's more yours. Elect representatives that protect your rights by limiting the powers of law enforcement and courts. Speak to them about these issues and _why_ you feel the system does not work the way it's set up today.Apple doesn't have a stance either way; they will follow the law and they will also release statements to their customers that they want to hear. Who knows, in ten years we may be thankful for much of this data gathering; but, don't be surprised when all the players involved laud their efforts in helping the Government get the information.I don't understand your position."
"Apple does not collect meaningful amounts of data, and what is collected is not specific per user."
"Anything that does need to pass through Apple's servers is encrypted and Apple does not have the key."
"Apple responds to LE requests only when presented a warrant, and will provide only the smallest amount of information necessary to fulfill the request. (stated in the link)"
"So Apple does not collect routine data on otherwise innocent people, and seem to be as openly defiant as they possibly can to LE and intelligence gathering as a whole.What about the celebrity nudes? Everyone had access to those.allowedFrom the way they encrypt the data, that really would be the easiest way for a government to get in. But as the fappening showed us, most people are so insecure in their day to day internet life that no government would really care that much if apple said no. They got other avenues to persue - more than they can count.No fucking shit. It's blatantly obvious that someone could hack into their servers or physically steal their data centers, literally no one is safe from this. This is more anti-apple circlejerk right here.Except that if they had they would also be legally  unable to admit it....and plausible deniability is the important operational principle here.That's nice and all, but that sentence fragment is upsetting me.I still do not understand why so many people believe Snowden's bullshit. You have all had ample time to learn how the networks have been built and how the systems operate. You have also had ample to time to honestly assess the feasibility of the claims. "
"I have been in this industry for 15 years, and I have not heard a single expert critique this silliness in the media. "
"Let me help you out. The only truth to any of it was the call data (who called who and when). And, I would chalk that up to laziness from the telco. The other claims are fanciful crap. "
"Jesus, people. Do some research. As if they would have a choice. I'm sure everyone is just really happy to hand it all over to government.No permissive entry. Oh myyyyy.If they rephrase this to given access or allowed then I'm sold. This is the same argument everybody used when the first privacy shitstorm hit"
"Its just spin"
"You don't NEED to give anyone access to the physical servers, and they don't need to waste their time travelling, if you're willing to just email them any info they want off it."
"They never said we've never allowed them to have your data, they said a very specifically and carefully worded response that ALMOST means they never gave your data"
"If you actually read the linked page, and the more detailed reports linked from it, they are very specific about how many law enforcement requests they have received, breaking them down by category, region and country, and giving the best estimate of the ones they're not allowed to talk about they are legally permitted to."
"> A tiny percentage of our millions of accounts is affected by national security-related requests. In the first six months of 2014, we received 250 or fewer of these requests. Though we would like to be more specific, by law this is the most precise information we are currently allowed to disclose.> If you actually read the linked page"
"Nobody here does that, especially if it involves Apple. They just comment with their gut.Or the govt doesn't actually need access to their servers to get their shit.Afaik Apple recently transferred cloud services from Amazon's cloud to their own newly constructed server farms. On these servers they threw away the backend encryption keys as soon as the drives were encrypted. So now quite  literally there is no way to decrypt the data without the users password. Which password Apple can only access by resetting, and per system protocols once a password is reset it can never be the same password again. So the only way to break in would necessitate the user knowing they had been compromised. "
"Even if the NSA had access to the physical machines the only way they could access  the data is by having copied the encryption keys the moment they were created. It is therefore feasible to think that they may not have access. Sure. But I hope you're not suggesting that it renders the claim meaningless? The NSA is a hugely sophisticated spying organization. I don't know that Apple, or anyone else can assert with certainty that their serves are not breached."
"That Apple does not consent, or actively permit government access to those servers (it claims), is meaningful and important. I wonder which of the other tech giants can make such a statement.[deleted]What if I told you that google's version of open source isn't really that open? Do they pay astroturfers by the word now?>What if I told you that google's version of open source isn't really that open?"
"It is far more open then Apple. Yes, all the apps that google develops are closed source, but you can chose not to use or run them. With apple, you are strait up stuck.What if I told you that aosp is released by Google every upgrade. You sound like you're quoting something you thought you heard/read. When people say Android isn't really open source they mean that the public doesn't have access to or develop for the code prior to release, unlike other open source projects where the community can contribute to at any time.AOSP Android is shit now, especially since Google have released their *own* closed source version of the majority of Android Apps.Yes, their own apps that *they* developed in house and offer for *free* are closed, but the majority of the OS is open for development."
"I don't see a problem with them protecting some of their own code (when compared to Apple anyway).If it's such shit, then how does it end up being the base of CyanogenMod, Paranoid Android, OmniROM et. al.? Not to mention it's what Amazon starts off with for all of its devices.To be honest a lot of important (although not essentials) parts of Google's Android, like Google play Services, are closed source. Indeed but they are not a part of the OS though, they are applications on top.... that you can use Android entirely without.Does *anyone* actually do that?The claim is meaningless. If that whole NSA sorry achieved one thing it's that weird doublespeak. They don't give them access to the server? Great, so I guess they're either pushing the requested data. Or give the NSA access to the network instead of the servers so they can read the data as it goes by. The claim is meaningless because the servers are meaningless. The data is what the government shouldn't get. I may just be high, but *what the fuck are you talking about?*I think I got it, he's saying like if you told your mom you didn't take the cookies from the cookie jar, but what you don't tell her is you told your younger brother to take them and share with you. "
"Disclaimer: I could be wrong as fuck. /u/Bolusop is acknowledging the prevalence of doublespeak in ... everywhere, but especially statements directed to 'the public.' It's when you say something that is technically true but misleading. It's the deliberate misuse of language."
"It's like the husband who says to his wife I never slept with that whore! And really he fucked the whore, yet never lay in the bed and slept with her. It's *technically* true, but deceptive in the context of what the issue really is. "
"(It works too if you put the emphasis on *that*. The husband didn't sleep with *that* whore; he slept with *this* one.)"
"He is monkeying around with language to lie without telling a falsehood."
"Apple is trying to get street cred for some action/condition they may or may not be doing, and we have no idea what's going on, except we've seen some pretty scary PPT presentations about the grand scale and power of nation-state scale spying. "
"**TLDR: Weaselwords. They're weasel words.**When privacy is concerned, corporations and agencies are known to craft their PR statements in such a way that they are accurate (so they don't lie), however the meaning is only valid for those carefully chosen words together."
"For example:"
"> We have also never allowed any government access to our servers.    "
"This could still mean (I'm not saying it does, just that it *could*) that:    "
"- they never specifically *allowed* access, but did not forbid it either    "
"- *they* had never allowed access, but someone else did    "
"- they could be renting their servers so they are not technically *their own* servers     "
"- they could be allowing access to another company, not the government itself   "
"- they could send the government any data they request    "
"- etc, etcI think more accurate for Apple would be 'we store no data worth anything to the govt. So we aren't as bad as the cell companies that we support /support us amirite?' > they had never allowed access, but someone else did"
"This is especially important, since iCloud is hosted on Microsoft and Amazon cloud services.Not anymore actually. What they're referring to is the new server farms Apple built. Once the drives were encrypted they threw away the persistent  state encryption keys, so literally, without your password there is no way to access the data. > Once the drives were encrypted they threw away the persistent state encryption keys"
"err what?Well its not like they have any ability to control that... so I don't think the blame should be put on the company.the large companies like Apple and Google are going to have to be the ones to take a stand... its just way to easy for the government to take out the smaller companies i disagree.  smaller companies can refuse and just go out of business. a few have done that.  larger companies don't have that option.The scary thing about this is that criminals would just move their communications away (even program their own encrypted networks, don't even have to rely on ToR) leaving the only people governments can spy on as innocent, everyday, people. Therefore, the only reason governments want this access is to control the population (figure out how they tick in private, then manipulate this).Someone else posted this link on the Julain Assange AMA - https://wikileaks.org/Op-ed-Google-and-the-NSA-Who-s.html "
"I don't think you can trust Google, they are tied to the NSA etc.No.  It's the big telecom ISP providers that have to.  They own the backbones that all internet traffic flows through.  You don't need to break into someones mailbox to read their mail if you can simply read it inside the mail truck or at the post office.Even if they did, they are limited in their ability to publicize it. Yahoo fought for a quite a while without anyone knowing. true.. but enough people Google that I bet if they put it on their front page daily it would get noticed...otherwise isps would block it via big brother... but I'd hope that would be a wakeup call..The problem is gag orders. They literally *can't* put it on their front page. The best that they could do is add a canary.why not? what's the worse that would happen from violating a gag order? fines that could be put off while the legal team fights it and the support of the populace is aquiredGoogle won't be shutdown, they'll just start putting shareholders in jail. I don't think you understand the 'limited liability' part of a limited liability company. I'm not saying I know what would happen, but pursuing shareholders is not one of them.Banks get away with much worse every day and they're still in business. What's the government going to do? Put Google in jail?At that point I think there would be public outrage too."
"If the top people in Apple and Google are put in jail because they won't spy on their users, then you would have a trial, and I think he american people would notice. "
"Tech press and tech journalism is getting bigger every year. That would make huge waves. The NSA wouldn't risk that. It would jeopardize their operation and draw too much attention to it. >I think he american people would notice"
"The problem is, they wouldn't.Well that's the point of a canary. Ever heard of a miner's canary? Miners would take a canary with them, because they were known to be fragile. If the canary died suddenly, the miners knew they hit a poison gas pocket and should evacuate."
"And a gag order canary is similar - it's something that is part of the site, saying We aren't under a gag order, as of [current date]! Then if they get put under a gag order, they simply kill the canary by not updating it. People see the dead canary, and know that they're under a gag order. And legally, a gag order *cannot* force someone to continue to update something (like the canary). That would be a very slippery slope, where the government could say We're compelling you to lie to these people, and will throw the book at you if you refuse!"
"And, in Yahoo!'s case, they were threatened with *enormous* fines (it was like $200k **per day** or something crazy like that,) unless they followed the gag order *and* allowed access.In case anyone doesn't believe /u/Mr_Cumbox , here's an article about it: http://boingboing.net/2013/11/05/apple-hides-a-patriot-act-bust.html"
"You can also find out more by searching for the term 'warrant canary'.[deleted]You're so right, its not like the government would harass them with permanent audits by the IRS, or suddenly find kiddie porn on some of their spoke-peoples computers etc."
"..."
"You are vastly underestimating the stupidity of the average public and the creativity of people in power."
"[deleted]Try and tell that story to Julian Assange, maybe you can still catch him on his AMA.ceo? thats what sysadmins and middle management is for...They had one, but now it's gone."
"http://boingboing.net/2014/09/18/apples-patriot-act-detecting.htmlThe company can't break a gag order, but laptops with secret documents get stolen all the time.They can use canary text on their frontpage.... they sure can, so that 2% of the people might get it... successBut it'll be translated and spread around for the masses by the 2%as opposed to us all knowing already that there are secret courts and absolute surveillance?"
"There is nothing wrong with canaries, problem is that they are both useless and are now becoming a symbol of resistance to some, that are just that, a meaningless symbol."
"Instead of actually taking action, symbolism is once again paralyzing the public discourse.Unless news networks think that some hacker called 4chan changed the reports.I don't see why they don't add a canary though.  What does that mean?The company publishes a monthly report that includes a section claiming to never have received requests for information from the government. If in their next report the section is missing, you know that it's no longer true. The point is to get the message out without actually saying anything. They did!"
"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/11/apples-first-transparency-report-gets-warrant-canaries-rightWhat happens if someone defies a gag order? dedContempt of court. At that point the court can order jail time (to the executives in the case of a company) or fines, or both."
"It gives the court an open ticket to do almost whatever they want to you, at that point you don't get to have a defense, appeal, or anything else unless they feel like giving it to you."
"Edit: There's no requirement for proportionality either, like a normal punishment. The court could fine you a million dollars an hour until you comply if it felt like it.So basically you have to lube up?Lube up and relax.what happens, if an international subsidiary defies the gag order that has been placed on the US company (e.g. the Google Finland Oy tells that drive isn't safe for use, because it might leak information to the NSA)?Then the US company broke the gag order.https://wikileaks.org/Op-ed-Google-and-the-NSA-Who-s.html"
"Here is an interesting read, if you think Google is just the knight in shining armor we all need (as I had thought, till I read into it) I still want to believe google is a friendly.I'd like to think well of Google, too, as it seems many people do. Unfortunately, though, I'm starting to suspect that they just have really good PR. . . > put it on their front page"
"That's not how gag orders work.warrant canary."
"Thats what [truecrypt](http://www.truecrypt.org) did. (take first letter of the words in the WARNING and translate into latin)"

"Translates to:"
"If i wish to use the NSAI don't get it. Wouldn't a gag order simply prevent the companies that use the warrant canaries from deleting or modifying the canaries since that would technically mean that those companies are violating the gag order indirectly by indirectly telling people that they received a gag order?Deniability is the key here. Intern Steve forgot to add that paragraph this week. Stupid Steve.Logically yes, but legally no. A National Security letter gags the company from confirming, denying, or talking about the National Security letter. "
"Source: my faulty memory and poor understanding of US law."
"Edit: maybe I'm a liar. Wikipedia doesn't say much except that a gag order is an option: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security_letter "
"and the EFF actually makes it sound like even a canary would be too revealing like you said: https://www.eff.org/issues/national-security-letters Recipients of NSLs are subject to a gag order that forbids them from ever revealing the letters' existence to their coworkers to their friends or even to their family members much less the public. What happens if you violate the order? Is that like...treason or something?> A National Security letter gags the company from confirming, **denying**, or talking about the National Security letter."
"So wouldn't that mean they would HAVE to remove the text denying the presence of an order that period?"
"I don't believe so.  Back in the old days when AAA auto club was first started, they used to have dudes riding around on motorcycles to help motorists.  One of the things these guys used to do, was warn motorists if there was a cop around who might catch them speeding.  The cops got pissed at this and the court said they couldn't tell motorists this info.  So what the AAA motorcycle dudes did was, they started always saying Hi to all motorists (salute? cap brim tip?).  If they DIDNT do this, now that meant there was a cop around.  Court can't mandate that the motorcycle dudes greet all motorists.Yeah I tried. Translating a single letter sounded stupid anyways. What was supposed to happen?The warning is Using TrueCrypt is not secure as it may contain unfixed security issues"
"UTinsaimcusi"
"uti nsa im cu si = if im with the use of the NSA according to Google translate. That's what he meant. Seems like reaching to me."
"http://boingboing.net/2014/06/17/possible-hidden-latin-warning.html"
"*uti nsa im cu si is meaningless in Latin - except to Google translate, (mis)translates it to the message Badon discovered."
"Neither im nor cu are Latin words at all, and while si and uti are, they don't mean the words that Google claims they do: instead, si translates to if, and uti to in order to. What seems to have happened is that Google recognised enough Latin words to think it was translating a real sentence, and then made its best effort to cram the rest of the words into a vaguely grammatical sentence.*"
"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/17/truecrypt-secret-message-nsa-spyingShhh, don't let logic get in the way of a good conspiracy.I think that's the point of it though.  The NSA/government comes back at Truecrypt and says, Whoa!  We had a gag order, but you let info out!  Truecrypt says, No we didn't.  We had a string of gibberish and someone used Google translate in Latin and it came up with something that just happened to be relevant.  However, it's clearly not Latin, or any language, by any stretch, so we have done nothing wrong.But I heard that if you take the third letter of every word in the Book of Revelations, scramble them, add a few letters then remove some, it says the NSA is hacking all our computers.I was actually reading an article about how companies like google have a warrant canary in their monthly reports."
"Now that they are releasing reports in how often the government requests any information, there is a small section that says that they haven't received any requests (warrants) pursuant to a specific statute."
"The warrants under that statute come with a gag order, so the second they get one that part of their report will go missing. Then everyone will know there's a gas leak in the mine shaftWouldn't the gag order require them to keep writing they hadn't gotten any requests?A gag order can only legally prevent them from writing/publishing information. It can't force them to write anything. That's why it works so well.I'm a little doubtful that our secret courts won't be able to handle this development. They could argue that *not* putting up the canary message violates the gag order. Or just heavily imply it, and imply that there will be consequences if the cat gets out of the bag in any way. The fact that we have secret courts at all makes this kind of plausible to me. Where should I go for this sort of news though? When something like this happens, it tends to get filtered out before it hits my news cycle or front page or whatever. So when people smell gas after seeing that there's (as I read it) no warrant canary in Google's newest monthly report, what site should I be tuned into to be on top of that news? [serious]I would assume, if something big enough as Google getting hit with a gag order came to light, it's going to do so in a rather big way. You would have to assume that Google would only be served a warrant if someone was looking for something specific. If it becomes a raid style situation, I would bet my house on the fact that you'll find out.shiiit"
"i work at a marketing company in NZ and a email was sent around today COMMANDING employees not to upgrade their company issued ipads to IOS 8."
"if we did we would face disciplinary action...We got the same thing... but working for the IT dept here I know the reason isn't malicious.   They simple don't want a shit ton of support calls when every apple device that gets upgraded needs to be re-added to airwatch mobile device management (assuming air watch will even work out of the gate).If it's anything like my work, they told us to hold off to make sure there's not anything that needs to be patched in iOS 8 first, security errors, errors with our company apps, etc.  In like a week they'll probably say it's all good to update.What happens if the the gov't threatens to fine them $250k a day until it got access like it did with Yahoo?Apple can afford that for a good 10-20years without breaking a sweat$250k a day is $91million a year, and Apple has nearly $100 BILLION in cash reserves, they could pay it for a thousand years solely on that.Yeah, but the fines doubled every week.If that's the case I'd just run it out because by week 30 you're over 130 Trillion dollars which is just doctor evil laughable as it exceeds the GDP of the entire planet.I'm doing something similar with student loans... Cept the fine doubled weekly. [Except that the daily fine for Yahoo was set to double for each week of non-compliance](http://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/2gli8t/after_just_203_days_yahoos_fine_from_nsa/)[deleted]You read the link?"
">On devices running iOS 8, your personal data such as photos, messages (including attachments), email, contacts, call history, iTunes content, notes, and reminders is placed under the protection of your passcode. Unlike our competitors, Apple cannot bypass your passcode and therefore cannot access this data. So it's not technically feasible for us to respond to government warrants for the extraction of this data from devices in their possession running iOS 8. The real thing is, is all that data sufficiently encrypted? I suspect that it isn't and that having physical access to the device would be enough to get around the 'passcode' in the same way that one can access the entire contents of a Windows computer by booting it off a linux live CD.Would it be so hard for people like you to go read Apple's security whitepaper instead of making blind guesses (that are wrong) about how security on iOS works?[removed]> A whitepaper merely says what Apple could do. "
"So... now your contention is that Apple is actually lying about the way iOS security works?"
"Really, that is your argument that you are right? A conspiracy theory?"
">What if the new iOS updates the modem firmware so that your passcode gets stored on the modem where the NSA can easily download it via 3G? There's all sorts of creative ways to leak data."
"So... yes. A conspiracy theory. Apple has put in a back door for law enforcement."
"Essentially your argument is based on not trusting Apple when they say how iOS works."
"Or in other words... it is based on nothing.Cunningham's Law: The best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question, it's to post the wrong answer.All iPhones are hardware encrypted. You cannot brute force the passcode using an image of the iPhone. You must have access to the physical device.I would add to this that your passcode is salted ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography) ), most likely with some unique ID associated with your device, when used as the key to decrypt your data. In other words, a 3rd party like the government wouldn't be able to just try all combinations of 4-digit passcodes to decrypt your data.> *Apple* cannot bypass your passcode and therefore cannot access this data"
"Does that rule out decryption with a private key that only the NSA has?So it's not technically feasible for us to respond to government warrants for the extraction of this data from devices in their possession running iOS 8."
"This is so carefully worded as to become meaningless. It may not be technically feasible to extract the data from the devices, but that doesn't preclude the existence of unencrypted data stored on phones nor the existence of server side copies of the data.what this really says is that if you don't download iOS8 and continue running older versions of iOS, you may be fucked because we've been fucking up all this time. Probably; it is most likely another way to force users off older platforms that cost them money to support.Maybe.  It's kind of like this commercial apple made https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnEo82-hFHE"
"In 30 seconds I learned that apple has previously been making shit headphones, but now they got it right. The funny thing is, the earpods weren't any different from the previous earphones, they just directed the sound into the ear canal; where would we be if not for crack marketing?It's still a good thing. There would be different legal standards and processes for obtaining that other data you mention. Whether or not it's a good thing is hard for us to determine; we just need to assume that every company is going to use our data for their own purposes and not get hung up over their verbal masturbation :)> but that doesn't preclude the existence of unencrypted data stored on phones nor the existence of server side copies of the data."
"There is no data on the phone that is not encrypted. "
"And they are very upfront about the fact that LE still has access to device backups and other information stored on iCloud."
"In fact, OP article explicitly points it out as well.That's such a lie.you would praise it if google said something like thatWith Google we could view the source code No, i would question it and people would be able to prove it VERY easily due to the source code being easier to get to.Pretty sure that guy who shut down his whole email site due to government pressure made the same claims. We saw how well that worked out.I'm assuming if you lose your passcode then you can't retrieve your data anymore?Passcode is the code to unlock your phone."
"> Passcode is the code to unlock your phone."
"It's also used to get the decryption key for the flash memory. Once the passcode is gone you can't decrypt the flash memory."
"The other people who have replied don't know what they are talking about."
"Unless you have a backup on your computer or iCloud, if you lose the passcode to your device, you are shit out of luck for getting any data off of it.Pay them in pirated mp3s. You'll be at $250k after a few tracks, if court verdicts are a reflection of true value.Court verdicts are not a way of making you pay the exact amount you stole. If you embezzle a million dollars from a company your not simply forced to pay it back and go on your merry way."
"I'm not trying to say that the amounts aren't absurd for stealing music, however to assume that the fines directly correlate to the value of the mp3's is wrong. I thought the party-line was due to your actions, we have $xxx,xxx in lost earnings for our artists."
"I really want to see how they come up with those numbers, either way.Give the Government a free U2 album?Hey now, we're trying to avoid a fine not increase itAll they're really saying is that most requests are from law enforcement to assist in locating lost/stolen phones. The fact that they can't disclose any information on national security related requests is a gaping hole in the pro-privacy image they're trying to create. The government has used national security as an excuse to hide an absurd variety of things over the past several years, and this will be no different. Right from the website:"
">National Security Orders from the U.S. government."
">A tiny percentage of our millions of accounts is affected by national security-related requests. In the first six months of 2014, we received 250 or fewer of these requests. Though we would like to be more specific, by law this is the most precise information we are currently allowed to disclose."
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security_letter"
"The thing is one request could cover millions of accounts so that number is meaningless.  They could request data for every single Chinese customer for example.  Probably many millions of people, one request.  They could request data from every single account that matches a list of key words for example, or every account in the US that contacted a foreigner."
"Additionally, they say a tiny number of accounts are affected by national security requests.  What exactly does affected mean?  In NSA speak they used this terminology to refer to accounts that are actually accessed by humans, but the millions of accounts that are scanned by computers are not considered to have been searched or affected by the NSA."
"Finally, this statement completely ignores Executive Order 12333 collection which is a huge, gaping, black hole.  It was EO 12333 that allowed the NSA to break into Google and Yahoo servers overseas and copy entire databases.  Basically the NSA can do whatever they want overseas as long as it's part of a legitimate national security investigation.  They don't need a warrant or even prior authorizations and they don't need to tell congress, the public or the companies involved what they're doing and any Americans' data that is accessed as a result is considered incidental collection and is fair game for the full gamut of NSA analysis."
"For all we know the NSA has full access to Apple servers overseas and all our data is routinely scanned and accessed.  To Apples' credit this sort of thing would probably be done without their knowledge, but we shouldn't just trust that our data is safe simply because they say so.Guys, is it so complicated to read an article?"
"It states in font size 80:"
"> less than **0.00385%** of customers had data disclosed due to government information requests."
"Per 100 Million customers this would be 3850 disclosed customers."
"There is also a link on the website for a more detailed report were the numbers are broken down by country:"
"http://images.apple.com/privacy/docs/government-information-requests-20140630.pdf"
"United States:  "
"**4132** - Total Number of Law Enforcement Device Requests  "
"**13743** - Number of Devices Specified in the Requests  "
"**789** - Total Number of Law Enforcement Account Requests   "
"**1739** - Number of Accounts Specified in the Requests  "
"So yes, one request can cover more than one device/account.   "
"But no, it is not probably millions but only a factor of 2.That number may not include data disclosures that are under a gag order. You simply can't take these numbers at face value.Interesting.  I work in computer forensic for a law enforcement agency (local level).  Any passcode-protected iPhone after the 4S, we have been unable to bypass, and even if we did it would not matter due to encryption.  If it was 4S+ we would write a search warrant and serve Apple Corp with it.  The waiting list to have Apple bypass the passcode was/is about a year.  I have heard they only have one employee servicing these SW request."
"Now, I can only relate to this from a local level.  I have no clue how the three-letter agencies interact with Apple."
"I'm all about protecting peoples rights, so lower your pitchforks!  Prior to SW being required to search a cellular phone incident to arrest, I was pro-SW being required.  I'd rather someone search my house, than my computer and cell phone.  "
"This is HUGE news, it's step forward for privacy and set an example for other companies.[deleted]If you believe them you are as dumb as they think you are.[removed]>According to leaked documents, the NSA claims a 100 percent success rate when it comes to implanting iOS devices with spyware.

"You do realize that for that exploit to work the NSA needed physical access to the device? And it was patched when discovered.[removed]Come on seriously, that article is lousy even for the Huffington Post."
"And the Daily Dot article makes explicit that the access spoken of in the article comes from the NSA putting their own software on an iPhone, not from Apple's software.[removed]Why are you so butt hurt?

Doing that's also pretty immature.Yea because the DOJ cant [Strongarm Apple like they did Yahoo](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/09/15/you-think-youve-got-bills-government-could-have-fined-yahoo-trillions-of-dollars/)The proof is in the pudding, or in this case, the nature of iOS 8's encryption methods. The difference is Apple literally can't give them the data even if they wanted to. They try their damned hardest not to have access to your data at all. For example, iMessages are stored encrypted on the server (and Apple obviously doesn't have your private key), and now iOS 8 stores all local data encrypted, so Apple has no way of unlocking it without your knowledge. It should be noted that Android can be configured to encrypt your local storage as well, but Google obviously has all your data on the server anyway, and can be forced to turn it over.You also can't just blindly believe the best in everyone when the stakes are so high.I hear where you're coming from, but you don't think people have a good argument to be cynical given recent developments in the last couple of years? Why should anyone give any credence to what anyone thinks about the subject when it is clearly a technical matter? The amount of opining and guesswork allowed on the internet is ridiculous. Present some technological explanation for your argument, or you aren't making one at all. You're just flipping a coin at that point. "
"Skip all that, though, far better explanations as to how this encryption works are present in this and other threads. They are far better than the guesswork you are promoting. The National Security Requests were what grabbed my attention. They are forced to comply, and can't divulge specific information on the volume of requests they process. They are effectively saying they comply with most federal requests for phone access but comply with local law enforcement only on a case by case basis. Even then they comply when legally obligated according to this.The NSA isn't law enforcement. They have never allowed gov't onto their servers because the gov't never asked. Instead they showed up and said you'll owe us loads of money and be in jail if you don't let us look over your shoulder.You don't need access to servers if you can monitor all the data going in and out.[Cellebrite.](http://www.cellebrite.com/)"
"The reason Apple receives so few requests for data, is it's mostly not necessary."
"The device is cloned by LEA, all of it.  Forensics tools are then run at their convenience, on the cloned drive.  Most times the encrypted data is not necessary.  LEA uses the forensics tools to prove intent, location, or a synergy of unprotected data."
"Also:     "
"> *...National security-related requests are not considered Device Requests or Account Requests and are reported in a separate category altogether.*"
"Apple doesn't provide the numbers for the national security-related requests either.  No way to know how often a Judge has compelled Apple to release information.  No way to tell what information was released either."
"*Apple, we'll say anything to earn your ~~trust~~ bucks.*The all the relevant OS (maybe not app) data is encrypted using the hardware of the iPhone. Even with an image of the device, this cannot be decrypted. After 10 tries on the device itself, (if feature is turned on) the iPhone will erase itself."
"Apple CANNOT release certain information about NSA requests, but is actively engaging in a lawsuit against the GVMT to release more information. "
"Did you even read the link?> Apple doesn't provide the numbers for the national security-related requests either."
"There's a link right under that nice little circle to their [transparency reports](http://www.apple.com/privacy/transparency-reports/).

"FtfyI don't know if you guys remember Lavabit.Lavabit was a small company that most people hadn't heard of before they were shut down. It didn't take much for the government to beat them into submission."
"Apple, on the other hand, is an extremely large, wealthy, and well known company. They can't be easily pushed around like Lavabit was.That is not how national security ops work. They don't push on companies -- they go to specific employees who have the ability to do what they need, they hand them a NSL that says you can't discuss this with your supervisor, staff, company legal, management, board, spouse or family -- and you can only discuss it with your attorney far enough for your attorney to tell you whether or not this is a legal NSL, you can't discuss with your attorney what we are asking you to do.

Whether this means they are encrypted by default I'm not sure, but would love to see the detail on. But it's a great step to take. Android has offered full disk encryption for a while, but setting it up takes time, and it is not used by many users since it is off by default. Google changing this to default on, or opt-out on initial setup, and to stand with Apple for security, would be a great step to take as well.> this becomes a marketing point"
"If you read [Tim Cook's letter on the parent page](http://www.apple.com/privacy/) he definitely takes a shot at Google."
">A few years ago, users of Internet services began to realize that when an online service is free, you're not the customer. You're the product. But at Apple, we believe a great customer experience shouldn't come at the expense of your privacy."
">Our business model is very straightforward: We sell great products. We don't build a profile based on your email content or web browsing habits to sell to advertisers. We don't monetize the information you store on your iPhone or in iCloud. And we don't read your email or your messages to get information to market to you. Our software and services are designed to make our devices better. Plain and simple. They like to make this claim of non-monetization a strong point, but it is however something we have no data to verify, and somewhat misleading. Notice how he enumerates the service they exclude, and takes pot shots at others like net ad tracking, etc. "
"Quite to the contrary, we know they track your purchasing habits, music tastes, profiles, etc, through iTunes purchases and App store usage to tailor your recommendations and increase sell through. The careful wording here makes it sound as if they don't participate in these practices. But the truth is if they did not, their level of service would be massively inferior by this point. "
"No, the truth is they do monetize your activity and your actions, just not your static data perhaps. Since there is no Facebook/G+ Apple version, they just leave your contacts be. To that extent, I don't really think Android, natively, monetizes afterwards. Only were you to use google plus, and contribute to public profiles via public reviews, would they benefit in that way by sharing those reviews with not just contacts, but explicitly approved friends. But if you are just syncing contacts on a Google Account without a G+ profile, no.

"Google also doesn't build personal profiles based on email content or web browsing. Their adwords system is tailored message by message, and this has been covered extensively as for why it's automated and safe. As for and web browsing habits ...yea that's BS. You can use any browser you like, cookies from hundreds of organizations are still tracking you. Apple included, just maybe not directly."
"Again, I do think their statement here, and the choice to encrypt/protect these pieces of content is good. But the digs from the letter are just petty and distract from what they are complicit in. Which is what it's intended to do I guess.> Quite to the contrary, we know they track your purchasing habits, music tastes, profiles, etc, through iTunes purchases and App store usage to tailor your recommendations and increase sell through."
"This sounds like you're actually making a point until you look at what the words actually mean."
"Yes, Apple keeps track of things that *you buy from Apple*.  If you go to the iTunes store and buy Superman, Apple is going to know.  There is no way for Apple to sell you Superman *without* knowing, since they have to, you know, send it to you. All vendors do that, and it's not particularly controversial.  The library can tell you what books you have checked out, as far as that goes."
"What makes Apple different from Google, etc., is that Apple does not have access to things where you are not specifically asking them for something.  If I send you an e-mail, Apple can't read it.  If I send my mom a text, Apple can't read it.  That's the difference, and it's a huge difference.  "
"No one cares that you bought superman."
"A lot of people might care about what you put in an e-mail."
"How quickly we forget Ping!Here's a summary for many of the comments here: I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY SAY! THEY'RE STILL WORKING FOR THE NSA AND THE POLICE! DON'T TRUST THEM!"
"As usual:"
"Complainers: Don't trust them, they decrypt your data and turn it over to the police under court order. "
"Apple: You're right, so now we're going to remove the ability for us to decrypt your data, your data belongs to you. "
"Complainers: We don't believe you. We wanted you to change it, but we will never believe that you changed it. We want proof, even though we'll never believe this proof. No matter what you do, we'll always move the goal-posts.That's one of the reasons why what the NSA did is such a big deal; it's much easier to lose trust than to rebuild it. They made true what in the past was only deemed plausible by conspiracy nuts; in order for US companies to regain the consumers' trust they need to do something proportionally extreme, and not just put out a note in PR speak pretending to claim it's all better now.This really pisses me off about reddit."
"If you don't believe it, do some research. Half of reddit doesn't even know what encryption isApple could cure cancer and /r/technology would find a way to bitch about it.In all seriousness, how long until the government makes them provide a backdoor?Who needs a company to intentionally place backdoors when governments allocate ungodly amounts of budgets towards hire swarms of security research teams to find exploits that the corporations and security teams are unaware of? ie: StuxnetI'd be amazed if they didn't already have one.  It's not like companies are allowed or willing to tell everyone about their government ordered back doors.The NSA already has backdoors & root access to any and all apple products allegedly Microsoft too.."

">Our business model is very straightforward: We sell great products. We don't build a profile based on your email content or web browsing habits to sell to advertisers. We don't monetize the information you store on your iPhone or in iCloud. And we don't read your email or your messages to get information to market to you. Our software and services are designed to make our devices better. Plain and simple. [...]"

"Here is an [Article by ars technica on the subject](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/09/apple-expands-data-encryption-under-ios-8-making-handover-to-cops-moot/)"
"According to the article, Messages, Mail, Calendar, Contacts and Photos are protected by AES-256 encryption (info: [1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard),[2](http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/2251/how-secure-is-aes-256),[3](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18847580/aes128-vs-aes256-using-bruteforce),[4](http://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/1x50xl/time_and_energy_required_to_bruteforce_a_aes256/))"
"Also The passcode is entangled with the device's UID, so brute-force attempts must be performed on the device under attack presumably, the encryption key is generated using the devices unique ID, meaning that to make a feasible brute force of it, you would have to have physical access to the device."
"Of course, if you use the default 4 digit passcode, its far easier to break into assuming they have physical access to the device, but this can easily be changed to a passcode of arbitrary length using the full keyboard for the full protection."
"Since this encryption key is made using your password, it is not stored with apple, therefore they can physically not access it (see AES info) To them, the data will appear random."
"Where this goes with iCloud is anyone's guess once you choose to put things up there, but since that information can be accessed by signing in online using your apple account, it's stored in a form that CAN be read by apple - so if you want your stuff secure, don't sync it over iCloud and use the cable instead."
"On the other hand, what you should be angry about is their new iBeacon. Basicly, apple made a new MAC address randomising feature to stop you form being tracked through public places using your wifi and MAC address (info: [1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address),[2](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/06/ios8-to-stymie-trackers-and-marketers-with-mac-address-randomization/),[3](http://www.itworld.com/it-management/336828/attention-shoppers-retailers-can-follow-you-around-mall-way-web-trackers-do-onl)). Now they are putting their own proprietary tracking system into their phones to monopolise phone tracking (info: [1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBeacon),[2](http://www.zdnet.com/what-is-apple-ibeacon-heres-what-you-need-to-know-7000030109/))"
"(Feel free to correct me if there's something I'm missing)>Also The passcode is entangled with the device's UID, so brute-force attempts must be performed on the device under attack presumably, the encryption key is generated using the devices unique ID, meaning that to make a feasible brute force of it, you would have to have physical access to the device."
"This requires the device to be jailbroken or booted up with a special ramdisk which only works AFAIK on the iPhone 4 or older devices only."
">Of course, if you use the default 4 digit passcode, its far easier to break into assuming they have physical access to the device, but this can easily be changed to a passcode of arbitrary length using the full keyboard for the full protection."
"You can set the device to wipe itself after 10 attempts and if you use the Mobile Device Configuration Utility you can set it as low as 1 attempt before the device wipes itself.If they truly cannot access my data without my password this would mean if I lose my password, Apple cannot reset it and let me back into my data."
"Is this the case? Wouldn't Apple warn us not to expect recovery if this were the case?You can use 2 step authentication an password recovery tools. But that is always an issue. People can then phish it from you."
"There isn't a magic bullet for this yet. This is an issue every company has. At least Apple devices are coming out with really good and really fast biometrics. That is a step int eh right direction.> You can use 2 step authentication an password recovery tools."
"How? If Apple can send my password to me, then that means they had it all along and could have used it to decrypt my data. They claim they can't do that, that it is actually impossible for them to decrypt it."
"> At least Apple devices are coming out with really good and really fast biometrics. That is a step int eh right direction."
"I love TouchID, it is fast and good. But it doesn't produce a secret key or password from your finger. It can only convince itself you are you. So you ask it to verify you are you, and it says yes, it's him. Over the net this is useless, there is no way to verify that the phone isn't lying and just saying you're you.Apple's 2-step recovery has a rescue key that they give you when you set it up. If you lose that and your password, you're boned."
"As for TouchID, I don't know for sure, but I assume that the secure enclave can work like a smart card. So your fingerprint is just unlocking that; the enclave could have a private key.The website linked actually is referring to the passcode on the iOS Device. Apple has no way of knowing what your passcode is and if you have forgot it then you will lose everything unless you have previously synced it with a computer. You can then only use that computer to recover your data."
"http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1212"
"By password it sounds like you're talking about an Apple ID/iCloud account. Which is a different issue, obviously Apple can access data stored on its servers and when required by law to give information over can do so.  Props to Apple. Unfortunately this is important in the version of America we live in at the moment."
"Wait till they get the Yahoo! treatment.What's the story about Yahoo?http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/09/15/you-think-youve-got-bills-government-could-have-fined-yahoo-trillions-of-dollars/?tid=rssfeedthey were going to be fined $250k per day if they didn't comply with the nsa.IIRC, Yahoo! was fighting the government over server access, but was under a gag order about it - they weren't allowed to tell anyone that it was happening.How did the news become public then?the gag was for yahoo employees, yahoo terminated one and told them to blab. from what I've gathered.The whole point is Apple literally can't turn over the data even if strongarmed, since they don't have access to it. The difference being that Yahoo had all of your data on their servers unencrypted (since their entire business model--like Google's, Facebook's, etc.--is based on having access to your data).They have the data that is encrypted. The NSA won't have much trouble getting around your 4 digit passcode.Except it locks you out after 10 attempts and it can also be set to wipe your data after that 10th attempt as well. No, they cannot brute force your 4-digit passcode.iOS allows for up to 37 characters with 77 possible alphanumeric/symbol characters in passcode.Up to.My name is moses89 and I say things with out knowing the factsAll the facts are on the Apple website. They literally dodge around the subject by claiming they can't un-encrypt the data. Do you have any idea what the NSA does? Code-breaking is what they do if you can't use Google.I was more pointing to your 4 digit remark. It doesn't matter, there is no evidence to suggest the NSA is capable of decrypting 128 bit encryption, which is used by iMessage, which supposedly takes 1.02x10^18 years to crack if you used a supercomputer.Ok, all the flaming aside, I have to confess I don't understand why the 4-digit code is secure. I understand that the real decryption key is 128-bit, but wouldn't brute-forcing the 4-digit pin give them access to the key?"
"I'm not trying to feed the flames here, I would genuinely like to learn about the other protections in place to prevent this. If you click the link on the top left that says Privacy Built In it tells you more. As far as I am aware, iMessage is encryped with AES 128, and apple doesn't have access to the private key to decrypt it in transit, which means the only way it is decrypted is by either of the users devices. If a government agency wanted to access the message in plaintext, they would have to access your device, and the only way to do that would be through your passcode, which they could brute force I suppose, but I believe they would need to actually physically have the device. "
"I could be very wrong, this is just my understanding.Ok thanks for the info!"
"Just curious does anyone know why they went with 128? I thought 256 was the current standard? Can't they reset your password if you happen to forget it? Couldn't they get access that way?Not if you enable 2 factor authentication. They give you a key that if you lose your trusted device that key can unlock your info. If you lose that key and your trusted device... to bad, your data is lost.That's more reassuring.They can't turn over this data; what makes you think that this is the data they would be turning over?What makes you think NSA hasn't backdoored the encryption Apple is using now as well?Because what you just said isn't even a fucking coherent sentence."
"Backdoored the encryption is something that... just isn't a thing. AES256 which is the standard for Apple (it might actually be stronger now but since ~2007 that I know of) there simply isn't a way to brute force it. You cant get around it, and if you knew a lick about encryption you would know this.Other than from their word, do we really know that is what they're using?"

"If there is a backdoor, you don't need to bruteforce it, that is the point of a backdoor."
"And even if they are indeed using the best cryptography possible, that means nothing if the key is leaked. And besides, your data needs to be decrypted on the phone for you to access it, who knows what else is running in there?Well once you tear the operating system apart and don't see any evidence of anything running in userland (where it would have to operate for information to be sent out without your consent) it becomes evident that it's not a lie Couldn't they for example have a separate system hiding inside the chip packages, sniffing the RAM and sending commands to the modem and stuff?"

Anything that can be done, can be undone. Period.From the article, Our commitment to customer privacy doesn't stop because of a government information request."
"Really....because Apple initially denied compliance with the Government request for information, then fought to keep their actions secret, and now they seem to be trying to hide their compliance....."
"It's interesting that the 'new normal' is that we have no privacy at all, and it's out of the ordinary that a company can 'no longer decrypt X for law enforcement'.Other companies try to build a profile about you using a complete history of everywhere you've been, usually because they're targeting you for advertisers. Since our business doesn't depend on advertising, we have no interest in doing this -- and we couldn't even if we wanted to. <<< Google burn.Honeyypottwell, who's gonna do it then? it's not like only apple can hack their own devicesFYI - Mobile Carriers are required by law to provide access to their networks with intent to listen to phone conversations and other information called Lawful Intercept aka CALEA. There are standards written to allow this access built into the machines that transport your voice/video/data. So just assume that Govt. agencies have access to your data if they want it. "
"Here's some brief public info - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawful_interception"
"Don't put anything in electronic form that you wouldn't want the Govt to  be able to see, nothing is completely secure not even the Govt's own data.If they're still backing up to iCloud, what's the point?Apple did something I agree with!You have absolutely no reason to believe Apple or any company for that matter."
"They are in business for themselves, they could give 2 turds what you dislike as long you keep coming back for more;  lies or not.Gotta say, I'm impressed. I'm glad to see this kind of thing happen, and I hope others follow suit. It seems pretty similar to Mega. "
"If you ask me, the only way to create a safe and secure future is to make it impossible for government actions to go undetected.lol we can no longer decrypt for law enforcement.  Which is why we've built in a back door so they can do it themselves.  They don't need it when everything is backed up on apple servers.Not sure if I understand this."
"Does this imply that photo's, messages, etc will be encrypted on the I cloud servers under your personal phone password also?  Isn't that where the celeb photo leaker accessed those pics?The celeb leaker used phishing emails, brute force, and weak users passwords to enter the accounts It was a failure of general password security, not iCloud specifically. Also some of the hacked celebrities used Android phones. Many people believe that these photos were obtained by many many different people over a long period of time and shared in small hacking circles. One of those people int he circle leaked a large portion of the collection. No real details are known because nobody has been caught.Thanks for the clarifications.  I hadn't followed the details of the celeb leaks.All I know is that 4chan guy did it. I'm pretty sure he was a sys admin.But who is this 4 chan?I bet he deleted system32 to make his computer faster so he could hack all that stuff so quickly. He could have just downloaded Google Ultron... so much simpler!They can no longer decrypt iPhones for the police .... But the NSA still can.

Unlike our competitors, Apple cannot bypass your passcode and therefore cannot access this data. So it's not technically feasible for us to respond to government warrants for the extraction of this data from devices in their possession running iOS 8."
"This is very unspecific. What do they mean 'cannot bypass', and by what means did they have to 'bypass' it in the first place before iOS8? "
"Not 'technically feasibile' just means it's 'formally' not available, but it doesn't satisfy nor meet completely their assumed need of the user's privacy. An example of informal feasibility in this context is: Apple having remote access can still access the user's data when they decrypt it either into temporary or volatile storage. In order for the user to secure their private data, assuming this passcode is an encryption key, from remote view by Apple is to not view the data at all on the device, making it a very poor platform for privately held information.less than 0.00385%"

They have no desire to see what you're searching for, your email, your location, etc. They wouldn't even want to pay for the server space to store that, since it's literally useless to them."
"It's in their best interest to do what users want (which in this case is privacy), since users are the ones lining their pockets. Google, Facebook, etc. depends on advertisers to make money, and so, they depend on having access to as much of their users' data as possible.

"You didn't account for it being presented as %."
"The 0.2 probably comes from the rounding factors invovled.Shouldn't the encryption be so robust that they couldn't do it without a password anyways?So can the government request the encrypted data and then unencrypt it themselves? If they have access to RSA keys, it makes certain schemes easier right? > If they have access to RSA keys, it makes certain schemes easier right?"
"What keys are they supposed to have access to? The public keys, sure, but that doesn't help much.How many comment without even reading the article. The title here is not 100% what is written there.Am I naive for thinking that Apple really has been making a 180 as a company lately?Yeah, yeah. And if we will have new Swoden we will learn that they actually can and do.Can? Or Will?Can.Kind of a huge difference, no?Yeah now law enforcement can do it themselves. Edited it in. Thats all great and dandy, but law enforcement will go to your mobile carrier first anyway.  Verizon/At&T have all your info the gov want to see, and I'm pretty sure they dish it out quite liberally. Of course they won't, they'll give the software to do it to law enforcement. Apple won't technically have to duo anything.This appears to be good news, although I admit I am skeptical that there is some non-obvious loophole in these carefully chosen words."
"Also, just because user data on iOS 8 is encrypted and protected with a users pin doesn't mean Apple can't be ordered to cough up the encrypted data along with a key protected by a pin that in most cases is <6 digits. They could also be ordered to start logging all users pins tomorrow and wet would never know. I'm not saying this happens or that if I was the NSA this is even the best way to acquire this sort of data, buts it's just food for thought. Don't most people keep their data in the iCloud anyway?So law enforcement can still tap into transmitted data but can't obtain perviously sent data. Am I understanding that correctly, Ebounding?Yeah and I'm never going to masturbate again..."
"If someone asked apple they'd do it.But how about 4chan?Suddenly, the Congress approves Huawei to sell their equipment in the US.> So it's not technically feasible for us to respond to government warrants for the extraction of this data from devices in their possession running iOS 8."
"Not technically feasible is not same as can't.  And if Apple can't, that doesn't mean someone else can't.What basically Apple says is  we can not decrypt your device unless it's NSA request >  National security-related requests are not considered Device Requests or Account Requests and are reported in a separate category altogether."
"..."
"> So it's not technically feasible for us to respond to government warrants for the extraction of this data from devices in their possession running iOS 8."
"So will they be responding to National security-related requests?  Will it be feasible then?Glad to see its in, at least its a step forward, i know the boss will be happy to be able to say that at least :)about dam time, they should of NEVER been able to in the first place. I can't wait for a year or two from now to find out there were NSA and law enforcement back doors implemented in the code all along. It's ok everybody, the Police will just have unlimited attempts to guess your password instead.Apple might not be apple to decrypt the iPhone but NSA still might be able to decrypt it...I knew there was a reason I wasnt comfortable with snapchatI wonder if apple can yank this page when it turns out the government can access iphone 8 data.This doesn't do diddly squat to protect your iOS device [from this forensic software used quite often illegally by police.](http://www.accessdata.com/solutions/digital-forensics/mobile-phone-examiner)How do we know they didn't get one of those secret court orders forcing them to advertise this while leaving a gaping backdoor for the NSA and shit?Apple: Quick, upgrade to ios 8, it's more secure .... silly consumers, after they upgrade we can decrypt everything now, mwaahaha, they'll be none the wiser... oh crap the keyboard is still on!In addition, Apple has never worked with any government agency from any country to create a back door in any of our products or services.... Yet they have had a backdoor up until IOS7?I'm sure that this is VERY hard for Apple to do....*sarcasm*."
"If law enforcement is trying to hack into a phone or account, then the provider will add a backdoor to their iOS update.  It's not Apple's responsibility, nor has it ever been their responsibility.  It's naive to think that Apple is doing anybody a favor. Let's see what [these guys](http://www.cellebrite.com/mobile-forensics/products/standalone/ufed-touch-ultimate) say about that.  Apply might not be able to decrypt the phones but that doesn't mean that nobody else can...Apple schooling the world in marketing yet again, well done.Will they cave like blackberry did? Their early claim to fame was security but in order to sell phones in India the government required access. After a short standoff BB handed over the keys. Hopefully the political climate is different now and apple will stand firm. Also, hopefully they're not just lying about it.Don't the carriers still have most of this data themselves? lol sorry apple I don't believe you. I would love to. but no. can't the US government has you by the balls and will make your life hell if you don't provide back door access to your customers. the best you can do is Lobby to have the Infringing laws abolished.National security-related requests are not considered Device Requests or Account Requests and are reported in a separate category altogether."
"Okay, so there's giant loophole #1.> Unlike our competitors, Apple cannot bypass your passcode and therefore cannot access this data."
"Ummmmm Blackberry has been like this forever. I'm pretty sure that Android's storage encryption is the same if used properly from the device only standpoint...."
">So it's not technically feasible for us to respond to government warrants for the extraction of this data from devices in their possession running iOS 8. "
"The caveat being they don't need to extract the data from the actual device if the data is stored remotely on iCloud, or your apple e-mail account, etc. They do have the ability to decrypt and present those under demand of warrant.Bullshit>If we are legally compelled to divulge any information and it is not counterproductive to the facts of the case, we provide notice to the customer ***when allowed*** and deliver the narrowest set of information possible in response."
"It doesn't matter what Apple believes or promises; the flawed legal system makes their promises irrelevant.just don't put your shit in iCloud FTFY"
"We can no longer decrypt iPhones for law enforcement but we will decrypt for politicians. Everyone seems to be pretty tickled about this, mostly because there's some assumption of malice on the part of law enforcement..."
"About a year ago, working with my department's computer crimes investigator, we were able to arrest and convict a rapist based on data obtained (with a search warrant) from his iPhone.  The phone contained inculpatory evidence including pictures and text messages.  Without this data, it's unlikely we would have been able to give the victim the solace of knowing that we had captured the person who had violated her."
"So just keep the other side of things in mind.  This is the sort of thing that could get me to go back to iPhone. Except by the time it's time for a new phone, it'll be industry standard. But thanks, Apple! /r/digitaleagleWow, this might make me finally purchase an iPhone.Your turn Google I call bullshit. No one is allowed, by law, to admit to helping law enforcement when the government claims, without evidence or warrants, that it's a matter of national security."
"In addition Apple was forced to admit they have a backdoor after denying they have one.  "
"Denial: http://mashable.com/2014/07/22/ios-backdoor-security/  "
"Admission: http://www.zdziarski.com/blog/?p=3466  >less than 0.00385% of customers had data disclosed due to government information requests."
"The scary thing is that at 300 MM iphones, that is still 1,115,000 customers who were affected - yikes.Your math is of, its 11,550Where as I think this is a good step, it's really just a hurdle, they could brute force their own system if they really wanted to, even if they've locked themselves out.These warrants from law enforcement are scary, and americans should worry about them and demand further transparency.  "
"I used to work for an online web host and would handle such requests from various local law enforcement agencies, and agencies such as the FBI and Secret Service.  These agencies would request all emails and personal information we had on file for the customer.  The worst part however, was that we were explicitly denied from notifying the customer that we were handing over their personal information and emails to the government."
"Americans need to demand more freedom for companies to notify customers when they give out data.800,000,000 ios devices in the world.  .00385% of that is 30,800. Thats the high number if each device represents a customer. "
"However if each Apple ID represents a customer, Apple has 500,000,000 Apple ids out there of which would be 19,250 information requests would have been complied with. "
"Thats a lot of legally valid information requests.And then millions of murderers used iPhones to avoid prosecution.what a load of crockheard this crap before. They all crumple once uncle sam's black op thugs swing fees around. Or they'll just break in.Remember that one time Apple wouldn't unlock a dead mother's iPad for her sons who inherited it after she passed?"
"They really do want to take your secrets to the grave.Not feasible does NOT mean impossible just not easily doneThe other reason why they can no longer decrypt the devices is because of Apple Pay. Decrypting the devices would give law enforcement access to social security, checking/savings account & routing numbers, pin and security codes, AND fingerprint biometric data/metadata."
"That would be a fucking shitstorm of apocalyptic proportions for Apple, as that's a violation of SO MANY different privacy laws, it would bury the company."
"I mean sure, the government via various agencies and the NSA respectively, already has all that. But this is a private corporation and they don't have sovereign immunity. So they can't and won't decrypt devices, they like being a corporation that can make money; they don't want to be a bankrupt agency.What's really important here is that the company that essentially kickstarted the entire mobile web doesn't make pages that are usable on a phone...  :P"
"Wait.. So Apple are good guys?And in iOS 9 the decrypt ability comes back. Along with a gag order forbidding mentioning it.That yellow wet substance that is wetting your head, it's rain, honest.Sounds like they have still processed quite a few law enforcement requests, just shy of 20,000 (500 million iphones sold times 0.000385 disclosure rate equals 19,250) Funny how math can mask things.OK, so for those who don't know how to read statistics/numbers, that percentage is out of all devices. When you look at the numbers where data were revealed out of the number of requests, it's a much different story."
"In the U.S. 83% of the requests got some information... "
"http://images.apple.com/privacy/docs/government-information-requests-20140630.pdfThat's awesome! I don't think anyone 5 years ago could have predicted that Apple would emerge as some sort of privacy vanguard, but it's increasingly evident that their attitude is significantly constructive to the cause of personal electronic privacy and security. TLDR?CIA FBI NSA, No problem in fact already done and indexed for you - here you go.If only they had a service so I could get those deleted mails back after I accidentally delete them.  ...^but^please^ignore^the^icloud^backups.As someone who moved away from iPhones for many reasons and has never looked back...color me interested.Apple will still have the ability -- and the legal responsibility -- to turn over user data stored elsewhere, such as in its iCloud service, which typically includes backups of photos, videos, e-mail communications, music collections and more. Users who want to prevent all forms of police access to their information will have to adjust settings in a way that blocks data from flowing to iCloud."

If anyone believes this, I have a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you.lol ok.Welcome to the party says BlackBerry.Actually a pretty fucking awesome phone. Too bad people don't even bother to try it out. don't think there is much of a party at Blackberry"
"Their party has everything you want, yet no one shows up. The socially awkward phone.They still cooperate with the NSA howeverPeculiar how anything not Apple friendly is being downvoted to shit in this festering boil of a thread.Unverifiable claims. But nicely kerned. Okay, I trust you."
"That page of weasel words was so much easier on the eyes than an auditable source code repository.  Thanks, Apple!No worries, the nsa will decrypt it for you,  no problem. Bullshit.  Who could ever trust Apple?  Oh, we just decided that we don't like that previously approved app that you spent 3 years developing because we decided to start developing something remotely similar that might be part of a future update so we're going to remove it from the AppStore without warning.  Sorry!Bullshit."
"Major tech companies are required to provide NSA backdoors through security due to secret FISA court rulings.Shiiit.  I think I might have gotten the wrong phone....... unless they installed facebook.  But that's facebook's problem, and no longer apple'sIphone...a crimelords phone."
"Jokes aside it's a nice step forward.Yeah right.Bullshit.  "
"They're saying they can't to appease their customers, but that doesn't make it true.That's great for marketing.  Tell folks their phones are finally private.  I've seen folks jumping at buying an iPhone because of this fact.  But... iCloud is still accessible for these information requests.  I can't really speak to how often folks back their phones up to iCloud, but I do see Apple pushing for more iCloud integration, so information is still available for requesting."
"Apple says that 7% of requests are made on iCloud/iTunes and the rest on devices.  Well if law enforcement can't access a device, what in the hell do you think the next step they're going to take is?"
"Another thing, they classify national security requests under a separate category which doesn't impact the numbers shown for requests.  What qualifies as a national security request?  As ambiguous as the NSA and other intelligence agencies are with their reasoning for investigating folks, who knows how to interpret that.  Why *wouldn't* Apple use that to their advantage in a marketing campaign?"
"So why does Apple address the public formally about device encryption and specifically mention device request statistics?  It's to show the market that law enforcement has a huge need to get into your devices and there is now a way to protect yourselves from this threat.  iOS8.  More sales for Apple!  Meanwhile, they progressively integrate more cloud features to your phone that *is* accessible to law enforcement *but* law enforcement has to pay for each request.  More revenue for Apple!"
"It's deceptive to me.well if some random shmuck can hack into thier servers for some nude celebrity pics im sure the government can come and go as they please.. good try apple.. your just as stupid as your customersYou're*Do you pride yourself on being ignorant or is it purely natural?Good thing they can't, then.The celebrities photos got out most likely through them having stupid passwords and even more stupid account recovery question answers, not an actual hack.I guess this is just like how Apple fans think that their computers are Virus ProofThey certainly do have much less malware than competitors, that probably helps too.Thank you for sharing this.They can't, but someone else can.Prove it.The last time they did this, someone called them out. I'm sure all the three-letter agencies are still able to.iPhones are encrypted?Some data on them, yes. It's complicated; there are several levels of security. Read the white paper they did about it.WeKey word law enforcementWhether it's a lie or not. They could lie and still have nothing to worry about if found out. Too big to fail. Anything short of their products becoming sentient and killing the buyer wouldn't be enough to sink Apple.BSHang on, Starting with iOS 8? Just recently I heard Tim Cook claim that Apple never decrypts anything for the government. If this new claim is true, then Apple is full of shit.Plot twist, it's because the government can do it themselves. Honestly, itsounds like a bunch of propaganda to get you to download iOS8This doesn't matter- Apple is a willing participant in NSA's PRISM, so this is a hollow, meaningless gesture to lure users into a false sense if security.Twist: they canDoes anyone actually believe this?[deleted]A tiny percentage of our millions of accounts is affected..."
"Percentage is singular.Unless the NSA asks them to.SureWe believe youThey say, knowing full well their security procedures are as difficult to break as a 4 year old wet paper bag.This is a bunch of doubletalk/marketing garbageApple's Cupertino facility bombed by crazed right-wing terrorist"
"Apple announces it will continue to decrypt iPhones for the US government, reversing previous decisionI wouldn't be surprised if this is just all smoke and mirrors from Apple to get people to trust their products. Apple: That'll help them forget about the iCloud episode.jennifer lawrence loves thisApple - helping the terrorists win since 2014."
"/s?The ironic thing is google has been doing this since its launch. As soon as you have a password lock there is no way of breaking though it. There is a story of police trying to break into a pimps phone to uncover a prostitution ring but even the police couldn't do it.This just in, ISIS confirms they will be getting the family plan for 5,000 devices running iOS 8 Do you believe this? Of course you can't Apple /wink.If one believes in apples advertising, they will believe this bullshit, too."
"Even if apple did not install any government backdoors in this release, NSA, FBI, CIA, and other three-letter-agencies will knock down the proper doors in Cupertino and see that such mishaps won't happen again."
"Apple is in no way more secure than other US-based companies. It's the law, obey or else.And, like in every professional police state, the companies get gag oders, so neither the victim nor the public will ever know how the government abused its power.I get a sliight feeling you either didn't read or don't understand the article.I read it. And I call it bullshit. When the feds bang at apples doors, apple *will* provide. And, as per order, won't tell the customer. Apple may be snotty, but they are not above the law, and they want to stay in business."
"When they are ordered to provide back doors and shut up about them, they will do. And they will definitely not advertise this.>We have also never allowed any government access to our servers. And we never will."
"For sure they will allow access to information when coerced through CALEA and other court orders. Given their post-Jobs track record, I'd imagine information will be turned over when presented with NSLs, FISC orders, and participation through secret gov't programmes will also continue. Don't forget apple participated in the PRISM program. Not allowing access to our servers doesn't necessarily exclude copying information from our servers to servers owned by other entities. Basically, what I'm saying is don't trust privacy by policy, trust privacy by design. And don't trust companies with track records of privacy violations just because they preach privacy rights when they're in vogue."
"Edit:"
">The most common requests we receive for information come from law enforcement in the form of either a Device Request or an Account Request. Our legal team carefully reviews each request, ensuring it is accompanied by valid legal process."
"Which process(es)? And defined legally by whom?"
">All content requests require a search warrant. If we are legally compelled to divulge any information and it is not counterproductive to the facts of the case, we provide notice to the customer when allowed "
"So, content requests require a warrant, but metadata..."
"Oh, pretty please, can we notify your suspect, [insert agency]?"
">and deliver the narrowest set of information possible in response. National security-related requests are not considered Device Requests or Account Requests and are reported in a separate category altogether."
"Considering the vast majority of (unconstitutional) bulk data collection occurs under National Security requests, much more information is needed about such requests."
">On devices running iOS 8, your personal data such as photos, messages (including attachments), email, contacts, call history, iTunes content, notes, and reminders is placed under the protection of your passcode. "
"Wow. Such protection, much security! What percentage of users use a four digit PIN? Definitely the vast majority. Seems pretty trivial to pull that data down and brute force it at the government's request."
">Unlike our competitors, Apple cannot bypass your passcode and therefore cannot access this data. So it's not technically feasible for us to respond to government warrants for the extraction of this data from devices in their possession running iOS 8."
"That says nothing about the data apple already has and continues to collect on you. That also doesn't prevent any remote attacks from a gov't agency to get additional content."
">A tiny percentage of our millions of accounts is affected by national security-related requests. In the first six months of 2014, we received 250 or fewer of these requests. Though we would like to be more specific, by law this is the most precise information we are currently allowed to disclose."
"So, we can't know how many users are affected by theses requests, as they are usually not individual requests. For all we know it is 250 requests for information on 10 people or 10,000 people."
">less than 0.00385% of customers had data disclosed due to government information requests."
"The number looks good on its face, but is an information request classified as device/account request or the seperate national security-related request or both? "
"I'm a bit skeptical and perhaps cynical, but that's only the case because the constitutional violations of the gov't that were only able to take place with collusion from companies like apple.> So, we can't know how many users are affected by theses requests, as they are usually not individual requests. For all we know it is 250 requests for information on 10 people or 10,000 people."
"Looking at past transparency reports from Apple and also from Google, it looks like the number of accounts affected is generally in the same band as the number of requests, or in the next band up. E.g., Apple reported for the first six months of 2013 0-249 requests which affected 0-249 accounts."
"Google is similar. They have gotten 0-999 requests in each of the last 11 six month periods. For 7 of these periods, those affected 0-999 accounts. For 4 of those periods, 1000-1999 accounts were affected.Android phones have encryption as well do they not? It has to be enabled from the settings menu.Not by defaultThere's always a way....Does the word no longer imply that they admit that they used to?They used to be *able* to.Give us a backdoor or we're changing the rules on offshore banking.Don't change the rules on offshore banking"
"Or we'll stop our campaign financing/r/hailcorporateHaha I'm calling bullshit on this!I wonder if this will be the job of the *carriers* now and this is just apples way of saying well it wasn't us"
"The carriers can't unlock your device. They don't have the access to the OS like that. I don't know if you understand how this works...All well and good for the consumer of Apple products but it comes at the cost of toxic work conditions for the Chinese factory workers and toxic environments for the towns nearby.Yeah because it's not like Foxconn makes anything for other major companies. Just Acer, Amazon, Blackberry, Cisco, Dell, Google, HP, Microsoft, Motorola, Nintendo, Nokia, Sony, Toshiba and Vizio."
"But shame on Apple specifically! Shame on them for picking the manufacturer that makes almost 40% of the worlds consumer electronics.Yes, shame on a company that puts profits above the working conditions of it's laborers!Because it's not like Apple asked the Fair Labor Association to audit their suppliers or anything. Oh wait... Wait they did: After enduring weeks of criticism over the working conditions at the Chinese factories that make its products, Apple has asked the Fair Labor Association to look into the matter. [link](http://gizmodo.com/5884585/apple-is-letting-auditors-into-its-horrible-chinese-plants)From your own linked article, Apple notes that it has conducted more than 500 audits of its own facilities since 2006, including 40 audits at Foxconn plants."
"Either way, the point I was trying to make to your original comment was that it's not only Apple, so why should they take 100% of the blame? "
"I don't see people posting comments like yours in every Microsoft/Google/Sony/Nintento/Whatever thread. Just Apple.So they farm out the encryption to third party which hand the key to the government instead of  apple. So you cant sue them when the  government get your data by mistake?  Are we clear now? What it actually says We admit we decrypted iPhones for law enforcement prior to iOS 8. Now you should trust us to not do this any more. And yes, everyone who cares - will trust. Nah not rly.. Why should I believe them? They have lied before. The only way of ensure trust is through transparency. > They have lied before."
"Do elaborate.Snowden revelations.All terrorists will now switch to the iPhone 6/6+.  Interesting way to gain some market share!  Apple wins.Clever. Get people to buy into iOS 8 because ppl will think their shit is encrypted/safe. Wait, this isn't /r/funny. Don't tell me people actually believe this crap.Well you sure provide compelling reasons not to with this statement.When it comes to matters of security, the burden of proof that your software is secure lies with the software creator, not the user. Apple uses proprietary software, therefore it is impossible to prove that their software is insecure. Therefore I wouldn't trust them when they spew a load of crap like this with 0 evidence to back it up.What a load of crap this statement is..."
"Essentially they have said that they only comply with Legal requests as much as required (as most companies are required to do), except where derr homeland security is concerned which falls under a different category and they can't tell you anything about..."
"So, most large companies already have this lip service.It sounds like they are specifically referring to no longer being able to unlock phones (that have a passcode) or bypass the passcode to access data.  However, the passcodes are only 4 digits...not exactly the strongest encryption key you can have.  Or am I reading this wrong?1. The 4 digit passcode is only allowed something like 10-15 attempts, after which it completely locks your device. This you can of course strengthen/decide yourself, but the default option is the one that matters most since that is what 99% of people use."
"2. The encryption key itself isn't the 4 digit passcode, it is a randomly generated string. This means authorities can't use a [chip-off](http://www.forensicswiki.org/wiki/Chip-Off_Forensics) facility to get direct access to the storage and just brute force the encryption key.You can have a complex keyboard passcode. You don't have to use 4 digits.And also Touch ID.Long password + Touch ID is the best . You only have to enter the long password after device restarts, which for me are very rare.After a few failed attempts it locks you out of your device. There is even an option to wipe it after 10. Brute forcing a password, or even 4-digit code becomes very impractical if you only have 10 tries [Speaking of brute force](http://xkcd.com/538/)Honeypot.BullshitWhat about all the maps data that apple has on its users?All the data they collect is anonymous. They don't know who they are getting it from.You cannot [find your parked car](http://9to5mac.com/2014/06/09/hidden-ios-8-assets-confirm-apple-working-on-maps-feature-to-find-your-parked-car/) with anonymous data. Apple stores your GPS coordinates, indexed by your unique ID in apple's cloud. That isn't anonymous by definition (anonymous means being unable to correlate data to a user). Ohh last i read it was anonymous. Oh well. Cool thanks for the new info! That's because LE already has the ability to decrypt on their own, so Apple no longer needs to do it for them. PR win for Apple but no substantive change.[deleted]600 millions users x (0.00385% / 100) = 23,100 users data breached?>data breached"
"I think you mean data disclosed. Breached is a word that would be referred to non-law enforcement entities like hackers or phishers.Distinction without a difference.No. I pretty much made it clear what the difference was. "
"The distinction is that breached means something is broken or has failed."
"Data being disclosed means there is no technology failure, just a human one. Depends on whether you wanted your data disclosed or not. The name of the receiving party is irrelevant.Why should we believe them?Or so they say...wait wait, they could do it to begin with?In the same way that Dropbox could turn over your files and so forth. Technically possible (if subpoenaed, for example) rather than we do it when bored at lunch.So now all they have to do is hack into their iCloud account to get nudes?"
"yes yes I know thost account were breached by guessing security questions etc. Oh sure apple Can they at least encrypt icloud so nobody can steal any more pics from celebrities?That's not how the pictures where stolen.I dont need facts, only headlines will do.I'm sorry, but law enforcement will still have access to your phone records.

Woot!I love how this sub reddit acts, you'll pick up on such details that i would personally miss in other cases, but when it comes to Apple? You believe their every word... There's some fine wording there as others have pointed out.

"I'm specifically pleased that they don't harvest my data to sell to an advertiser so I can then be targeted. They can take that position because they're not dependent on that revenue for their profit. They make their profit selling their hardware. I'm all for that."
"I like to know I'm buying a good-quality product that the maker also works hard at to protect from outside influences. To me that is very important added value. "
"Eddy Cue said that Apple are not interested in what I buy, who I buy it from and what I pay for it. Apple provides the feature, keeps my data safe and doesn't look over my shoulder to take notes. Apple is the polar opposite of the telcos that can't be content to just be the pipe, they also want to dictate what you can and cannot do with it."
"I'm not saying I agree with everything Apple does, but when they try their best to make a great product, don't throw me under the bus with regards to my data and they communicate clearly and openly about that, I don't know how you could hold that against them."
"I feel a lot more at ease with the idea of buying an iPhone 6 now. Bull. Shit."
"I full expect to see articles in a few weeks/months detailing backdoors, unauthorized trackers, and oops exploits built into the OS, much like every edition before it.Do elaborate on the backdoors there has been in every edtition, that don't require physical, unlocked access to the device.Haha, fat chance. Too little too late. The trust has been broken. Any company/government can say whatever they want and no one should take their word for it.  The only solution now is decentralization and open source. Still waiting on a secure, privacy-oriented, open-source mobile OS unfortunately. Hopefully one day. Android is open source, but it is also a privacy nightmare in many respects. Just look at their issues with permissions.'Hey. Good news, guys! We no longer have that back door built into the operating system.  You know, the one we never mentioned.  Really. I promise. You can trust Apple with all of your sensitive data.  What's that? Oh, right the photos. Well, with the amount of data we store we're a huge target. Once we have your credit card information stored,  no one will be interested in hacking us anymore. I mean, we're not nearly as big a *target* as some companies are.'"

Don't sit here and complain when you're the one throwing personal stuff on a phone which you know will be compromised.Sounds like a load a shit to get people to update to IOS  8 and degrade their phone's performance. Still leaves iCloud for them to hand over...Load of bollocks. If they're asked they have to do it no it or but Are they done backstabbing us for every penny by making us buy new chargers for every phone we get?   Ridiculous.  I have friends now who come over and can't charge their older Iphones.  Money grubbing bastards is what Apple is all about.> We protect your privacy and data. Oh wait there is this little bug here that allows someone to brute force iCloud and the script is posted on github..."
"2 weeks later:"
"> Now we *really* protect your privacy and data and give you this free U2 album."
"Facepalm.They won't willingly hand over your information to law enforcement, but they also won't code it well enough to keep it safe from an angry/horny hacker. I can certainly sleep better at night now.That was about phishing and bad passwords."
"This is different. If you want to learn more about their actual encryption you can [read this](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4865?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US), but you will probably just ignore it and repost the same closely held convictions in another post.No, actually I'm super down to give this a look, thank you.Does this mean if we don't update we're fair game?They can't?"
"Hopefully they won't give unlimited attempts to others who want to try.If apple gave up the guys gps information we could have prevented those additional 30 murders. Also, I love how they say unlike our competitors directly attacking all other brands, which is funny because of all the faults in their security recently. If you try to access my phone more than 10 times it resets everything. Only 2 people know the passwords.[deleted]Yeah, no doubt.> If apple gave up the guys gps information we could have prevented those additional 30 murders"
"They can already get that from operators through cell tower information. AT&T doesn't even require a warrant https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-2014So devices are encrypted using the 4 digit pin code meaning Apple can't decrypt any data upon request? Uh... 4 digit pin code...I use a 10 letter password, personally.You can set an alpha numeric code from settings in place of the 4 digit pin, plus we know that the encryption is salted with the devices unique ID, so you would need to physically have access to the device in order to decryptThat's the point, you *would* have access to the device. The whole post is about Apple not being able to assist in helping access devices in possession of certain agencies."
"Yeah you can set alpha numeric codes, but my point was merely stating that for the majority of users, they use a 4 digit PIN, which when you have access to the device and a minimal understanding of the iOS Security model (which intelligence agencies do), it can be subverted.Well, anyone at risk of getting their phone taken from them for some reason should know about this risk and protect themselves anywayYou can set up the iPhone to reset everything after 10 failed attempts. Even when that isn't configured it'll add a delay after a certain number of failed attempts to prevent brute-forcing."
"Since iOS 7 you can no longer access the device storage over USB without trusting the computer which can only be done when the phone is unlocked."
"So the only way to brute-force it would be to unsolder the flash chip and dump the contents, and then use a copy of the encryption code to brute force the dumped data. Well within the reach of the say, the NSA looking for Snowden. Too expensive for local law enforcement. And easy for Apple to claim we don't have the equipment for thatw/I have tried this many times but I found some interesting story from http://freaksense.com/2014/09/apple-ios-8-released-review-downloads/| less than 0.00385% of customers had data disclosed due to government information requests."
"http://www.statista.com/statistics/232790/forecast-of-apple-users-in-the-us/"
"63.2 million users in 2014. 63.2 million x .0000385 = 2,433.20 users they gave up data on."
"Edit: Me do math bad.Next time, try to multiply by 0.0000385.[deleted]What hackers?I'm pretty sick of companies shoveling this shit.ITT: EVERYTHING'S TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE, I'M A LONE SURVIVOR IN A FOREST OF WOLVESI don't believe it. If an ISIS member with a phone in the US is hatching a plot Apple won't let the police into it. Of Course they will, the down side of the publicity would be so large they would loose a lot of profit.  OK so you are not a virgin any more at it, now how about something less headline grabbing. Sure they will, but what will the police do to extract data from the secure enclave/element? We're talking about hardware lockdown here.Wow.. That apple has the balls to put up a page like that is blowing my mind"
"Go apple!Too little, far far too late.Too late for what? In what way too little?Hell yeah! Let the crimes commence!Didn't a tech-savvy user find iOS 6 sending your entire contacts list to Apple surreptitiously? "
"That didn't help Apple, imagine what there WATCH is collecting and sending (to who knows who).....because there have not been any recent data leaks involving Apple... They don't need to decrypt anything the NSA already records most of the information contained within the device. Yeah right...BUUUULLLLLSHHIITTTEEESick cuntsTIL: Apple does exactly what every other company does with LE search warrants.  Great PR stunt!Since the cats out this is what you say now Apple.I don't believe them.Have you all already forgotten the Snowden leaks? The things you all circlejerked about for so long?"
"Apple has a backdoor in their fucking OS. They aren't the good guys. They can't decrypt for law enforcement because they don't need to. The data is already in an NSA server the moment your iPhone/iPad/OSX creates that data (if it's connected to wifi/3G, and even when its not I'm sure there is some sort of limbo for the data to wait in until it's able to be sent back to HQ.)...but your pictures..? Yeah, they're fucked."
"#fappeningIn iCloud, yes, they're fucked."
"In your phone, no."
"Be careful where you store things.Exactly. I've never trusted cloud-based backups, and never will. My data is MY data and I will always store it locally on external HD's or whatever. I don't like the idea of my data being out there on some nebulous server.Are you fucking kidding me, the multi-billion dollar company that MAKES the device can't bypass a 4-digit pin code? Even if you use the long password method, there are jail break tweak that can do that and a huge company can't?Bullshithttp://replygif.net/i/242.gifIf you believe this, you're a gullible fool.Ok, so <technology company> says they are protecting our privacy. Leaked information later reveals that they were lying. <Technology company> then says, we're not doing that anymore."
"How do we know for a fact this is true? I mean, if they can put an album on your phone without your permission, how do you know they can't read whatever they want on it, whenever they want, or give that permission to whomever they want."
"Sorry, but until they give me control over the device and its security, I refuse to trust these kinds of statements anymore.Oh well, it's not like the NSA doesn't have a backdoor anyway. And it's not like they can easily look up any non encrypted information ever sent from your device. Oh wait, they can...While I absolutely commend Apple for this move, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Apple still maintains encryption keys to iCloud backups, which they can be compelled to provide given a warrant.  So all that's really protected here is any information NOT in iCloud backups. That's way less than what this circlejerk is excited about. In fairness, android encryption has been undecryptable by google from it's very inception. Apple can no longer decrypt the phone For law enforcement."
"thats not the issue"
"The issue is that the government has a MASSIVE surveillance network tha all that information about anyone around the globe with listening posts everywhere."
"your personal information being encrypted on there servers means nothing if the network itself is comprimised."
"And it matters little because again im relying and trust apple to protect the product."
"The only way to know if a device is secure is if it can be opened up and its code and hardware examined."
"apple and all closed source vendors are essentially asking you to have faith that there is not a backdoor. "
"remember all of apples statements might not be true if they government is compelling them otherwise,"
"I cant trust apple or any vendor that wont let the user actully look at the code they write for there product im trusting my information to hold."
"Plot twist: we won't have to. iOS 8 streams all your data through our servers before being encrypted.The Police can Just look into your phone they don't need permission from apple. Heres what they use to do it. Scary stuff.. http://www.cellebrite.com/Bullshit.Law enforcement has tools now, they don't need apple to decrypt. calling bullshit"

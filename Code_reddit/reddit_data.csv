"Apple loses Slide to Unlock patent in a lawcase at the German Supreme CourtGermany getting it right.I find that Germany's usually on the sensible side of things. apart from that one timecome one we are allowed some small mistakes as well There are, naturally, some exceptions to that. Those include the lack of marriage equality, some aspects of the otherwise accomplished school system (mainly that the pupils have to specialize into a field at a very early age), lots of low-paid part time scam jobs, and redundant bureaucracy in a lot of societal services.> lack of marriage equality"
"Maybe because thats the opposite of the sensible side of things."
"Marriage is a privilege, granted to heterosexual couples, and this is the way it has always been meant to be and as that it makes sense. There is no point at all in publicly supporting private hobbies like homosexuality."
"always been meant to be - any proof for that? Marriage is a human social concept, and thus it can be adapted to modern social humans."
"Homosexuality is as much a hobby as heterosexuality. And before you bring up the but they can't have children point, infertile heterosexuals can't either.But they can have children. "
"Your argument doesnt invalidate this point at all because in most cases you dont know of the infertility beforehand. I personally know several people who had been diagnosed as infertile, yet later they had children of their own."
"And even if your point was valid, there would still be no reason to grant special privileges to homosexuals. It would be a reason to deprive infertile couples of these privileges."
"Okay, let me rephrase that: do you think that infertile people who knew beforehand and will definitely not have children (because of removed parts of the womb or whatever other scenario you can think of) should be disallowed to marry? If your answer is no, then you have to admit that having children is not the sole purpose of marriage, which means this argument can't be used against granting homosexuals equal rights in this regard."
"And it's not special privilege. You might not have noticed, but the western world agrees that marriage is not solely for children - it is simply a bond between two people, and for that, their gender is completely irrelevant. Marriage is a human concept. It can be adapted by humans. It doesn't have to stay the exact same, and it hasn't. Why would 2 people who just want to live together need special public support?"
"Its the raising of children and the stability of a family thats the hard thing to deal with for young couples. Also, marriage was always meant to create a special bond, create a high threshold before divorce, to give the children the couple creates more life security. "
"None of that qualifies for homosexual couples or heterosexual couples who dont plan to live together to become a family."
"It doesnt even make sense that homosexuals want to be married in the first place. I think its just a childish me too cry, and maybe a political move to make those opposed to this demand somehow look evil. They just wanna have, too, what those guys have. Nanny-state problems."
"You didn't answer my question. Should definitely infertile people be banned from marrying?"
"The state encourages two-person relationships through marriage not just for the benefit of potential children, but to encourage the bond itself. Two people living together means less bureaucracy and a better tax situation. The state wants to encourage that. It's not simply because they might have children. "
"What, it does not make sense that people want to have the same rights as anyone else? Again, heterosexuals can marry and then proceed to never have children, and the state does not punish that. Why should that not be allowed for homosexuals? Not to mention that there is still adoption as a way for any couple to raise a child. "
"EDIT: Also, if you think this is a nanny-state problem, why not abolish all state-benefits for marriage? That would end any involvement of the state into the institution of marriage.> You didn't answer my question. Should definitely infertile people be banned from marrying?"
"Of course. Its purely academic though because those cases are very rare. "
"> The state encourages two-person relationships through marriage not just for the benefit of potential children, but to encourage the bond itself. Two people living together means less bureaucracy and a better tax situation. The state wants to encourage that. It's not simply because they might have children."
"Good points. A first in many of this kind of discussion. "
"private hobbies like homosexuality"
"*I like skiing, watercolors, and fucking dudes.*"
"Yes, that's totally what homosexuality is, a hobby..."
"Keep your definition within your religion, and let society choose a definition that leads to greater stability and happiness for its members.> Those include the lack of marriage equality"
"Only inequality left is the name and that gay couples have to adopt serially, but can't jointly. The latter thing is a legal detail arising from the way the current law was made (by decision of the constitutional court, they never sweep broadly but only address the matter at hand) the former... meh."
"Expect the whole thing to change as soon as we get rid of the conservative government."
"> some aspects of the otherwise accomplished school system"
"Schooling is a state matter. Many states are actually fixing it... and no, Bavaria isn't Germany."
"> lots of low-paid part time scam jobs"
"Well, our welfare system got its name from a [convicted criminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Hartz)."
">  and redundant bureaucracy in a lot of societal services."
"Not so much redundant as bizarre, a lot of that has to do with different levels being responsible for different things at different times, and untangling that mess (e.g. if you're on ALGII you get welfare from the federation, but the municipality pays your rent)."
"And the BA is especially bad, you can be glad if they actually apply the laws at hand and not interpret them as they bloody please. > lots of low-paid part time scam jobs"
"Cutco? > ... lack of marriage equality ..."
"Well you have to blame the CDU (Christian Democratic Union) for that. But to be honest I am fine with that, they don't change it for easy popularity and stay true to their ideology.Their school system sounds better than America's everyone go to college, get a liberal arts degree, now complain you don't have a good job to pay back your loans At least they're students, from what you implied, are trained for something productive. Plus, going to university doesn't put you in debt.Which is offset by higher taxes. I dunno, is it? Student debt in the US seems pretty crippling from what I've read about it.Only by people who shouldn't have gone to college to begin with. Government trying to ensure everyone a college education and this 6 figure American dream life is the issue. Some people don't have the drive and motivation but they're told they can have it. They go to college for a bull shit degree and get stuck with debt, rather than just learning a trade and making a solid 50k/year. But isn't the cost of a degree high across the board?In nominal terms yea. But in real value no. Not to forget censorship + GEMA> Not to forget censorship "
"There is no censorship. It's just that companies have to censor themselves to remain in the market. The Prufstelle fur jugendgefahrdende Medien checks media (films, books, games, ...) and marks certain media as not being suitable for everyone under 18. If that happens, you are not allowed to advertise them, which makes it nearly impossible to sell them - including making online sale impossible. Therefore, everyone censors their media to not fall into that category, which leads to the impression that there is censorship in Germany."
"Youth protection in Germany is out of hand and completely broken.Uhm not really. You can advertise them. Many games such as GTA 5 are Rates AS 18+, but still advertised. There is something else like extreme violence (Gore like) vor showing banned stuff (mainly swastikas) gets censored and them games you buy in germany are altered, such as swastikas in Wolfenstein are replaced. In movies swastikas are allowed however, cause movies are considered Art, Video games are not. "
"Gore is censored more  in germany, but nudity is censored less. "
"Another thing is indexed media. This can't be advertised or shown open in stores. But it is legal to sell to people over 18, just have to know about it and find a seller.Calling an immense pressure to self-censor not censorship is only technically correct, though. Actually, it's even worse for companies, since with videogames, altering content for individual markets is costly - the state *can't* censor it because of the nature of videogames, but they force companies to spend their own money to do it.There is no such pressure.There is no such pressure - is this a joke?"
"The state says either you censor that (at your own cost), or we will bar you from any and all advertising and your product will only be sold under the table, it will not be displayed in the store and that's supposed to be no such pressure?"
"For many products, that is a death sentence. Well, then you shouldn't make such a product.So you think it is absolutely fair to restrict some artforms and not others? To make it legal for movies to display Swastikas, but not for videogames? To ban materials, not because of any actual danger they provide, not because they contain recipes for homemade bombs, but simply because the state judges the inhabitants to be too fragile to cope with it? "
"We have a 18+ rating. Why not slap that unto these works? "
"Do you actually have a point, or do you just want to be contrarian?They don't really force it; it's entirely voluntary on the part of the companies."
"If they want to sell in Germany, they have to comply with German norms and laws, yes. But it's not like they're forced to sell in the German market. That's entirely their choice.As I said, calling an immense pressure to self-censor not censorship is only true by the letter and not by the spirit."
"My point is that this law is pointless, archaic and unfairly targets some artforms over others.But there is no pressure to sell in Germany; therefore there is no pressure to self-censor. It's all voluntarily."
"I don't disagree with you, but it's important to point out the difference. Censorship is illegal in the constitution, while applying this kind economic of pressure isn't.Yeah, damn! If only i were allowed to buy KZ-Manager! Censorship? You mean, having to be 18 to buy ultra-violent media?"
"[deleted]/r/watchpeopledie is blocked here."
"...I don't see the downside. And confiscating my swastika trunks :("
"Yeah, if it isn't banned altogether.Can you give some examples of media that were banned altogether, as opposed to having their display and sale restricted to adults?The Wolfenstein franchise for it's depiction of Nazis, Carmageddon because of gore, Mortal Kombat...again, gore."
"http://www.blood-is-red.de/mw/index.php/Liste_indizierter_Spiele"
"these are games on the Index"
"index [B] is for games that are verboten from sale. you are allowed to own it, but it is illegal to sell or display them publicly, and the german customs may confiscate it if you try to import them"
"it's technically not banned altogether, but effectively it isCool. Assuming that site is accurate, that's finally some concrete info on the games that are still on sale and the few which aren't."
"For example:"
"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kategorie:Indiziertes_Computerspiel"
"For some of those games a censored version was created to get approved in germany. Others like Manhunt are banned altogether."
"Okay, so we're talking about all of 18 games that were actually prohibited from being sold, according to this:"
"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kategorie:Beschlagnahmtes_Computerspiel"
"All the other games can still be sold. You can walk into a shop and pick them up.And that's still censorship. How many do they have to ban so that you acknowledge it? "
"And yeah, you *can* go and get them. But they aren't allowed to be advertised or shown in the store, meaning it's unlikely you know what to ask for to get it (although that has become less of a problem due to the internet and general bi-lingual capabilities by the new generation). "
"It used to be so harsh that those games couldn't even be *reviewed* - I remember vividly that an outlet reviewed Return to Castle Wolfenstein under the name Back to Castle Dogrock or something like that.The complete list is not public, but you can send a request to the bpjm to ask if a certain title is on the list, which means it is impossible to know the complete list (except you ask A LOT)."
"Except of those 18 games, there are probably a lot more games, films, music and other types of media on this list.Manhunt was shit so they were just saving you time and money. that's what my friend said, too"
"even an edgy little 14 year old like him was bored by itI see you are not a fan of computer games, not a recreational gamer.    "
"[Just Ctrl+f german and read up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regionally_censored_video_games)"
"A significant number of games aren't mentioned because red blood had to be replaced with green goo, etc.There's only a single game mentioned as being banned on that site, and according to its Wiki entry:"
"Therefore, sale to minors and marketing the original version of the game were prohibited throughout the Federal Republic of Germany."
"So, no, the game isn't an example of media being outright banned.Weird. At least Manhunt, Silent Hill:Homecoming, Dead Rising, should not be available in Germany. Probably some technicality, that means they're not outright banned, but are prohibited from distribution..."
"And all the german altered versions."
"It's not as simple as ultra violence for under-18."
"Edit: nice downvotes. Not only is my post contributing to the discussion, but is in fact absolutely correctTo be fair some things are actually banned, not just on the Index.No, more the whole List B, where media is isn't allowed to be advertised or sold directly over the counter if it is on the list. This *kills* the product, thus the company *has* to either censor it to their liking or completely leave out the German market. "
"This has been a problem especially for videogames, which are still not acknowledged as art by the government, meaning that while movies are absolutely allowed to show, for example, a Hakenkreuz, a game that does this is immediately switched to List B.>mainly that the pupils have to specialize into a field at a very early age"
"Well fields is a bit of an overstatement here. There are three tiers of school. The upper you take if you want to go to university, the middle if you want to learn a trade and the lower if you want to be without a job for the rest of your life. (that last one relatively recent development though)"
"But it's not like you can't move up after you are done with school. After I was done with the middle tier I did an additional two years of school, got the degree that makes it possible to go to university, which I then did."
"Still our school system leaves a lot to be desired, I agree."
">redundant bureaucracy in a lot of societal services"
"Do you have any specifics? Haven't really seen any redundancies anywhere.The lack of marriage equality is pretty shameful, though. It amazes me that we're so far behind on that. Thanks, CDU!I used to think Lebenspartnerschaft would give pretty much the same rights and it was just a name thing ... But apparently, it doesn't protect one of the partners from being expelled from the country after their visa runs out. WTF?And I think it takes some steam out of getting proper marriage equality because it makes some people think that the current state is already good enough... Well I think it's just a question of time, but how much time is the question.> redundant bureaucracy in a lot of societal services"
"well for me the Familienkasse sends 2 letters every month, at the beginning and end, always asking the same questions regarding my studying at university. You would think they got the message that I am still studying and will be for the next couple of years after answering nearly 20 letters over half a year...This school system is also mostly the one we use in Holland, you are placed on a certain level of school which usually exist out of five different ones,  but you can also move up and down depending on your performanceit's the same in germany"
"after primary school, you usually get 2 years of probation to see if you're in the right school and get placed up or down accordingly"
"and after 10th grade of the middle tier school, you can go on to the top tier if you so chooseFirst Walmart, now this. Plus they don't have speed limits on autobahns. I'm almost ready to pack by bags. tldr; driving on the no-speedlimit autobahn in Germany is extremely stressfull."
"No speedlimits on the autobahn is a negative for me. I have been driving thourgh Germany many times. On the autobahn its incredibly stressfull to drive. Big trucks still have a speedlimit of 90/100 km/h and you naturally wanna go past them since you are normally cruising around 120 km/h. But if you wanna go past you have to be extremely cautious before you switch lanes since there are people coming in 200 km/h just swooping past you. Once I cross the border into Denmark or the Netherlands it is so much nicer because everyone is driving about the same speed.It's not stressful at all. The slow driving busses and lorrys drive on the right while the really fast cars drive on the left. If you don't want to go that fast but still overtake the slow vehicles just drive in the middle.> Big trucks still have a speedlimit of 90/100 km/h"
"It's 80km/h! Some buses have an exception for 100km/h, but other than that, everything heavier than 7.5t has an 80km/h speed limit.Yeah.... Germany has plenty of big box stores like Walmart already. Depends where. Most of the roads can and do have speed limits. And basically anywhere they *can* institute a speed limit at times if traffic/weather/etc necessitate it."
"Made the drive from the northwest of Germany to The southeast not too long ago and there were speed limits for 80% of it. Also lots and lots of traffic.As someone who just moved to Sweden and rarely shopped at Walmart in The States, I miss that place so much. It's nice when there's a couple things you need and you have no clue which little store sells themDude. Tall blondes with blue eyes who love to drink. At first you're like OMG OMG OMG then you're like I wanna go home, my head hurts.I was born in Russia and preparedWhat happened with walmart in Germany? [This is not America.

"tl;dr: highly competitive food discounters (aldi, lidl, etc), bad press, german laws and german cultureWatch out for the censorship of any gore, the $1500 drivers licenses and the fact that all grocery stores have to be closed on sunday by law.1500?"
"I wish that would be it. On the other hand: a lot less censorship of nudity, nice cars and fast highways, and less people who have to work Sundays, because all the grocery stores have to be closed by law!nice cars but cost of operating them (tax and fuel) is more than double of that of the US.Also carbon emission tax at ~$1000 US per liter (over 1 liter) per year.Very true. Higher operating cost, much stricter vehicle inspections, stricter and more expensive drivers licences."
"On the other hand: good public transportation, fairly affordable and reliable for commuting, and pretty good options in terms of cost and availability to go on trips throughout Europe without even owning a car!Honestly, no matter how good public transportation is, it is still always utter shit compared to owning a car. I speak first hand experience from living in europe.Also speaking from first hand experience: I really like living in places where it's possible to *not* own a car. Both in the US and in Europe."
"It's pretty great to have grocery stores, bars, restaurants, farmers markets, public swimming pools, parks, sports venues, movie theaters, etc. all in walking distance, or easily reachable via public transportation. It's pretty great *not* having to drive around for 20 minutes every day looking for a parking spot in the city. It's pretty great living in a place that is built around pedestrians and bicyclists, not around car and trucks. It's pretty great *not* getting stuck in rush hour every day. It's pretty great being able to go out with friends, have a couple of drinks and not worry about who has to be the designated driver this time."
"Don't get me wrong, I like having a car, I like road trips, and I like driving. As long as it's an option I have, and not a daily nuisance that I have to endure.> It's pretty great to have grocery stores, bars, restaurants, farmers markets, public swimming pools, parks, sports venues, movie theaters, etc. all in walking distance, or easily reachable via public transportation"
"Yeah, that is great (I currently live in a place like that in england) but then comes the time you gotta buy a fucking TV or some office chair and then you're utterly fucked carrying the damn thing the whole distance. And then there's craigslist/gumtree. Haha you wanna buy a nice cheap TV or fridge from there without a car? NOT HAPPENINGI know. Always sucks. You're pretty happy with your daily life, have everything you need on a daily basis around you without having to bother with maintaining a car, paying taxes and insurance, refilling wiper fluid, changing oil, rotating tires, or paying through your nose just for a new battery... and then you want to go on a weekend camping trip, and it's just completely impossible because there's no way of getting to that particular place without a car!"
"I've used Zipcar in the past, and those are pretty great where they exist. If they existed in more places, were always available and only required a 5 minute walk to pick them up, I think I'd live happily without ever owning a car.There isn't a speed limit per se, but there definitely is a suggested speed you can go."
"I *think* if you go faster than that and something bad happens it's considered entirely (edit: partially) your fault. "
"Plus, it's a highway. A busy place, depending. "
"You're not necessarily going to be able to bring out your sports car and let it gallop.Actually, you can exactly do that. Sure, a lot of sections of the Autobahn do have a speed limit, but it's not unusual at all for people to go 200+ km/h on the unrestricted portions.Last time I visited Germany I had no troubles going as fast as my rental could (~125mph) and being overtake by much faster traveling Audi/BMW/Mercedes. German here. There are speed limits on about 50% of the Autobahn, ranging from ~~80~~ 60 km/h in construction sites to 130 km/h. When there is no limit, the *recommended* speed is 130 km/h. "
"Some political parties want a general speed limit of 130 but the more traditional, conservative parties don't want that. "
"EDIT: Some construction sites require you to slow down to 60 km/h. Might want to read up on a few things. Like GEMA blocking almost half of YouTube it feels and overall censorship of games and stuff. And shameless redditors with their lame Nazi jokes in this day and age.So you guys were nazis right?

Apple is slowly losing multiple of their patents - the rounded corners one only happened a few days ago."
"In this one, it's interesting because under German law patents are not valid if they do not solve an existing problem in a new, innovative way. And this did not even solve a problem, really - it was not a creative solution, it was essentially do what a door bolt does on a computer. No creativity, so invalid. Additionally, they found prior art - from a 2004 Windows Mobile device.> Yup. Apple is slowly losing multiple of their patents - the rounded corners one only happened a few days ago."
"I thought rounded corners was a [design patent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_patent), not a *[utility patent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent)*."
"Design patents (as they are called in the USA) are more like a cross between a trademark and a copyright than a utility patent with the caveat that design patents last far less time than present day copyrights (and trademarks)."
"I'm sorry but it so easy to sit in your armchair and tip the fedora here. Please tell me how sliding your finger accross the screen is not innovative in order to unlock a digital device? Most would have used a PIN. The reality is, for a capacitive screen, a spring loaded swipe switch that doesn't unlock until you reach the end is brilliant. All of these 15 year old engineers and patent gurus on here are driving me nuts. I hope you come up with a great idea one day and someone steals it from you. If Apples idea was so craptacular, why not just make a better one?Apples idea was not crap, but the issue is that it's not patentable if very similar ideas exist before."

"No much wow.As a designer, just because it seems obvious after you've seen it does not mean it's not creative. Often, quite the opposite.How is it not creative  if the entire handheld market followed suit?Because swipe to unlock existed before. Where you would swipe a displayed box into any direction and it would unlock."
"Slide to Unlock only limits this to one direction."
"Saying the same as XYZ, but one dimensional is not very creative or patentable.In defense of the rounded corners patent, it's a design patent in the US which is, by definition, closer to a trademark than an invention/innovation patent. Design patents are, again by definition, nonfunctional, ornamental design choices on a functional thing. Similar, and also protected, design patents include the coke bottle shape. Design patents are much more limited than trademarks, in their need to be very specific (such as radius compared to height and width) and they have expiry dates. Also, as stated, they need to be on a functional item, like a phone."
"It's still arguable whether it's patentable as a design patent, but the whole thing is immensely less ridiculous than what most people think of at the word patent as a new innovation or invention. Rounded corners were by no means completely novel. but before the iPhone or iPod (4th quarter 2001) there weren't corners that rounded that I personally remember.> they need to be on a functional item, like a phone"
"That's a curious thing. I was in an art store and saw a glass statue that was claimed to be patented. I looked up the patent, and it was a design patent on using a laser to crack glass in the particular way this statue was cracked. I don't remember if it was a patent on the laser, or on the artwork, or on the technique, but unless a glass bust is a functional item I'm not sure this assertion is 100% true.A paper weight is technically functional. You can get a design patent on a carpet pattern, possibly wall carpets (read: wall art) as well. I'm not patent lawyer so I can't get into the nitty gritty of the case law, but overall design patents are ornamental parts of things and regular patents are functional. Cracking the glass in a specific way is an ornamental part of a thing of arguable function.OK, cool. I just wasn't sure what functional meant, in contrast to perhaps merely decorative. :-)Functional basically means that the item has some purpose which it could still fulfill just the same if it were designed differently."
"A paperweight could be any shape and still hold down paper. So a particular shape can be a purely artistic choice.The rounded corners patent was originally for the [first generation iPad](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/IPad_1_PSD_Mockup.png/150px-IPad_1_PSD_Mockup.png), which came out in 2010. Here's a [Samsung digital picture frame](http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2006/03/samsungpictureframe.jpg) from 2006."
"There was genuinely nothing original about rounded corners in that form factor at all. Remember a design patent has nothing to do with the purpose, only the visual/mechanical design so it doesn't matter that they had different uses.But Apples design was much more advanced, it describes how the speaker is placed where it always was on phones, and how you can add a button and otherwise nothing else. I particularly like that the patent stresses the nothing else part, and still manages to win in a US court despite no less than 2 logos and 3 buttons added after the do nothing else part. I guess the meaning of nothing isn't quite clear.The coffee table we had when I was a kid had rounded corners, puhh-leez.The rounded corners thing is an oversimplification. But as that shows there are items that still carry many of the same characteristics that make an iPad look like an iPad."
"But despite this, Samsung clearly was not just victims of accidental similarity.  They even made the box look nearly identical."
"http://appleinsider.com/articles/11/08/15/apple_accused_of_faking_evidence_in_eu_ipad_case_against_samsung"
"(see section on the boxes 2/3rds the way down the page)"
"The defense against Apple's claims is that Apple's designs are so generic that you don't have to copy them to have your devices look the same. But there's no way this is the case with the box, Samsung set out to copy the iPad and did.The logic of this one defeats me. They were using the design elements from their own earlier digital picture frame as shown above. You can't say it's a copy of Apple when the design elements in question were stolen from them by Apple. Even if it was quite deliberate of Samsung to emulate the iPad they'd *still* be in the right because they originated those design elements.> They were using the design elements from their own earlier digital picture frame as shown above."
"So that's why the box is so similar in design? Your logic defies me. You just ignore the stuff that doesn't fit your notion?The box is another topic entirely, with different design elements. We were talking about the rounded corners design patent. The design of a cardboard box doesn't relate to this design patent.> But there's no way this is the case with the box, Samsung set out to copy the iPad and did."
"What?? It's a fucking white box. "
"Not to mention the designs and use of the space on the box are fairly different, but that shouldn't matter at all. Cos if you can't sell your product in a white box because someone already sells their product in a white box, then this world is shit.> Not to mention the designs and use of the space on the box are fairly different"
"You have a different definition of fairly different than I do. The other guy linking to the Sony one, I'd say that's fairly different. It has a Sony shape in the corner, different colored sides.* Different projections of product"
"* iPad is extremely minimalist with only a picture of the product and the name on the side; Galaxy contains numerous symbols, with the name of the product on the top and side and a (presumably) specifications sticker on the side, and a green thingamajig on the corner"
"Really not sure what else they could do differently, except use different colours.I'm not saying that they copied the box or not, but it is just a white box with a picture of the tablet on it. I'm quite sure that the iPad is not the first product with such a box. Maybe (probably) Samsung chose it to look more similar to the iPad, but it is still a really generic box.No man, you don't understand.  This is _Apple's_ box.  It is original and unique by default just because of that.  /sThat's kind of a stretch to say they copied the box design.  Lots of boxes have a similar design and Samsung's box definitely has a lot more going on in its design.  If Samsung copied the box design, then I guess Sony did too - http://www.hardwareheaven.com/reviewimages/sony-tablet-s/sony-tablet-s_box1.jpg.  Pretty much every tablet and smartphone are packaged similarly too.  I know my Nexus 7 and every phone I've owned have come packed like that.  Here's the Nexus 7 http://fiddlesaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Nexus7.jpg"
"With a black box in the corner and black sides? I don't see why you think that's nearly the same."
"And the Sony opens conventionally with you opening the side upwards and then flipping the top back instead of the top lifting off as a section like on the Samsung and Apple boxes. Also, it doesn't look identical to the Apple and Samsung inside. It doesn't present the unit the at the top in a borderless presentation, instead it has a sheet of instructions over the pad inside."
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEimjd3nncAThere's nothing original about a box top that slides off.  Lots of products have that sort of packaging (Nexus 6 for example).  The face of the Galaxy box has a logo, floating icons, some green box in the top right corner, a different orientation and size of the product and there is also a ton of writing and labels on the sides that doesn't exist on Apple's box.  They are quite different.  Sony's later tablet boxes have white sides too http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y2NppIyoqnc/maxresdefault.jpg."
"> There's nothing original about a box top that slides off. Lots of products have that sort of packaging."
"Actually, there is. Sure, they existed before Apple, but no, lots of companies didn't use it for electronics until Apple used it first."
"Look at the unboxings I posted here:"
"https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/3ierdy/apple_loses_slide_to_unlock_patent_in_a_lawcase/cug1rb4"
"There is not a lot of floating icons and logos and green boxes on the Samsung box. No a lot of writing and labels on the side that don't exist on Apple's box.So Apple is original because they used an existing packaging type for an electronic device?  Come on man.  I'm sure there are electronics that were packaged like that before Apple's stuff, but I'm not going to waste my time looking for them because you'll just find something else to nitpick or stretch.  "
"And that's a totally different box than what was shown in that first link you posted.  There's a big bright shiny Galaxy Tab logo right on the front of the box.  If you get those two boxes confused, you're blind.  The HTC HD2 box face design is similar to that too."
"Edit:  Still laughing to myself for the it's original because Apple did it reasoning.  Good one lol.I don't see any sane reason why we should act to protect box shape.Thank you. I thought I was going nuts until I finally read a rational thought.Even if purpose mattered, [It's not a new concept.](http://en.memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/PADD)It doesn't have to be original.Hey, someone who didn't say but corners weren't pointy beforehand!111.

"I see you're drowning in KoolAid.iOS was an innovation. It was powerful yet easy to use for non-techies and was miles ahead of its contemporaries.But couldn't send text messages or so copy and paste.... I think people are forgetting just how horrible the first iPhones really were. I didn't use a first gen iPhone, so I can't say how lacking it was or wasn't."
"However, I remember how awful phones were at that time and I appreciate that the iPhone helped push that market forward and break the lock that the carriers had on available phones and features.MMS messages not text messages. But iOS was mere conglomerate of ideas an design approaches invented long before. Novelty thing was composition of all of this in a consistent way - and that's exactly what is claimed above. Except Apple had been developing mobile stuff for decades, even long before the Newton stuff. "
"I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the similar ideas were spawned from Apple's R&D during that time. So just making it up as you go along? >was mere conglomerate of ideas an design approaches invented long before"
"I suppose you don't read novels because they're just a conglomerate of letters invented long before.And you can't copyright claim trope. You can pursuit someone for using your specific implementation, eg. novel word by word, but not the general idea.It was the first polished, consumer friendly version of technology that until then had been very poorly implemented. So they didn't invent many things, but they were the first to do most of those things well. Why exclude implementation from invention? I mean the Wright brothers only really made the plane work whereas people before them did drew up all sorts of barely functional flying machines."
"I feel like the original iPhone's popularity really shaped the industry for all phones that followed. I for one got an iPhone back in the day because my friend let me have a play with his and it was far more responsive than I ever imagined."
"I guess the same thing can be seen again in the recent TouchID implementation. Sure finger-print scanning is old technology, but there has to be some innovation involved in making it as easy and responsive as it is, especially when it's miles ahead of those found in laptops and other competing devices.While you're certainly right, it's also hard to find any idea that isn't in some way a conglomerate of or inspired by ideas invented long before--as is the nature of time.Are you talking about the same iOS that powered the first iPhone devices? The one that did not have a copy-paste in it, and no integration between programs? The one where if you received an email with a phone number and wanted to call it, your best bet was to write it down on a piece of paper and dial manually?"
"Surely they made it great eventually. But when it came out - it was pure garbage. And just to put that in the perspective, contemporaries were J2ME-powered devices, with online stores with games, ebooks, dictionaries and navigation aides."
"The only innovative thing Apple did in iOS was bundling app-store with the OS, so that average Joe can install whatever. Contemporaries required user to actually find a link or a short code to install an app, or usage of an ugly USB cable. >The only innovative thing Apple did in iOS was bundling app-store with the OS, so that average Joe can install whatever.

"That too falls under they made it great later. The app store launched a year after the iPhone. I fully agree that iPhones are excellent devices *now*, but in 2007 they really weren't that great.> It was powerful"
"No, original iOS was a piece of shit. It was completely inferior to Symbian at the time in every functional sense, it just looked pretty.So the web browser was better. All those symbian phones with the capacitive touch screens were better. Oh, were there any?[The LG Prada was announced in December 2006.](http://i.imgur.com/mKroL6E.jpg)"
"It isn't any mystery why LG never went through with their lawsuit.To anyone who doesn't want to circlejerk about how Apple has invented basic shapes:"
"First off, the infamous 'rounded corners' patent wasn't for the first generation iPad. Since design patents are just literally designs and they don't usually contain a description, the first time an Apple patent was described as having rounded corners was when Apple filed a motion for a [preliminary injunction in 2011](http://www.scribd.com/doc/59149837/11-07-01-Apple-Motion-for-PI-Against-Samsung) against Samsung products. "
"In this motion, Apple lawyers describe several designs as having rounded corners. Here is an example of a description of one design;"
">* a flat, clear, black-colored, rectangular front surface with four evenly rounded corners;"
"* an inset rectangular display screen centered on the front surface that leaves very narrow borders on either side of the display screen and substantial borders above and below the display screen; and"
"* a rounded, horizontal speaker slot centered on the front surface above the display screen,"
"* where the rectangular front surface is otherwise substantially free of ornamentation outside of an optional button area centrally located below the display."
"As is immediately obvious to anyone; Apple doesn't claim rounded corners. They claim a design which has rounded corners. The design also has a 'rectangular display screen', or a 'horizontal speaker slot', neither of which Apple claims to own. It would be just as accurate to say that Apple thinks it invented rectangular screens. (as in, not accurate at all)"
"Note that the first time the 'rounded corners' come up is to describe D677, which refers to design patent [US D618677](http://www.google.com/patents/USD618677). Note how this patent itself has no reference at all to rounded corners hence that phrase is solely a lawyers words describing the patent. Note how this patent was filed Nov 18, 2008. There are multiple other design patents all of which are also described as having rounded corners, some filed even earlier. (some as early as 2004, but lets not discuss that one because Samsung was ruled to not have infringed that specific one, but Samsung was ruled to have infringed on designs described as having rounded corners filed in 2007 too)"
"If I compare two cars and say *'your car looks like mine, it is blue, has four wheels, and they are both 2010 fords'*, I wouldn't be saying that all cars that are blue and have four wheels look like my car. Similarly, this one lawyer is saying *'both these phones have rounded corners, square screens, and a bunch of other physical features'*, and everybody is going home with 'the lawyer said that all phones which have rounded corners are iPhones'. "
"The thing is, regardless of the way you describe the designs, it isn't about the description. It is about the actual designs and the way they look. You can describe them however you want and it doesn't affect the actual patent. I could easily describe [this design](http://www.google.com/patents/USD618677) as 'phone with a flat front surface'. This doesn't affect what the patent is and isn't."
"So why does the whole 'Apple patented rounded corners' myth persist? Why isn't it the 'Apple patented rectangular screens' myth or the 'Apple patented speaker slots' myth? When you look at the legal document all of those are basically the same misconception. The thing is, Google/Samsung didn't say 'Apple patented rectangular screens'. [They did say 'Apple patented rounded corners' in PR statements.](http://allthingsd.com/20120824/apple-says-verdict-is-a-win-for-values-samsung-says-its-a-loss-for-consumers/)"
"Here is more information on the [rounded corners myth](http://www.fosspatents.com/2012/09/claim-check-if-apple-patented-rounded.html). To anyone still not convinced, ask yourself this;"
"1. Apple sued Samsung for having rounded corners"
"2. Apple won and Samsung lost"
"3. Samsung still makes phones/tablets with rounded corners today"
"How does that work? Or how about this."
"1. Apple sued Samsung for having rounded corners"
"2. Apple won and Samsung lost"
"3. Everybody else also makes devices with rounded cornersThis is an interesting post... nevertheless, to my knowledge in Europe design patents are granted to unique designs and they have to be shown as unique (which those product designs were hardly). I can't believe there are people alive who actually think Apple invented rounded corners on mobile electronic devices.I don't think there are people who are. I just think there are people who think that calling a specific patent a patent for rounded corners is a vast oversimplification of that patent. If you care, here is [the actual patent](http://www.google.com/patents/USD593087) which is among those which is called the rounded corners patent.> I just think there are people who think that calling a specific patent a patent for rounded corners is a vast oversimplification of that patent."
"That's because people think that having a bezel, putting the button below the screen and the speaker where the ear is is even less worthy of a design patent than the rounded corners.As confusing as this is about to sound, I don't believe anyone actually thinks Apple invented rounded corners. But there are plenty of people who think others think that Apple invented rounded corners. "
"If I recall correctly, the case was more about Samsung deliberately designing their devices to mislead consumers and capitalize on Apple's existing brand recognition. It wasn't We invented this design, you can't use it, it was more, you're intentionally trying to trick people into thinking that's an iPhone.Something to hold in your hand probably should have round corners... like a pebble from the river, goddammit. For those curious, there was actually a pebble phone: [PEBL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Pebl) by motorola."
"Speaking out of experience doing J2ME games until 2006 or so: Motorola is generally quite good at phones, it's always been my second favourite after Nokia. Siemens went under very deservedly, Samsung seems to have gotten its shit together in android times."
"Back in those days... you know, having different chargers for different companies was the norm. Samsung had different chargers for each bloody model. Often they would even fit, but not charge. Pure madness."
"That job experience also made me capable of replacing SIM cards while blindfolded. Which can be rather impressing I'm told, doing it to phones that are ringing in a meeting while simultaneously staring people down. Like a marine disassembling a gun.I had one. It was a damn good phone. The rubberized shell, durability... and the slide to open... It was pretty rare to see others have one though.Is there any info about how TTIP will affect german patent rights?Well the problem I think they were trying to solve, which Jobs said in the keynote announcing the original iPhone, was to prevent it from unlocking in your pocket by accident. It wasn't something that was easy to do accidentally but easy enough to do intentionally. > Jobs said in the keynote announcing the original iPhone, was to prevent it from unlocking in your pocket by accident. It wasn't something that was easy to do accidentally but easy enough to do intentionally."
"Really about as obvious as a door knob that 'doesn't open accidentally but is easy enough to open intentionally'.You clearly know absolutely nothing about design. Things that are simple to understand are not necessarily simple to design. It's pretty fucking hard to make shit up. Impermissible hindsight bias.So much that it spawned a time machine and made Neonode build it years before Apple It was not obvious enough to put on any pocketpc, symbian, or android device that was available prior to the iPhone. I really wish I had that on my pocketpc. "
"Clearly it is obvious now. Aren't some of the best designs the ones that are obvious after they are implemented? Line the Neonode from years before Apple that did it? So very much not already obvious To be fair, the door knob was a brilliant invention back in its day.Before door knobs there was no way to stop doors from accidentally opening in your pocket/r/fifthworldproblemsI carry a knob in my pocket at all timesYour point regarding German patent law is true of, at least, the UK (inventive step) and US (non obvious) as well. "
"A key point is that the 'rounded corners' you discuss was a __design__ patent rather than a utility patent. Design patents (or just 'designs' in Europe) only protect the way a product looks, whereas a utility patent protects the way something works. How the hell do you patent a design? That should be copyright, trademark, etc."
"A patent is fundamentally supposed to be about an innovative way to solve a problem. Not just a new drawing.It's less of a general design patent and more a do not copy law. Eg. Shoes that are made to look like a certain shoe so a consumer doesn't buy a ripoff  shoe while thinking it is the original.Clothing is actually one thing that cannot be patented, the only thing designers can do is put a logo on it which is trademarked.You don't patent a design, you patent an invention :)"
"That being said, IP law grants protection to designers who, provided that the depose their designs at the local IP office, have some additional protections on top of copyright law - if the latter applies."
"Which is why you can't design your phone to look exactly like the last IPhone.> How the hell do you patent a design?"
"You don't. It's called an industrial design right in Europe and is more akin to a trademark than a patent (but it's not a trademark). As far as I know, only USA calls them design patents which confuses a lot of people.In Germany, they are even called taste templates, or, to use a less direct translation, design trademarks.And the movie 'Predator' incidentally.Slide to detonate.[For those curious, here's the first clip that came up searching for it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRAKBBGbf4A)  Dude is totally right.even as the click sound lolYou did watch it didn't you? "
"You realise in the movie siri doesn't actually tell him how much wood a wood chuck would chuck if a wood chuck could chuck wood? "
"(the click was just another sound effect added to be like an iphone)i was not expecting this gold.When they make movies they always have interviews with actors, the director, maybe the writers, sometimes the special effects people. I want to know who came up with this. How did they decide each of those movements would be needed to start a timer for the bomb?God I forgot about that laughHe's not unlocking it he's just using Predator Tinder. You know, like Jared uses. So you're telling me my man, Steve Jobs, wasn't a genius? What's next? Global warming? Puh-leez...He was a genius in making people believe he was a genius."
"Geniusception!Marketing is a real skill. He was best at that. Love him or hate him (which Reddit does), you cannot deny that he did a HELL of a lot more than marketing. It was his vision that defined him, not his marketing team. He was best at being the leader of Apple.Not sure why you are getting downvotes. Marketing wasn't his biggest skill - TBWA\Chiat\Day came up with the greatest of the Apple commercials and marketing campaigns (1984, Think Different, Get a Mac) - Jobs was just the one who gave it the OK."
"Jobs was an incredible leader. His real skill was pushing skilled people in the right direction to create great products. He knew what he wanted, and he found people who could make it possible, then sweet talk or harass them into getting there."
"What has always made Apple stand out is the little bit extra that they put into their products to make it great, often taking risks and making compromises to meet the vision of the product. For example look at the MacBook Air - it was an amazing idea which fell short in performance, but was still a great product.> pushing skilled people in the right direction"
"As in away from him because he smelled?"
"Just a joke, I couldn't resist from making it. What you said is indeed right.Ok you can take his dick out of your ass now. He'd dead Jim.We'll never know, but how much of that was Jony Ive's insistence on product design and Steve Jobs basically trusted him?>- Jobs was just the one who gave it the OK."
">Jobs was an incredible leader. His real skill was pushing skilled people in the right direction to create great products. He knew what he wanted, and he found people who could make it possible, then sweet talk or harass them into getting there."
"THIS is exactly right. People keep saying he was a great marketer AND designer. He didn't design shit, he got people to design.Taking risks, until 2008. Then everything they released was the same shit, with minor tweaks, until the Apple Watch, which was just androids idea, tweaked a little, and released at a higher price. Really, the single biggest thing Apple really excels at is the drive for perfection - something that Jobs really brought to the corporate culture.  There are plenty of stories about Apple's push for perfection that comes to mind, but the one that stands out is the manufacturing process for one of their earlier MacBook Pro models.  Jobs was handed a CNC prototyped device and gave it a thumbs up, but after the first devices came off the manufacturing line, Jobs hated it.  The grain on the aluminum wasn't uniform, and it just didn't have the same *perfect finish* as the prototyped model he was given."
"The problem was that traditional manufacturing methods - die-casting and stamping - couldn't give you a 100% consistent look-and-feel.  Here is where most manufacturers will have a fuck it moment and just push ahead.  But not Apple, they went out and spent something like a quarter billion dollars on thousands of CNC prototyping machines, using them to custom-bore every single MacBook Pro body from a solid block of aluminum."
"Little aesthetic details like this is what really sets Apple apart from their competition.  When most companies will see something as a small-but-acceptable flaw or imperfection caused by the manufacturing process, Apple sees a road block.  Like the time when the designers at Apple wanted to incorporate a sleep light in the case without actually showing a hole through the aluminum to see it, so they went out and bought a company that could drill 20 um holes in the case - big enough to let light through unhindered, but small enough to not be visible by the naked eye.  Or the time when no manufacturer would create a thinner, oddly shaped battery cell that would fit their machine's design, so they started manufacturing them on their own."
"Many people who exclusively buy Apple devices do so because of that attention to detail.  While competitors are fine with just function and price - as are many customers, Apple focuses not only on the function, but also the look and feel.I'm getting downvotes because the Anti-Apple/Jobs cabal here can't see beyond their blind hatred for the man. It's like they literally can't give any credit to him, as if Apple could have been an iota of what it is today, and have a subsequent impact on today's world without him. Was he generally an unpleasant person? Sure. Misguided in some aspects? Who isn't? A tyrant? Yes. But to deny that he was a leader and visionary that had HUGE impact on his company and the world is completely ignorant.Read what the creative director of TBWA said about the campaigns jobs oversaw and you'll get some idea of what he did.Obligatory: [Has Apple Really Ever Invented Anything?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFeC25BM9E0)As an answer to the question without watching the video yet...

"No. And thats not a bad thing, but its still annoying. "
"Apple and Steve Jobs' strength wasnt necessarily inventing an idea. It was marketing it at the right time with the right 'sell'. Steve Jobs was one of the best marketers of all time. "
"Where it became annoying as shit was when that marketing turned into 'we invented this' just because they were the first ones to take already developed ideas and make them popular. best marketer of all time, kind of like being the prettiest piece of shit. If a product is good, it does a hundred times as much good in the hands of a hundred million people, than in the hands of only one million. The difference is marketing."
"I'm saying that as a person who's poor at it. I respect the contributions of those who do it well.> best marketer of all time, kind of like being the prettiest piece of shit. "
"Second best, greatest trick ever pulled was with diamonds by De BeersI remember when I was doing sales our team watched an apple presentation and our manager was solely harping on how they specifically try to make their customers *feel* special and better for buying their products. He kept telling us to emulate the genius of don't sell the product, sell the idea to people. Make them want to be a superior person for having bought it.  their last press conference was funny. "
"we have made the smaller logic board EVER! <pause> <applause> ^^^^ ^^^^In ^^^^a ^^^^macbook ^^^^Apple are good at marketing. But what they did better than anybody else (at least historically) was pay attention to the user experience."
"There were smart phones prior to the iPhone. There were mp3 players before the iPod. But Apple did them right."
"Because it's ultimately not about technical specifications. It's about how the user *feels* when using the device, and Apple were the first to really make the engineering department take the back seat and let the emotional state of the user be the driver.Exactly! There were touchscreen phones before the iPhone, but they were not nearly as nice to use. Apple went and did their darndest to make a good phone with a touchscreen, then Android phones responded, then Apple did some more stuff, Android did some other stuff and some years later here we are with a shitload of good (but also  expensive) smartphones. Apple didn't invent the smartphone or the touchscreen but they did have a huge input on the direction smartphones would take in the future.Steve Jobs in Civilization V is a Great Merchant. They did a lot of cool things with the Great People."
"My favorite: Rosalind Franklin is a Great Scientist."
"Watson and Crick aren't!I'm going to keep making this comment until people listen to me and either agree or dispute it: "
"What people attribute to Apple's marketing isn't just marketing. Marketing (in this context) isn't valuable to the consumer, it's a sort of trickery. But design is. Apple is primarily a design company, not a marketing company, not a company that invents things. The reason people buy Apple computers isn't just because they're marketed better, it's because they're designed better for those people."
"You don't look at a beautiful painting and say Oh, well, you know, that painter didn't invent paint or canvas. Therefore the reason anyone buys this painting over another painting is just because the painter employed more marketing rhetoric."
"You could design a webpage for your business or you could pay a talented professional to do it. They may have the same features. Buttons, information about your company, etc. But one will be shit, and the other people will like. This may be obvious with a webpage, but it's also true of objects, computers included. It's more enjoyable to use a well designed product. Aesthetically, tactically and functionally."
"Apple makes products that work fairly seamlessly together and independently. They're easy to use and they feel and look nice. That makes people like them. That's why people buy them. That's why people pay more for them. It's not just because their ads are that much better than every other company's. If you took an ad for a Macbook and swapped in the [Razer Blade 2015](http://koolwallpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Razer-blade.jpg), college girls everywhere wouldn't be using Razer Blade 2015s, they'd still want Macbooks. Macbooks are pretty, they don't look like a 14 year old boy made one, or like they were cobbled together by engineers who wanted to meet a spec sheet for the lowest price."
"Steve Jobs seems to have known something that people here talking shit about him (with regard to his value to the business. He still deserves lots of shit talked about him) still don't even understand in retrospect: The value of good design."
"I hate being in this position too, because I want to shit all over Apple for all the things they *do* deserve to be shit on for. Like making products that obfuscate their function such that people never learn how anything works when they use them, or for the walled garden ecosystem and attitude that degrades the experience when using non-Apple products with Apple products. But it's so annoying to keep hearing Oh, it's just all marketing.You make fair points. I would argue that you are confusing marketing with advertising, in which case you are perfectly correct. "
"One of the most important pillars of marketing is the product itself, and designing products that provide value is one of the core principles of marketing. "
"I completely agree with you in the sense that not all the ads in the world can sell a product that isnt properly designed, but I also definately think that having valuable products is firmly under the realm of marketing. I think you said something that encompasses the reason why Apple succeeded at selling to so many the people. Their greatest marketing achievement was convincing people that what they are selling is art when in reality it's simply esthetically appealing design and user functionality. This mirrors the competitors rather nicely by giving the user a wider cushion from the technical underpinnings of their pc and an understanding of what makes their device tick, all while giving them something pretty to look at."
"All I'm saying here is that Apple used what I consider brilliant design to target (through clever marketing) a group of people who aren't drawn to a more technical device; i.e. the artists and college girls of the world. "
"Well saidGood point. Agree with what you said. But here's the thing... They keep saying they invented' all that shit and that the technology is  revolutionary  or the cringeworthy insanely great if you will...Well, you got me. I agree with you.You are correct, but what you describe is, for good reason, not supposed to be patentable. It's not invention.I would say that a lot of famous artists are famous because they did something new.  They didn't invent paint or canvas,  but they created new styles, breaking from previous conventions. This is especially true in the late 1800s to present day in the US and Europe. In their time,  the artists might not have even been famous.  If comparing Apple products to art, you'd have to go with a modern,  currently producing artist because Apple is currently producing their products.  Comparing people purchasing Apple to buying  Van Gough doesn't work.  (sorry for any misspellings, im on my phone) people underestimate design."
"and often confuse it with marketing too.That's because design and marketing overlap a lot. "
"Great post, unfortunately, the position is your alone and not the one that Apple shares or has been promoting."
"Apple has good aesthetics (design is too technical in this case) and great marketing. That is about it.And honestly, only 13% of Americans own a mac computer.   They are not that popular in the US.The Macbook was cobbled together by designers to look pretty, not by engineers who understand cooling.Most early marketing classes talk about the [4 Ps:](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_mix)"
"* Product: what is it and does it fit the target market"
"* Promotion: where do people in your market hear about it and what do you say"
"* Placement: where do people in your market buy it"
"* Price: is it the right cost for the market"
"You're picking one part of marketing from the whole. "
"Apple is a great marketing company because they so consistently nail all 4 Ps. "
"Deter Rams comes to mind when you consider design. I remember in my college art class having that discussion. The side by side comparison pictures were better, but I couldn't figure out where my teacher got them. Maybe she made them."
"http://www.cultofmac.com/188753/the-braun-products-that-inspired-apples-iconic-designs-gallery/Andy Warhol absolutely sold his paintings and got famous because of his weird persona and marketing rhetoric.  It certainly wasn't because of the quality of his paintings."
"But your point stands.  I agree.> I hate being in this position too, because I want to shit all over Apple for all the things they do deserve to be shit on for. Like making products that obfuscate their function such that people never learn how anything works when they use them, or for the walled garden ecosystem and attitude that degrades the experience when using non-Apple products with Apple products. But it's so annoying to keep hearing Oh, it's just all marketing."
"Aye! Exactly! Very well said."
"I dislike Apple for the same reasons. But it is not trivial how they brought technology to people when no one else did.Not exactly true. Back in the beginning the *only* thing Apple did that no other computer did was line up a nationwide school distribution contract. In the 80's it was Commodore and Tandy that brought the computer to the home, not Apple. For Apples part, they create the Mac in the late 80's, a move that jump starts the use of graphical interfaces on computers. Absolutely, 100% correct and I agree with every word. Jobs annoyed the fucking shit out of me but he was good at what he did."
"Hope you don't get downvoted to shit by people who don't understand.I still hate the sterile, identity-lacking look of everything they produce.TL:DR: Jobs had a natural understanding of what the average consumer wants and the proper personality to go against the current standards > I hate being in this position too, because I want to shit all over Apple for all the things they do deserve to be shit on for. Like making products that obfuscate their function such that people never learn how anything works when they use them, or for the walled garden ecosystem and attitude that degrades the experience when using non-Apple products with Apple products. But it's so annoying to keep hearing Oh, it's just all marketing."
"While I 100% agree with the rest of your comment, this part in particular struck me as odd."
"Something I've always felt, and still defend to this day, is that Apple makes OSX in a way that you can go as deep as you want but you're never forced to."
"My example is myself. I tend to almost never use the mouse and I spend over half of my time in the terminal. "
"Every time I've needed to learn something new it hasn't been far away or harder than in, say, Linux or BSD (the other ones I use). If anything, Windows has constantly seemed to me like a black box of weakly-held bits of string and sticks where the best solution tends to be just reinstall (and it's the official solution in the F500 company I work for if any issue takes longer than 30 minutes to fix)."
"Even when Apple drops advanced support of some way (for example, dropping Samba in Lion for their own SMB2 solution) it's not complex to add it yourself, if you know you need it (in this case, I made a tool for it, but someone else would've if not)."
"If you're referring to iOS then I wouldn't be so adamant but at least regarding OSX I wholly disagree.I consider OSX and the mac in a completely different light from the phones. The machines themselves are excellent, and the os is precisely as you described. But iOS (and the devices) are the opposite. They're downright user hostile if you try to do anything outside prescribed, simplest use.I think a lot of what you say is true. But I also think there is definitely a strong marketing value to Apple too. Part of the value is better (or at least better for that user) design. But part is definitely that it was the must have device, it was cooler, part of it was brand loyalty, partially inspired by design but also partially inspired by the coolness cult that Apple inspired. I think a lot of that has died down in the last couple of years. But the other marketing driver, market saturation still exists building on it. Try finding a decent stereo dock for a samsung off the shelf.  And a lot of that is a mix of that design you mention but also the marketing that used its market position to build it up even further."
"Tl;dr I agree they did some good design stuff, but then they also took that and marketed the shit out of it to the extent that the brand became a significant part of the product. They are not alone in doing this but they did it to an extent not often seen.When the average person refers to any tablet as an iPad, they're doing something right. I would say that that is not only marketing strength but also a mastery of analyzing what the current market wants and pouncing on products at the right time. As the other reply to your comment said, many people consider iPad and tablet to be synonymous. But I would attribute this more to Apple introducing the first well-made consumer tablet to the world. At the time it seemed like a strange move (why do I need a big iPhone? I already have one.) but in retrospect they not only struck at the exact time that the world was moving towards a mobile life, but also kickstarted an entire market for tablets that didn't exist before (remember Android Honeycomb?). When you can single-handedly generate a new market like that, you've struck at the right time. I like this argument. "
"Although, I still feel like a lot of their products have a bad case of function following form: itunes, OSX dock and window management, and pretty much every mouse Apple has ever made. I think form over function applies to all their products. I still can't work out how to turn my thunderbolt display off without unplugging it. The funny thing with Apple is that their hardware development teams are the gold-standard of the industry, but once it's passed to their software teams, there's problems.   "
"iTunes has taken a lot of warranted criticism for making it just too cumbersome to manage what should be a simple library of music files, to give an example.   iPods are great but I hate iTunes with a passion.You're just going the other extreme."
"Yes, Apple isn't just a marketing company, but they also aren't just a design company."
"If you put a macbook under the name Acer and gave it the same marketing Acer gives its products, it would not sell anywhere close to the number of the exact same product Apple sells."
"The other factor that also comes in to play is brand value.  "
"It has become cool to own an Apple, cooler than owning the exact same thing under a different name.that brand value is the dividend of consistent good design starting with the iMac in the late 90's, then the iBook, iPod, etc."
"People who use Apple products will have good experiences with their products, and keep buying more Apple products, even if there other companies out there that might have better products, but also a lot of inferior ones.> The reason people buy Apple computers isn't just because they're marketed better, it's because they're designed better for those people."
"This right here is something that a lot of people seem to miss when figuring out why some companies enjoy moderate success, while others become ingrained into our culture and way of life. I don't know if you came to this conclusion on your own, /u/OneBigBug or if you saw the same TED talk I did, but if you haven't I can't recommend [The Golden Circle] (http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en) by Simon Sinek enough! Some pretty interesting stuff that he talks about.Good point. Agree with what you said. But here's the thing... They keep saying they invented' all that shit and that the technology is  revolutionary  or the cringeworthy insanely great if you will..."
"Edit: Also, Jobs put multiple patents on the way the iPod Nano is placed in its box. That's just petty coming from a company that prides itself on innovation"
"He put a patent on the way you place something in a box? That is possible? Holy shit.What made me cringe was the Retina label, for simply a high-DPI screen.   Yeah, it's like taking an 8-cylinder engine and market it as a Super Engine then sue if anyone else calls their engine that, even if it's also an 8-cylinder engine.   "
"I talked to an Apple fanatic once about Retina back when the Nexus 10 came out.   Higher DPI display than the iPad had at the time but he couldn't believe it was any good since it wasn't a Retina display.Good thing slide to unlock has been replaced with thumbprintYe but now that Apple has all your thumbprints in their DB... But to be fair Apple seem o be doing their part speaking up for encryption against the NSA"
"EDIT: Good morning reddit! I seem to have missed the point that your thumbprint doesn't leave you Apple device. Sorry I don't tend to use Apple so don't keep up too much on their news."
"EDIT2: You guys are angry in the morning -13 (and sliding) in about 10 mins."
"EDIT3: This is turning into a joke now... Your downvotes cant hurt me!The thumbprint is stored locally on a secure chip inside the device. Your print is nowhere except physically inside the device in your hand.That's not how it works. If I recall, the fingerprint is stored in the secure element of the SoC. It is not stored in the OS files or backed up to Apple servers. Reddit is shit hot this morning. 5 replies in 2-3 minutes. Ye I don't read much of apple news. Just thought the idea of having your fingerprint on a device is a bad idea. ANy idea if this has been independently verified though? Would be interested to see if the guys at Defcon can get this info.Nope. Apple has no fingerprint database. All fingerprint storage and checking happens on the physical device, with no communication of it elsewhere.How would you know this? Its proprietary software, you must assume they keep all your shit with proprietary software."
"Edit: Praise be FOSSThe fact that it's been around for nearly 2 years and the jailbreaking community has yet to touch the Secure Enclave should be a pretty good indication."
"You can only get a yes/no response from the enclave. What DB?  All fingerprints are stored mathematically on chip and on device.  There is no way for Apple to decrypt your data if the phone is locked.Fair enough have edited my post...I mean I don't have even the faintest glimmer of being able to validate this with my own work, but apparently the prints stay on your device in an encrypted chip. It's not even the print, either. It's essentially a hash of the data about the print, something that can be verified when the finger is scanned agin in the future, but not enough data to reconstruct the actual print on its own. Bruh you really don't think they could get your fingerprint from your phone if they wanted to?I get what you're saying but without any evidence I have to disregard this type of thinking.I guess I'm just cynical. I assume that if they wanted to the government could access anything made by an American company, and probably a lot of international ones too.One-way algorithms are not a thing of policies and politics though.  They simply exist.Perhaps on a long enough timeline but if something is made to not store data in a harmful way, it won't magically start because big brother wills it.How do you know how the data is stored though? It's proprietary.All available sources claim that the data is just hash data of parts of a print, not the entire thing. I have no solid proof of that I suppose but there's nothing but conjecture and conspiracy saying otherwise. Neither stance is provable by you or I. To quote someone awesome I get what you're saying but without any evidence I have to disregard this type of thinking.Noobie here, are all finger print hashes made using the same formula? Because if they are can't you just reverse the formula to turn a hash back into the raw thumbprint data? Unless of course the data is even more vague than that.The point of hashes is the data can't be mutated back. The way you check passwords/thumbprints is you hash it again and check if it matches the existing hash. You would need to run every possible fingerprint through the hashing process and check it against the hash to know the original hash.The algorithms for hashes are one-way, meaning you can easily go from source to hash, but going from hash to source is very hard (due to loss of information, mainly)."
"For example, let's say you have the string:"
"I am a walrus"
"And our hash algorithm is The number of letters in each word."
"The hash for our string would be: 1 2 1 6. From a hash of 1216 you cannot easily go back to I am a walrus."
"Now, this is a very crude example - our hash algorithm is extremely insecure, because if we have the hash of 1216 we can arbitrarily generate strings that are different than the source string, but would still yield the same hash.  This is known as 'collision'. Actual hashing algorithms such as [SHA-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) are more resilient to collisions."
"Apple is hashing your fingerprint, so they have a hashing algorithm and they store the hash of your fingerprint. When you scan it, they just take the scan, hash it, and verify it against their stored hash."
"Their operation is probably more complex than that - because their algorithm should be flexible enough to detect the same fingerprint in various differing positions.Thanks for that amazing explanation. I was also wondering how they can scan every finger perfectly as to create the same hash. Maybe they can detect the orientation of the finger or they can find the center of your print. Maybe it looks at distance between finger print rings?I really like your explanation. But couldn't as with your hash several different fingerprints result in the same hash and therefore reduce security (ie in your example different sentences could lead to the same hash value) ? I don't know anything about such stuff so my question may be dumb. That's a very good question. Yes, the simple hash function I've described is very insecure, because it's vulnerable to hash collision: Two different sentences could lead to the same hash. Real-life hash functions are much more complex, and are designed to avoid these collisions, partly by having longer hashes."
"Furthermore, real-life hash functions are designed in a way that two slightly differing inputs generate wildly different hashes."
"Let's show this using the SHA1 algorithm. For the input Hello world we get this hash:   "
"33ab5639bfd8e7b95eb1d8d0b87781d4ffea4d5d"
"If we modify our sentence very very slightly, by changing the initial H to I (a change of just one letter, changing it to the very next letter), we get Iello world which has this hash:"
"c846d1588da92463ef51af57d40f64df20a31531"
"As you can see, the two hashes are very different although the source input is very similar. Hmm that statement is a little misleading, it's not really possible to use a cryptographic hash on biometrics because biometric scanners don't produce the same exact result every time. For example for a finger print orientation of finger, pressure applied, sweat level etc all change every time a user scans their finger."
"For a standard cryptographic hash, any tiny change should have a  a dramatic change on the has function. This is obviously makes it unusable for biometrics, and it's something that is actually being actively researched at my university."
"There are a few alternatives, but as far as I'm away (it's not my area of expertise, but I have discussed this not that long ago with researchers in this area) they aren't perfect yet, still kind of in their early stages for being reliable enough to deploy."
"I've had a quick look and apart from source less news articles I can't actually find any evidence of apple actually applying a proper one way hash on their biometric data. If you have some info about this I'd love to have a read to figure out what approach they took, and how much they had to compromise."
"That all said, regardless of what they're doing to store your biometrics it really doesn't matter, I could strip your finger print off a phone in a few minutes if I really wanted too, and if they were sharing governments only needs the hash, not the original data to match. Fingerprints really shouldn't be considered private considering you leave them everywhere.Unchangeable passwords are as useful as zombie kittens.Welcome to the TINY world of apple incorporating Jailbroken creations!"
"Once you jailbreak, you always jailbreak.Not always true. As much as I love jailbreak, and have always jailbroken every iPhone I've ever had, I decided not to crack my iPhone 6. Purely because there isn't too much that Apple hasn't introduced in their new iOS that I feel I really need from jailbreaking. The only exception being flux. And also, because for me, I always found it got to the point where I had too many useless tweaks installed and forgot to update or modify everything to keep it running smoothly. It was always crashing and respringing so yeah, not necessarily the fault of jailbreak, but just my reasoning for not jailbreaking this time. It was just too much hassle. I just want a simple, slick, phone that does everything I need. Jailbreaking can get out of hand, but once you're out of the honeymoon phase (it took me like a year to realize I don't need 150+ tweaks with most of them being fun/aesthetics), it's the best thing that's happened to an iPhone.  Some really simple overlooked crap can be improved.  "
"Play YouTube in the background while using other apps, VideoPane to have a draggable video while using other apps, cutting off animations completely (this freaked out my friends and family when they used my iPhone.  They were surprised at how snappy it was.  You don't really realize how sluggish stock iPhones can be just because of a simple thing like open/close animations), timed texts, recording your screen without the use of a computer, recording with the toggle flashlight, god damn widgets (I mean come on, how has Apple not implemented these?), **Nightmode**, and a few other tweaks I have installed.  I went from 150+ to just over 15.  I'm glad Apple finally took custom keyboards into the app store, though.  Been using swype since it was released.Only thing I really want to be able to have is unlocked bluetooth. But I turned to Android instead, because I got fed up by Apple's bullshit. Also being able to use my phone as a USB memory without having to install third-party programs on every single god damn computer."
"I do prefer iOS over Android though.Honestly when I jailbreak I find I spend more time tweaking my phone than actually using it. But oh my god f.lux is amazing. Worth jailbreaking just for that.  Hang on, how did Apple take thumbprint recognition from the jailbreak community? The hardware wasn't there. Oh! I thought you meant the text was replaced by the thumbprint glyph! Sorry, my bad. You misinterpreted. The thumbprint isn't the recognition, it's the little Apple pay symbol over where the slide to unlock sign would be if you install the tweak LockGlyphYou mean this [thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMWrtpZlDew)? Frankly, it looks useless to me. It seems to be slower than the standard Touch ID log in. At best it adds a nice visual cue when your thumbprint is recognized, at worst, it misleads me into thinking that my thumbprint is being read when in fact it doesn't recognize my finger at all.  I prefer the standard shake when it doesn't recognize my thumbprint, the feedback is more immediate.The Bundesgerichtshof is not our surpreme court, that would be the Bundesverfassungsgericht. It is however the highest court for all matters that aren't related to the constitution (Grundgesetz).the BGH is the highest national civil court.Now you summoned r/hearthstoneI've got the beast in my sights!> Bundesverfassungsgericht"
"How do you people get anything done with a language like that? I'd be up til 2am typing my morning hellos to everyone.Eh, it's really not that different from the way it's named in the US."
"You have the United States (i.e. federal) Supreme Court, they have the Bundes (=federal) verfassungs (=constitutional) gericht (=court). Both consist of three words."
"We German speakers simply leave out the superfluous spaces between those words, so instead of federal constitutional court, it's rendered as federalconstitutionalcourt.Learn Icelandic."
"glofagjordarmadur is glove maker.It's not like every word of everyday language is ages long."
"Aside from that, the word exactly discribes what the court is about. It really is just 3 words tucked together.My understanding of the German language is that nouns can be combined into a single word. For example, the equivalent court in the US would be called the Unitedstatessupremecourt. "
"Doesn't look so bad when you can break down that uber long word into its constituents. This dude got it."
"If you would translate it literally and stick it together it would be Federalconstitutionalcourt."
"Bundes|Verfassung|Gericht"
"Federal|Constitution|CourtYeah, some people are always commenting about how long German words can be, but usually they're shorter than their (complete) translation because there's no spaces. "
"Bundesverfassungsgericht (24 characters) compared to Federal Constitutional Court (28 characters)Exactly that. And I don't get how its only German that is made fun of for this, many germanic languages do it, I mean look at Finnish and all its endless words full of aaaaaaa... *epajarjestelmallistyttamattomyydellansakaankohan*Except that word doesn't really mean anything and can't be used in any context except in a one that highlights the absurdities of the Finnish language. The syntax is correct but semantics not so much. But it's a fucked up language for sure."

"The BHG is the supreme court of civil and criminal law (ordinary jurisdiction)."
"The BVerfG is the supreme constitutional court (public law)."
"And there are four supreme courts for special jurisdiction: federal supreme court of: finance, labour, social and administration."
"Relative to each other the BVerfG can overrule any of the other five if the matter touches constitutional rights. Each of the other five only judge cases within their area of the law."
"Still horrendous. The money spent on these arguments could be spent elsewhere. Everyone's being polite but there are some people supporting such petty patent crap who could use a real beating for their self-interested lobbying. But they're not just 'arguments', and while, yes, slide-to-unlock seems petty and small, it extends to a whole plethora of technologies that allow it to function the way it does. Apple is the value of an oil giant after only 8 years of the iPhone existing, and Samsung is basically the back-bone to South Korea's economy. Also the entire population of this planet wants a new smartphone. The question of who can patent what, and how long these patents can be upheld, influences how billions if not trillions of dollars will flow decades into the future.The whole world wants water to drink. A very big chunk of the world population still thinks that apple is only a fruit."

"Any first world argument about anything there's always someone talking about less fortunate countries. I don't think those countries are even thinking about patents so it doesn't relate to this. "

You underestimate how prevalent this technology has gotten,  *everywhere*.Sounds like it would be pretty helpful to be able to google the locations of clean water and food. > Sounds like it would be pretty helpful to be able to google the locations of clean water and food."
"Yes...because poverty has nothing to do with their problem. They have plenty of resources to trade for clean water and food, if only they knew where their local Walmart was /s.Not really. Smartphones are becoming a thing for even impoverished nations. Why put up tons of telephone poles and run cables everywhere when one tower can service 100sq miles? Smartphone popularity is exploding in places like China, India, and many African countries because a basic smartphone can do tons of things while still being pretty damn cheap.There's an article on the NY Times right now, how food, shelter and a smartphone are the new basic necessities for migrant refugees.

"The Second World refers to the former socialist industrial states (formally the Eastern Bloc), mostly the territory and area under the influence of the Soviet Union."
"I don't think that means what you think it means. Additionally, you're using the fallacy of relative privation which doesn't solve anything. what's it called when you learn something new, and see it everywhere now. Because that fallacy thing that was on the front page the other day. EVERYWHERE!!!!https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baader-Meinhof_phenomenonSome of those patents are like patent for having windows in home.Also, even to the pettiest things, Apple need to be seen as prepared to fight for what they think is theirs. Else other companies will stop taking an inch and start taking a mile. Not saying it's right, it's simply the symptom of a broken patent system in dire need of reform.But what I'm trying to say, is that they're not petty at all. To, you maybe some tiny part in your phone is petty, but it's existence in there alone is evidence of an infintely complicated system of factories out there making these 'petty' part. And since you and *billions* of others are willing to pay top-dollar for the newest phone, there is a lot of mouths fed out there by that system. The question of who gets how big pieces of the pie within that system is an infinitely complex one. And that's what the legal system is there for. And it's not broken, it is what it is. The law is like a programming language, so sometimes when these cases pop up it's easy to for non lawyers such as ourselves to misinterpret or deny credibility to the system, but the lawyers know what they're doing, and they are under close observation of other lawyers and law-makers so it's not like there are any shenanigans really going on.  1000 times this. The decisions made in Intellectual Property cases around the world aren't just about the seemingly silly arguments being settled at the time. It's the precedents being set that make huuuge waves in the entire industry. This particular case is idiotic and highlights much that is wrong with the patent system though.  All they did was digitize a locking system that's been around for a really long damn time.  It's like someone trying to patent shirts or orgasms.>patent orgasms"
"There's money to be made there, I'm just not quite sure how.The female orgasm can be tricky...Do Apple and Samsung really owe their success to these silly patents?"
"Amazon famously and ludicrously owned the patent to one-click purchasing - finding an explanation for how this is non-obvious stymies the most imaginative of minds. After all, before the Internet, purchasing took *no clicks*; one click does seem like the obvious goal, should purchasing require a non-zero amount of clicks."
"But I don't buy from Amazon because it takes me a few milliseconds less effort. I buy from them because of their selection, prices, delivery speed, etc. A few extra clicks never changed my decision about anything."
"The same is true of slide-to-unlock. It's incredibly obvious. Mechanical sliding locks existed literally hundreds of years ago. Animating it on a screen is not non-obvious. Apple and Samsung make great products and employ legions of brilliant people; their success is not predicated on ridiculous patents."
"I don't blame them for taking full advantage of the system as it exists; if they hadn't their competitors would have and no one would remember Apple or Samsung or Amazon. "
"But that doesn't mean the system is good.Question for you that I don't think either of us can answer fully:"
"How many competitors** did Amazon hinder by slapping them with a cease and desist letter due to their shit-patent(s)?"
"**competitors in this case does not mean direct competitor as in Walmart or Chapters but instead means anyone with an online shop that might have taken a handful of sales away from Amazon."
"Even if the answer is zero, an argument could still be made that these shit-patents discourage competition.  This is not a measurable ROI but can influence decisions up the management hierarchy."
"Thus the shit-patents need to die a horrible death so that people make better decisions based on real evidence rather than pursuing competition deterrents via legal channels.>lawcase"
"Found the GermanDoes this mean that now the European Patent Office automatically revokes it in all 38 member states?No, patents are unique to jurisdictions.I don't think so. But it should be easy for Samsung (or anyone) to introduce this ruling in any applicable patent case in the EU.No, I think it only applies for German law. This wasn't an European court.Holy shit this is turning into a comment graveyard. And here I came in expecting a reasonable discussion. "
"DAE hate Apple rounded corners lolWhat a silly world we live in where this even happens.  It gets sillier when you realise Apple tried to even own the tap to open because that should be considered  a zero length swipewtf, really?That's how my phone operates now, everytime I tap to open something it flicks to another desktop page.Apple's lawyers argued that in court, they wanted the judge to rule on that as the correct interpretation of the patent.The patent already served its purpose for Apple. Samsung never used it (as far as I know) and now it's hardly used. Today, people use their fingerprint to unlock. The fingerprint thing doesn't work well enough to use it all the time. I wish it did, but I've resorted to sliding and entering my code and so have most people I know. The smallest amount of moisture on either your finger or the scanner itself will prevent it from working.Works 99% of the time for me -\_(tsu)_/-"
"My job requires a long, complex password (no PIN) on our device so Touch ID has been a godsend. I think the slide to unlock was relevant back with the Galaxy S2. Could be wrong tho... But I remember Sony Ericsson Arc and other models had slide to unlock but as far as I know Apple never went after them. WierdI use NFC ring to unlockNFC ring?Http://nfcring.comAm I missing something? This is one of the weakest forms of security. If you lose your phone and ring, you're pretty much fucked if someone picks them up. You can set a secondary unlock mechanism too...  So yeah that plays a big part I guess!But then what's the point? Now that just makes it inconvenient."
"NFC has a lot of great uses. This is not one of them. You obviously have no idea.Finger print unlock was something utilized in Lenovo ThinkPad before being put on a phone.But it was super inaccurate and required you rolling your finger over the scanner sometimes multiple times before it registered. In the amount of time you could do that, you might as well have just typed in your password."
"Say what you want about Apple, but they actually did it right. The fingerprint scanner on the iPhone is super fast.Yeah I remember those. The implementation sucked on the ThinkPad. Apple and Samsung's tech is much faster, more secure and reliable. There's no comparison. and there was a phone before iphone that had a fingerprint scanner.Motorola was headed in the right direction with the Atrix, but the hardware was just not there yet. Also that webtop was a brilliant idea I really thought that was gonna take off and everyone would use similar products by now. I was wrong. And you could convert the laptop dock into a portable monitor and keyboard + trackpad for a PC, games console and even Raspberry Pi.I only ever slide anymore when my fingers are dirty or the TouchID sensor is smudged. Why does everybody keep mentioning fingerprints?"
"I've never used my fingerprint to unlock a phone and never saw anybody else do it either."
"It was always a slide to unlock.I use a PIN."
"Am I so out of touch? No. It's the children who are wrong.For what it's worth, I use a PIN too. The 5th ammendment protects us from turning over knowledge that may be self-incriminating, but doesn't protect biometric data. Basically, during a traffic stop a cop can legally ask you to finger print unlock you phone so they can look in itI slide to unlock to my pin. That is literally how I unlock my 6 99% of the time. the 1% is after a reboot where you have to put your passcode in. You're in the vast minority. wat[deleted]That doesn't mean they are in the majority. Galaxy S6 user here. I don't see others using the fingerprint option nearly as often :("

"Maybe I misread your comment. While I think my strikethroughed  sentence is correct, it's irrelevant to what you were talking about. "
"There truly a lot of people who don't use the fingerprint scanner on either side of the OS fence just based on ignorance. Fuck, a friend of mine said that they wouldn't ever use a fingerprint scanner because of it being less secure than a regular passcode, which is a load of shit. But all I have are guesses. S/he's in the overwhelming majority. Here in London I have never seen anyone use their thumb print to unlock an iPhone once. And yet I see several hundreds of people unlock their iPhone every day. As I've said to all the others, that doesn't make them the majority. A majority of those you see maybe, but not an overall majority. I think the totality of the population that I've encountered on public transport during my daily commute over an arc of 3 years (?) since fingerprint locking was a thing, plus any number of people I see or meet in public places, in one of the largest cities in the world *and* one of the top cities for iPhone owners, both as raw number and percentage of population, is a statistically significant sample."
"There is potential for it to be confirmation bias, but at this point it would be pretty damned coincidental.How would you see them? They press the button, as they press it the phone unlocks. Any phone that didn't have a passcode would look the same while in use.You can distinctly see people in that moment where they take their phone out of their pocket/bag, whether they hover their finger on the base of the phone or swipe it across the screen. If they do neither, it's because they were using the fingerprint while taking it out.On my 5S the phone is unlocked as I take my finger off the button. There is no delay. I'm not sure how you can be so confident.  Because a screen-wide swiping motion stands out. Both when performed with the hand holding the phone and with the other.The question is why wouldn't you? Instead of entering a PIN I just use my fingerprint...so much easier. New England, only ever see slide and pins here.Not exactly, allot of people I know own iPhones and also use thumbprint. It's pretty cool honestly.Be that as it may, it doesn't mean those that do are in the majority. For some reason it doesn't work well enough for me and many of my coworkers, and my fiance. I'd love to use it 99% of the time, but it's more like half because it generally always fails. Even the slightest bit of moisture will prevent it from working.Or when your finger is even the slightest bit damp, or if the phone has condensation on it..For me it's 80/20, because I'm sweaty. Same here. It really is something that I wouldn't imagine myself using so much before actually using it. The 5s and up have people use it constantly. Fingerprint unlocking is pretty fast with an iPhone.What's also great is that this taught people to lock their phones. I had my previous phones without any password until I got the 5S with the fingerprint sensor.I slide to unlock my AndroidSame. Anyone who uses fingerprint is a fucking moron.I understand the potential security/privacy concerns but honestly life's just too short to sweat the small stuff. Maybe if I was a public figure I'd reevaluate my stance. Just because he thinks that people do x are fucking morons doesn't mean he 'sweats it'."
"For example, right now I'm going to think of an activity to which I would attribute fucking morons to, the catch being that I've never once in my life thought of the activity before or ever 'sweat it' nor do I ever plan to 'sweat it'. "
"OK the activity is: Hammering chunks of drywall into your mouth until you die. "
"Anyone who hammers chunks of drywall into their mouths until they die is a fucking moron. This isn't a longstanding opinion of mine, but I was able to, on the fly, evaluate the activity and deem it for fucking morons. "
"Maybe that's what that guy did.Can you explain why you think that please?he's being a cock but he is right. A finger print is very easily spoofed and offers very poor security. Finger print scanners are just not that good and despite what you see in movies are very rarely the only thing securing an area or device."
"Typically a finger print makes a good username, but a bad password.Spoofing a fingerprint still requires special equipment, sneaking around, and hours of work. Looking over someone's shoulder takes five seconds of pointing your eyes.It really isn't that hard. It'll deter friends and familly from snooping, but if someone wants to get into your phone (say to get at your personal information) a fingerprint is less of an obstacle than a decent PIN.Since when are laser printers special? 1h is more than you need "
"http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/12/politicians-fingerprint-reproduced-using-photos-of-her-hands/So you're saying that if my iPhone was stolen someone with the right knowledge could unlock it somehow?All security is a deterrent. If someone wants into your phone, they will find a way. Same with your house and everything you own. the trick is a level of security that is high enough to deter anyone who is interested in having a crack at whatever you want to protect, while not being so high as to cause unneeded fuss. A fingerprint is fine for keeping out a casual snooper, but if you've got anything that's actually sensitive, I'd be opting for a PIN or password."
"Trivially. "
"http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/12/politicians-fingerprint-reproduced-using-photos-of-her-hands/ "
"Yeah but we *are* talking about phones here, so either way, it's a finger print or a 4 digit passcode. Yeah sure you could use something longer, but no one really wants to pull up a full keyboard and put in a full password every time they unlock their phone. Locking your phone at this point isn't really to secure it against anyone who really wants to get in, it's just to stop your friend from texting your mom or something.Absolutely, it's all relative. I have complex password on my work phone because well... work phone. That said on my personal phone I also have mobile banking apps, and logins to my various accounts. If that got stolen or lost, at the very least I'd be worried about identity theft."
"At the end of the day I can't blame people who want to use a fingerprint, and it's absolutely better than nothing. Just so long as people are aware that it's far less secure than a password, or even a decent pattern lock.Yep. Because what's on my phone is important enough that someone is gonna lift my fingerprints to get into it. "
"Oh wait. That's not the case. And using a fingerprint is super convenient compared to a passcode or password. http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/12/politicians-fingerprint-reproduced-using-photos-of-her-hands/ "
"It is pretty easy to do. "
"Also; http://gizmodo.com/cops-can-make-you-fingerprint-unlock-your-phone-and-th-1653984192Actually its awesome.Yes, because slide to unlock is way more secure."
"Anyone who uses a fingerprint in preference to slide to unlock has a clue.Can't speak towards other devices, but it's handled well on iPhone."
"Your print itself is never stored, only a hash of the print is, and that data never leaves the device."
"It's stored in a separate secure hardware enclave on the device, and to date, no one has been able to hack and retrieve data from that enclave."
"Interesting white paper on iOS security that covers Touch ID, and the 256bit hardware crypto engine iOS devices use if you're actually interested in what's happening when TouchID is used:"
"https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf"
"In any case, it's leagues safer and easier to use than say, a 4 digit pin which most people use if they bother at all."
"Meh, fuck it, long paste incoming:"
"**Secure Enclave**"
"The Secure Enclave is a coprocessor fabricated in the Apple A7 or later A-series processor. It utilizes its own secure boot and personalized software update separate from the application processor. It provides all cryptographic operations for Data Protection key management and maintains the integrity of Data Protection even if the kernel has   been compromised."
"The Secure Enclave uses encrypted memory and includes a hardware random number generator. Its microkernel is based on the L4 family, with modifications by Apple. Communication between the Secure Enclave and the application processor is isolated   to an interrupt-driven mailbox and shared memory data buffers."
"Each Secure Enclave is provisioned during fabrication with its own UID (Unique ID)   that is not accessible to other parts of the system and is not known to Apple. When   the device starts up, an ephemeral key is created, entangled with its UID, and used to encrypt the Secure Enclave's portion of the device's memory space."
"Additionally, data that is saved to the file system by the Secure Enclave is encrypted   with a key entangled with the UID and an anti-replay counter."
"The Secure Enclave is responsible for processing fingerprint data from the Touch ID sensor, determining if there is a match against registered fingerprints, and then enabling access or purchases on behalf of the user. Communication between the processor and the Touch ID sensor takes place over a serial peripheral interface  bus. The processor forwards the data to the Secure Enclave but cannot read it. It's encrypted and authenticated with a session key that is negotiated using the device's shared key that is provisioned for the Touch ID sensor and the Secure Enclave. The session key exchange uses AES key wrapping with both sides providing a random   key that establishes the session key and uses AES-CCM transport encryption."
"**Touch ID**"
"Touch ID is the fingerprint sensing system that makes secure access to the device faster and easier. This technology reads fingerprint data from any angle and learns more about a user's fingerprint over time, with the sensor continuing to expand the fingerprint map as additional overlapping nodes are identified with each use."
"Touch ID makes using a longer, more complex passcode far more practical because users won't have to enter it as frequently. Touch ID also overcomes the inconvenience of a passcode-based lock, not by replacing it but by securely providing access to the device within thoughtful boundaries and time constraints."
"**Touch ID and passcodes**"
"To use Touch ID, users must set up their device so that a passcode is required to unlock it. When Touch ID scans and recognizes an enrolled fingerprint, the device unlocks without asking for the device passcode. The passcode can always be used instead of Touch ID, and it's still required under the following circumstances:"
"* The device has just been turned on or restarted"
"* The device has not been unlocked for more than 48 hours"
"* The device has received a remote lock command"
"* After five unsuccessful attempts to match a fingerprint"
"* When setting up or enrolling new fingers with Touch ID"
"When Touch ID is enabled, the device immediately locks when the Sleep/Wake button is pressed. With passcode-only security, many users set an unlocking grace period to avoid having to enter a passcode each time the device is used. With Touch ID, the device locks every time it goes to sleep, and requires a fingerprint--or optionally the passcode--at every wake."
"Touch ID can be trained to recognize up to five different fingers. With one finger enrolled, the chance of a random match with someone else is 1 in 50,000. However, Touch ID allows only five unsuccessful fingerprint match attempts before the user is required to enter a passcode to obtain access."
"**Touch ID security**"
"The fingerprint sensor is active only when the capacitive steel ring that surrounds the Home button detects the touch of a finger, which triggers the advanced imaging array to scan the finger and send the scan to the Secure Enclave."
"The 88-by-88-pixel, 500-ppi raster scan is temporarily stored in encrypted memory within the Secure Enclave while being vectorized for analysis, and then it's discarded. The analysis utilizes subdermal ridge flow angle mapping, which is a lossy process  that discards minutia data that would be required to reconstruct the user's actual fingerprint. **The resulting map of nodes is stored without any identity information in   an encrypted format that can only be read by the Secure Enclave, and is never sent   to Apple or backed up to iCloud or iTunes.**"
"**How Touch ID unlocks an iOS device**"
"If Touch ID is turned off, when a device locks, the keys for Data Protection class Complete, which are held in the Secure Enclave, are discarded. The files and keychain items in that class are inaccessible until the user unlocks the device by entering his or her passcode."
"With Touch ID turned on, the keys are not discarded when the device locks; instead, they're wrapped with a key that is given to the Touch ID subsystem inside the Secure Enclave. When a user attempts to unlock the device, if Touch ID recognizes the user's fingerprint, it provides the key for unwrapping the Data Protection keys, and the   device is unlocked. This process provides additional protection by requiring the Data Protection and Touch ID subsystems to cooperate in order to unlock the device."
"The keys needed for Touch ID to unlock the device are lost if the device reboots   and are discarded by the Secure Enclave after 48 hours or five failed Touch ID recognition attempts. "
"**Encryption and Data Protection**"
"The secure boot chain, code signing, and runtime process security all help to ensure that only trusted code and apps can run on a device. iOS has additional encryption and data protection features to safeguard user data, even in cases where other parts of the security infrastructure have been compromised (for example, on a device with unauthorized modifications). This provides important benefits for both users and IT administrators, protecting personal and corporate information at all times and providing methods for instant and complete remote wipe in the case of device theft or loss."
"**Hardware security features**"
"On mobile devices, speed and power efficiency are critical. Cryptographic operations   are complex and can introduce performance or battery life problems if not designed and implemented with these priorities in mind."
"Every iOS device has a dedicated AES 256 crypto engine built into the DMA path between the flash storage and main system memory, making file encryption   highly efficient."
"The device's unique ID (UID) and a device group ID (GID) are AES 256-bit keys fused (UID) or compiled (GID) into the application processor and Secure Enclave during manufacturing. No software or firmware can read them directly; they can see only the results of encryption or decryption operations performed by dedicated AES engines implemented in silicon using the UID or GID as a key. Additionally, the Secure Enclave's UID and GID can only be used by the AES engine dedicated to the Secure Enclave. The UIDs are unique to each device and are not recorded by Apple or any of its suppliers. The GIDs are common to all processors in a class of devices (for example, all devices using the Apple A8 processor), and are used for non security-critical tasks such as when delivering system software during installation and restore. Integrating these keys into the silicon helps prevent them from being tampered with or bypassed, or accessed outside the AES engine. The UIDs and GIDs are also not available via JTAG or other debugging interfaces."
"The UID allows data to be cryptographically tied to a particular device. For example, the key hierarchy protecting the file system includes the UID, so if the memory chips are physically moved from one device to another, the files are inaccessible. The UID is not related to any other identifier on the device."
"Apart from the UID and GID, all other cryptographic keys are created by the system's random number generator (RNG) using an algorithm based on CTR_DRBG. System entropy is generated from timing variations during boot, and additionally from interrupt timing once the device has booted. Keys generated inside the Secure Enclave use its true hardware random number generator based on multiple ring oscillators post processed with CTR_DRBG."
"Securely erasing saved keys is just as important as generating them. It's especially challenging to do so on flash storage, where wear-leveling might mean multiple copies of data need to be erased. To address this issue, iOS devices include a feature dedicated to secure data erasure called Effaceable Storage. This feature accesses the underlying storage technology (for example, NAND) to directly address and erase a small number   of blocks at a very low level.Ooh you are so edgy! Yeah, if you're a president or CEO. Otherwise, nobody, and I mean fucking nobody, is going around scanning your coffee cups for fingerprints and replicating them in silicon. You aren't Ethan Hunt. Nobody cares."
"Either way it's far easier to simply look over your shoulder when you type in your password.maybe not insulting everyone will get you a more positive result. "
"while I agree with you that using any kind of fingerprint technology at this stage of the game sounds *really bad* (at least to me it does)"
"I don't think people are going to respond positively by being insulted."
"just a thought.The only reason I don't is because my phone can't. It's a great idea, it's just not worth upgrading over.I use the knock code thing on LG phones, I find it easier than a pass code. Slide to unlock on android is different and in my opinion better. In iOS you have to always slide from the ~~bottom~~ left straight across to the ~~bottom~~ right; in Android you can touch anywhere and slide out in any direction to unlock."
"I'm not a lawyer or anything but I assume Apple just owns their specific implementation."
"Edit: forgot that Apple changed it so you can swipe anywhere LTR. I still like Android implimentation better but it is a step up from the old days especially on a bigger phone like the 6+.Not recently. You've been able to slide left to right anywhere on the screen since iOS 7. "
"Edit: It's not as good as sliding in any direction, but it's definitely better than it used to be. iOS you slide the whole screen anywhere you want.  It hasn't been at the bottom for ages.  Still to the right, but still. I feel that the more accurate term is swipe but that's probably patented. To me, Apple should just get rid of that text on the bottom; really contributes to the minimalistic theme. You can slide left to right anywhere on the iPhone lock screenOh yeah I forgot they changed it. It used to be the lower corner but now it's anywhere. When did that change again? I think it was iOS7..."
"I still like how Android does it because it goes in any direction.I'm not sure how android is but iOS has different actions depending on which direction you swipe, as I detailed in my response to the other guy   [deleted]When did I say you could? Every other direction has a different action though. Wait is that new? Because I have an 5th gen on iOS 8 and it can only swipe LTR. You can pull down the notification bar or pull up the control bar but that's not really part of the lock screen.Camera should work for you. "
"Frequent app will only work in certain locations (Walgreens app at Walgreens, school app while on campus, etc) and you'll see the icon for the app in the bottom left of your screen. >in any direction He said bottom left to bottom right. I clarified that it can be anywhere, as long as it's left to right."
"Swiping up opens control panel. "
"Swiping up from bottom right opens camera. "
"Swiping up from bottom left opens commonly used app for current location"
"Swiping down from top opens notifications and widgets.  I can slide in a number of ways to open up apps instead of just unlocking. Which is more useful to me than when I had an iPhone"
"Yeah, in Lollipop it's swipe up."
"And left-to-right opens the dialer. Right-to-left opens the camera.And it is awesome!! Me too. I've slid to unlock on my Android for 2 years, and half a foreknightSince no one else corrected you... the word you're looking for is fortnight.  (One fortnight is equivalent to 14 days)Foreknight? ForkKnight, deadly enemy to Baron von Knife, wedded to Lady Spoon, father of Sir Spork.It's an uncircumcised knight.Well only half way thoughIf I'm not mistaken the patent was for a symbol being swiped along a pre-defined path, which Apple doesn't even use anymore. Android phones started using a swipe anywhere idea that is really more functional in the end. The competition in the cellphone market pushed that field of technology ages beyond it's time. Compare how big of a breakthrough we considered cordless phones, or the massive zip-up bag for the carphone. These days we carry a computer more powerful than some laptops in our pocket."
"I really feel like pettiness over simple patents like this drastically slowed the growth and innovation of the field, and I'm glad to see there's light at the end of the tunnel.it's effin stupid in the first place.Another win for Germany!Its not the supreme court. Its just the highest civil court.What's a lawcase?A case that makes you Lawl?It's a term of art in Germany.The contested patent thus isn't based on an invention. - *ouch!*Patents are becoming rather unusual and ubiquitous nowadays. What was once meant for the protection of *genuine* **innovations** are now becoming tools to stop simple design ideas from being used by others. "
"You'd think the *slide to unlock* function is a virtual backbone to any touch-screen device.Good. That's a stupid thing to have a patent on.There was a patent on that? That seems really silly. fucking stupid patents for stupid shit... fuck. /rant"
"*edit patents for truly original ideas / designs are good thingsThere's a special place in hell for the technology patent trolls and the companies behind them.Good to see there is still some sense in the world.  If they had won, the legal precedence set would be disturbing.  New headline:  Ford sues Honda for developing a four-door sedan.Germany is not having any of Corporate America's shit today on the front page.  Oh, hey ArsenalOwl :DLawcase?GOOD! GOOD! *rubs hands together menacingly*Apple try to take to patent to everything like .I'm all for people getting credit for their work but patents need to be abolished entirely at this point.

It still boggles my mind how you can have patents on basic shapes that Apple clearly did not invent a rectangle with rounded corners.What about rounded corners icons? I hope apple will lose that battle too. It seems there are some Apple shareholders in this thread who are keen on quieting the voice of reason.If you ask me, anything that has a physical world counterpart shouldn't be patentable as a software device.Does that mean android can finally have just 3 dots on the pattern unlock screen?> Judges on Tuesday said that the iPhone maker's method didn't reach a level of sophistication needed to award patent protection."
"Trust me when I say nothing on that phone does."
"Seems like only Americans think that Apple invented everything.No, only Apple Fanbois.Oh good now we won't have to tear down all these medieval castles for infringing on apple's innovation."

I fail to see how slide to unlock it a valid patent.Apple has terrible business practices, and I'm glad to see that they're finally being reigned in. Another win for the consumer, fantastic. Just think they could have sued everyone who every made a dead bolt lock over the last hundred some odd years.Patent trolls should not just lose (obviously!) but also pay all court and defence expenses. Actually they should be indicted for even trying their douchebags moves. They're doing serious harm to our societies in the name of personal greed and the pursuit of personal profit!If I understand correctly, in Germany the losing party has to pay both court costs and the costs of the other side's lawyers, except for some specific instances/courts, like labor court's first instance."
"Apple on got traction in ANY country because they have the backing of the US government. With all the trade deals they can force their US based patents down any country's throat. "
"NOT because their patents(brain farts) are even worth the paper it was printed on. "
"The White house in ALL instances supports Apple's claims and screws foreign companies like Samsung with bans, etc."
"So much so that the US trade minister pleaded that they should keep their businesses in the US, regardless. Patents are such bullshit. How can anyone innovate when they have to worry about every little detail possibly being similar to something someone else, somewhere else, may have possibly created.It annoys me how a company like Apple that doesn't really invent anything sues companies that do over simple designs"
"Edit: I'm getting downvoted which means people think Apple invents things. For those people can you tell me what Apple has invented? That's not including Woz or software I'll admit those are times when Apple invents."
"Edit2: Yes I know that Apple can take existing technologies and combine them in ways that make them accessable to everyone. I don't doubt that Apple is an innovative company but considering that Apple is more of a refining than inventing company they shouldn't be able to sue other companies for huge sums of money.Troll detected.What has Apple invented after Woz then? Not including software I'll admit they have invented software stuff.[deleted]Normally I would agree I couldn't care less that Apple doesn't invent anything. But when they start suing people it annoys me because they haven't invented anything remotely worth suing for a billion dollars.

"Like, there were touchscreen phones and touchscreen tablets before the iPhone and iPad, but they kinda sucked."
"I believe that the smartphone and tablet markets today are much bigger now than they were before the iPhone and iPad primarily because Apple showed the industry the general concept of how to get smartphones and tablets right.They invented:"

"Magsafe connector"
"iPod click wheel"
"Multitouch trackpad for laptops"
"etc...>Edit: I'm getting downvoted"
"Loyal fanboys and shills.  Welcome to reddit.Have no fear brother im here to counter these fan bois have an upvoteSay something bad about Apple and watch em pour in crying, especially if it's true.

"You're despicable. I'm simply saying that although Apple hasn't necessarily invented anything all that original, they have found ways to reinvent and implement some things into their devices better than the competition.

"https://infoa2z.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/apple-iphone-vs-samsung-galaxy-s.jpg"
"They invented the...  uhh... clone tool?That's a Samsung F700. Released 2 months after the iPhone. They were initially released to developers only. It did genuine multitasking which was a real first but otherwise was ultimately a very clunky device."
"Source: me. I worked for Samsung and Sony Ericsson at the time.Of course Apple invents. The iPod with it's clickwheel stormed the portable music player market. iTunes changed how we bought and consumed music. The iPhone was the first phone that had a realistically useable touchscreen, and App Store. The MacBook boasts radically different designs to the rest of the laptop market. (The amount of times I've tripped over my charging cable and magsafe has saved my laptop)."
"Yes, a big part of Apple's success can be attributed to great marketing; and yes they have been slacking in the innovations area recently, but I'm sick to death of people ignorantly stating: Apple doesn't invent anything hurr durr.>Edit: I'm getting downvoted which means people think Apple invents things."
"_Or_ it means that people don't think other companies necessarily invent things any more than Apple does."
"We need to stop using the idiotic definition of the word invent where it means completely and never before thought of solution to a gigantic problem everyone previously thought unsolvable. The term is broader than that, as is the term innovate."
"Whether or not Apple was the absolutely unquestionably first company to _ever_ even think the thought to do the things they did, it stands beyond argument that their choices, products and designs have greatly changed the tech world as we knew it. Before the iPhone, touchscreen smartphones were a different type of product altogether, same with iPad. Whether or not they were _first_, they were definitely the most impactful and, in that sense, innovative."
"It's not enough to just _do_ something new, it has to actually work well and be something that is useful to a lot of people. Apple succeeded better with the useful part than the new part, perhaps, but it still counts, and frankly, I'm sick and tired of the anti-Apple brigade ignoring this. You're free to dislike Apple, as well as its products, but you're not free to rewrite history or Apple's importance in it.Pretty sure my Nokia 3310 had WAP on it, but it wasn't before the original iPhone that I *wanted* an Internet browser on my phone. Apple keeps showing the rest of the world how to correctly implement things, and the rest of the world promptly spends the next few years copying their implementation. Over and over and over. App Store..... Go watch the very first videos of developers talking about the OS and how different was to develop on the iPhone than so Called smartphones at that time. Yes, precisely. Touchscreen phones sucked before the iPhone, and tablets were useless to 99% of people before the iPad. They _existed_, and no one is honestly saying they didn't, but to say that the products that came before were just as good is to grossly distort the truth."
"To me, this belongs within well the term innovate. Apple takes something that doesn't work well, and reworks it into something that works _great_, and even if Apple hasn't literally invented something completely new of which no one has ever seen the likes, Apple has still contributed something and they deserve the right to protect those ideas somehow.the fanboyism in this thread. so yummy.I know it's childish, but it warms my heart to see Apple lose a case.lol if you're using slide to unlock here in 2015"

Well, at least other countries are able to provide the assistThats why TPP, TTIP and other trade deals are a thing.I know a good method to eat water melons, I have already registered it as a patent. you have been warned.All the money they waste on litigation....."
"Theoretically, isn't the only reason to patent concepts like this just to get a leg up on competitors and gain more revenue?"
"So if they go out of control and get a ton of patents, wouldn't they just have a monopoly of the market? Which governments (at least in the US) would prevent them from anyway.. so what's the point?"
"Sorry, I'm so so new to this shit, I probably sound like an idiot.. maybe someone can enlighten me.I am going to be a lawspeaker so I can do lawcases!Didn't know you could patent something so broad.Why even patent this ... Let's patent the slide to unlock thing ... the competition will never be able to unlock their phones ahhahahahahah!Apple stays in these stupid ass legal battles wtfYou should only be able to patent methods, not specific things. For example. you shouldn't be able to patent a hammer, but you should be able to patent the unique way you make hammers. If your method happens to be the obvious best, resulting in better hammers, you can sue anyone that uses the same method. For example, apple can patent the way they make the slide to unlock work, however that's the kind of source code you wouldn't make public anyway. Obviously they would never agree with this, because they know themselves that a slide to unlock mechanism would be easy enough to program by anyone with a day's experience in programming. And that's why it also feels ridiculous that these kind of things get patents in the first place. Unfortunately for Apple, most of their 'patents' aren't even worth the paper they're written on. They're just ways of hindering competition. Apple is such a piece of shit company, imo. If you want to innovate then stop patent trolling and start giving your iPhone money to causes that need help and begin to innovate technology that moves us all forward... don't sue everyone everywhere to try and fill your coffers... apple should patent been dickheads cause they do it best[deleted]Kind of like how android is copying the iOS app permissions system that's been in place for years. Funny how that works.both OS's have different features, people want those features. over time those dofferences will become smaller and smaller, that's how you stay competitive, giving the users what they want like custom keyboards in ios 8, or app permissions in android marshmallow. Germany seems to getting a lot of shit right, time to move.Apple patents fucking everything.Apple is a patent troll which is sad."
"They would patent air and sue everyone alive if they could."
"Thanks Germany."
"Das ist gut.If Germany consistently keeps pissing off Scientology and Apple fanboys, we're at least doing something right.Its not only apple but most greedy companies try to patent everything possible http://imgur.com/m24n9Cj Does this mean they lost it worldwide and permanently? This means they lost their EU patents, and, due to trade treaties, the US Patent Office would have a hard case trying to keep that patent valid in the US."
"Essentially, it's invalid in most of the world now, and in the US if you'd sue you'd instantly win, too.It's a law case, not a lawcase.  "
"Lawcase isn't a word in English.Sorry xD"
"I'm German, so I have the tendency to collapse multiple words into one ;PHindsight is 20/20.no wonder i have to slide up on my  android to unlock nowhttps://youtu.be/2LM0CZZ9Uw8Didn't John Moses Browning patent this already in 1908?All y'all complaining that it is ridiculous that 'slide to unlock' can be patented: I agree, but it's not unique to the world of modern technology. In 1779, James Pickard patented the crank mechanism, the same one seen on egg beaters, pencil sharpeners and manually operated car windows. This caused all sorts of problems for James Watt, who had to do some pretty silly things to work around the patent, his sun and planet gears.Boy have we patented it!Yeah. Now you gotta trace this apple logo to unlock <_>Good. Fuck them and fuck all these bullshit tech patents.Remember the days when companies would innovate by producing things that are actually useful, as opposed to just nice / unique looking?"
"If I were an Apple shareholder I'd be pissed off that "
"1) They're wasting money filing useless patents."
"2) They're wasting money defending said patents."
"Hey Apple.  How about you stop wasting money on attorneys and start spending money and time producing computers I actually want to buy again?[deleted]Going to patent breathe to live and see how much cash I can make...Apple is a bratty childFuck an Apple.Does this mean all iPhones will eventually lose the Slide to Unlock mechanic?No, it just means other phone OEMs can make use of the same mechanism on their phones. "
"Although to be honest people have already came up with a lot more ways to unlock phones, so it might be a bit of a moot point now. It is a moot point since phone manufacturers have had this function since before the iPad or iPhone was released. Nobody has stopped using it.Show face - Accepted. "
"Show Iris - Accepted. "
"Scan Finger - Accepted. "
"Make pattern - Accepted. "
"A loss for Apple is a win for meI was especially glad to hear that their attempt to patent the rectangle was denied.Good, shut apple down! God I hate apple.German Surpreme Court? It was the Federal Patent Court. It's also not the top civil court, that's the [BGH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Court_of_Justice_of_Germany)."
"If there's anything like a supreme court in Germany then it's the Constitutional Court(s). Apple has, technically, two other instances left: The Federal Constitutional Court, if it can argue (ha!) that our patent laws are unconstitutional, or the European Court of Justice, if it can argue (ha!) that our patent laws aren't up to EU regulations."
"A treaty to unify European patent jurisdiction has also been passed, but it's not ratified yet.This is good and relevant information, so of course it wasn't upvoted.    Please check lost and found for your lost lunchpails and lawcases.What a stupid thing to patent.  It's not innovative or technically impressive.  Anyone else's iPhone 6+ keep shutting off?You people seem to care a lot about something that's now meaningless.You mean we can't patent a gesture?!?! Coolest story bro.This is one of those things that is stupider than chicken sandwichApple wants to establish monopoly, Germany says nein, would've been a better titleWhy? Apple ripped off more then 500 patents to make the iPhone back in 2007."
"[example - LG KE850, launched in 2006 one full year before the iPhone - LG KE850 won the Red Dot Design Award and International Forum Design Award in 2007, entry dated Sep 2006 and sold 1 million units before iPhone 1st gen was launched June 29, 2007]Good, fuck apple.Hey guys! Sorry I'm late! Is this the place for the anti Steve jobs circle jerk? I hope yall have left some jerks for me!Fuck apple. Fuck reddit, too, by the way.[deleted]so steve, how's that thermonuclear war working out for you? Dude, Steve's dead. I know he's dead."
"but look what his little tantrum has caused, and honestly what could have been accomplished in the 4 years since he decided to destroy android.  before I honestly could not have cared less about what apple did because I had moved on to the android line.  but because steve decided to destroy android not through making better devices but through legal means, I am enjoying seeing apple get their rear ends handed to them legally.  all of that time and money wasted that could have been used to make better tech.  that's a loss for all of us.Can't talk to dead people, mate. Cook's continuing the Google holy war Steve initiated. Hell, Forstall was forced by Cook to make Apple Maps and ship it in iOS 6 instead of 7, and got kicked out when he pretty much said hey, it wasn't my fault you forced me to get this shit in 6 and not wait a year more.> Cook's continuing the Google holy war Steve initiated."
"Not really."
"They kept at it for a little bit, but Apple backed off a lot of the lawsuits when Jobs died, and has since been working on implementing a lot of the features that Android has had for a long time (like keyboards, the notification centre, transit direction, a battery saver mode, multi-tasking, split screen multi-tasking, widgets, Ok Google, etc.)."
">Hell, Forstall was forced by Cook to make Apple Maps and ship it in iOS 6 instead of 7, and got kicked out when he pretty much said hey, it wasn't my fault you forced me to get this shit in 6 and not wait a year more."
"Yeah, that was a hilarious fuckup, but there actually was a bit of a technical reason to it."
"Apple wanted more features from Google, but Google wouldn't give it to them without adding some Google branding to the app (placing the Google name in the bottom corner, like in Google Maps on Android), so they had to either accept Google's offer, or go a different route."
"Apple felt that paying TomTom to license their maps and dealing with the integration issues would be easier/better than adding a logo.Greedy cunts, serves them rightAt least they still invented rectangles and rounded corners. Such innovators.When Apple needs to patent simple bullshit, it just illuminates how inferior their product is. I'd be just fine with apple losing every lawsuit from now until the end of time.I'm going to patent screens that light up and the ability to adjust brightness. I want to see you try, i just filed a patent for light and brightness. Don't you dare to infringe on my intellectual property!Oh well?Suck shit, cultists. patents are dumb, least in this case.Eat a dick Apple.Eat an apple, dick.I see many apple fanboys are downvoting coments here...brothers I shall save you and grant you back these upvotes...in the name of android!Looks like you got down-voted. Talk about irony!Apple finaly being put in it's place...Good.  Pretty much everything patented these days should have been unpatentable.  Not novel.  Not new.  Many times not even functional."
"My solution is to limit patents to 10 per year (i'd do 5 but i'm being generous).  There aren't even close to 10 inventions per year that are truly new and unique and worthy of a patent.  Sticking a stamp dispenser on the back of a cellphone is not worthy of a patent (let alone the 50 it would get).  The problem is the USPTO has to fund itself, congress won't give it any money, and it's gotten very adept at making billions of dollars per year from patent application fees, patent grant fees, etc.  "
"10 patents a year.  No more.  Granted at the end of each year to the 10 most worthy new inventions.  If you invent a teleportation machine, a room temperature superconductor, or a quantum computer, you can have one patent.  Short of that, no.I don't even use a lock screen, it's only a waste of time. I've never had my screen turn on in my pocket.How would you know if your screen turned on in your pocket?Well, some apps would turn on, something would happen... right?"
"Oh and, thanks for the downvotes, my comment is clearly some offensive bullshit and I deserved it.Battery life and haptic feedback.and if you pulled your phone out and the screen was on Why? Why ist that photo upside down?!??Right side up photos are patented.I feel like the patent trolling between major tech companies has slowed down in general.This isn't r/nottheonion...[deleted]It's also not even their invention but a copy on top of it.Apple is the Taylor Swift of the electronics industry.Good ideas  in general  are copied  by many companys ,"

"Only the premium model phones have fingerprint  readers,"
"most phones use slide to unlock  .Phase one of Software Patents are a Joke complete.So how are you going to unlock your apple products now? do you lick the screen?Android nerds just can't comprehend that Apple products are built better, look better and are a pleasure to use. They are the greatest consumer electronics products on the planet right now. The brand is cool, consumer satisfaction levels are high, it hasn't come close to becoming diluted yet because it's a higher end product and not a cheap product, so it maintains its allure "
"There will be backlash one day, cause nothing can stay on top forever, but I can't see any existing company taking the reigns cause Android products all suck and are inferior. If someone is going to take over from Apple, it will be a new company in the future Well, I agree, Apple phones are amazingly well designed and marketed - their products usually just work(tm)."
"But their products are good because they copy the best ideas of others and combine them into an even better product."
"Patents, sadly, are the reason why this copy, combine and improve process is stopped. And that is just bad for everyone, including Apple users."
"Look at the notification center, or the new cross-app communication via modules in iOS 8."
"They were only possible because Apple copied from other companies, combined their ideas, and improved upon them."
"In the same way that these companies copied, combined and improved upon ideas from Apple before."
"Innovation doesn't happen in a bubble, but through copying, combining and improving."
"Patenting prevents this.You had me falling over at built better. Couldn't stop laughing"
"Apple Admits Siri Voice Data is Being shared with Third Parties - DigitalMunitionSomeone recently posted about how their job was to review everything people say to Siri. Did he ever post proof?And everyone accused him of being a liar...This was actually the source for this lame assed article. The original thread was more informative.That reddit post is basically all the proof the linked article has. They don't cite to Apple admitting anything, except for what is in the License Agreement. Between that and the numerous typos and spelling mistakes, the article is worthless.Funny you say that. The article starts with that thread.They won't like what I say to Siri then when I accidentally trigger it and get annoyed. Shut the fuck up and I will kill you."
"I surmise they will send me information on anger management in the near future.It's always a ''conspiracy theory'' until there is an official word about it. Even though there is tons of evidence.You didn't bother to read the article did you?Haha, glad I wasn't the only one that recalled this! MAN it really blew up!That's awesome. Siri and I have such a dysfunctional relationship. I hope they enjoy going through to all wonderful things I've said when she hasn't given me the answer I want or need. The worst is when you accidentally summon her. I tell her to shut up frequently. The SO of one of my coworkers works at a place that works with this data. It's got an office in the Seattle area.[Sounds like a decent way to make a living](http://i.imgur.com/7V6ZB.gif)Hey, I remember that! Very weird job.I had a job doing the same thing for XBox. You just tag the parts of speech in order to improve its sentence parsing. And yes, it was through a third party. I remembered that too lol We should all just start sending vulgar messages to whoever is listening to the recordings, through Siri. Not saying that apple don't share data, but holy shit that title was misleading!People do that on crowdsourcing websites. I've done it personally on Amazon Mechanical Turk, which is a site where people post tasks that require collective mental manpower for dimes to a dollar. I got samples of stuff that people said to their phones and had to transcribe them or confirm an existing transcription. I was surprised that I could access those recordings, but didn't think it was a big deal since everything was anonymous. Yep. That post is all the first third of this article talks about.That's what the article says, right?"
"And that's pretty much all it says. You're a better writer.A reddit post about an article about a reddit post. Deja Vu Which was cited in the article itself, this is so meta-recursive.You mean [this thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2wzmmr/everything_youve_ever_said_to_siricortana_has/): *I heard everything from kiddos asking innocent things like Siri, do you like me? to some guy asking Galaxy to lick his butthole. I wish I was kidding.*  "
"EDIT: A lot of butthole licking going on in my inbox. &#3232;_&#3232;if you can't tell from the word Galaxy that OP was referring solely to Samsung's products.So, it includes Android and Windows Phones, but only Apple is being mentioned in the discussion?Except where they said someone mentioned 'siri'.Indirectly.Don't you know you're supposed to lick it before you stick it? Eh... I say shit like that to my phone all the time mostly out of boredom. And I suppose because I'm immature. Bick my lutthole.To be fair, after having tried to use S-voice on a Note 4, I can safely say that Galaxy can lick my butthole, and I'd gladly say it to its face.Galaxy lick my butthole. this phrase pales in comparison to the shit I say. I want some hardcore quotes. Any takers? I feel bad for that person because the only thing I ever ask her is What's the weather for this week? And What's the name of this song?Yeah but who cares? I used to do transcription work of the same kind and there's no identifiable information tied to the sound bites, they're totally anonymous. I'm wondering if that person is now unemployed.Obvious jokes were obvious.  I've seen first hand people fucking with siri trying to get funny responses.  Seriously, that's like the first thing I did when I got siriI would imagine listening to kids say that shit all day would get annoying.Hey Siri, is the guy who reviews these comments a total douchenozzle?Wow that butthole licking thing mightve been me.My first thought when I read that. That was just about the first thing I said to Galaxy when I got my phone. I'm sure *lots* of people have asked Galaxy to lick their butthole. I actually asked it hoping some voice log guy would have to listen to me asking at some point.Yes, he does mean..."
"> FallenMyst, a Reddit user claimed to had recently started a new job with a company called Walk N' Talk Technologies, where job profile requires her to listen voice data collected from Apple, Microsoft users and check for incorrect interpretations."
">I get to listen to sound bites [sic] and rate how the text matches up with what is said in an audio clip and give feedback on what should be improved. Fallenmyst wrote. Guys, I'm telling you, if you've said it to your phone, it's been recorded...and there's a damn good chance a 3rd party is going to hear it,"
"...the thread **quoted in the article itself.** People please read before heading to the comments.Why does it say sound bites [sic] when it's spelled correctly?No idea. Maybe he edited it after the fact.It's funny because that week there was a person of interest episode in which they showed that companies did this. It was supposed to be a big conspiracy or something and then bam: reality!This isn't a conspiracy, it's routine quality control."
"You people are morons.Outsourcing work on better voice recognition is a consipiracy?Holy shit, companies outsource labor?!Hardly a consipracy. I'm willing to bet a trillion dollars that it's in Apple's ToS.But you still post on reddit."
"If you don't think every single one of our reddit posts aren't being datamined, and user data is being sold by reddit to fund this website, then you're naive. "
"There's being good evidence through #modleaks that there's manipulation of questions on askreddit, and that problematic context is curated by mods, in the interest of keeping this site commercial desirable. Pedantry time:  You mean supposed to be a big conspiracy *theory*."
"A conspiracy is just the agreement between parties to act together, usually subversively, whether they commit that act or not. The fact that it happened, and is now public knowledge with empirical evidence, does not mean it is not a conspiracy any more - however it does mean it is no longer just a theory.Almost as if it was all planned...DUN DUN DUNAFAIK on the show the big deal is that they were easily able to connect the recording to a person's name.  That isn't the case here.Oh ffs! Spoilers, dude!But the conspiracy wasn't about people listening to voice searches. It was that the app was changing results and encouraging people to kill them self. That's next week's newsThat poster also didn't answer the question about whether it was possible for him to know who said any of those things.  Presumably it's next to impossible."
"I really don't see the privacy impact if you can't connect the voice to a person's identity."
"Person of interest is really good with things like this, i completely disregarded the show at first but fell in love with the light hearted conspiracy theories and technology combo.  I remember thinking before the whole NSA thing this show is a little ridiculous sometimes, that would never happen"
"But then it happened and I thought oh fucking hell the show is coming trueTo be fair, it's what you consent to whEn you activate Siri. Nobody makes a secret here. I'm personally more astonished that so many people seem unaware."
"Sorry for the split comment Have you tried the edDid not find that on that App that I was using (Redd). Will check out others.It button?I don't think s/he knows about that.I'm really surprised how people were unaware of this being a thing. It is mentioned right in the agreement and you KNOW it only works with an Internet connection. "
"Why is everybody surprised? Because people assume good faith. They shouldn't.people also use free email services from google et al."
"they have been looking at your emails for years. "
"funny how users have always been comfortable with that...To be fair. With email no one is actively checking it. Just scanning through it and flagging keywords for ads. "
"With Siri/S-Voice and (I think?) Google Now - people were claiming that their job was to actually listen to it. To be fair, with Gmail the data gathered is aggregated against your account. Google uses it to target advertising."
"Apple is having a company do QA on completely anonymous sound clips, that are never associated back to you.Good point. "
"So it's a computer that knows who you are Vs. a person that doesn;t? Seems about equal to me.>  Google uses it to target advertising."
"And if there is one thing I hate - it's advertisements that are relevant to me. I mean, I literally have never found a single product that I did not know about because on advertisement. /sDoesn't make sense. People assume the government is out there to track their every move and they don't expect this from a mega corporation? HaI made a program to help testers review our own voice data. It's still in good faith when we do it, and the article makes it look like they're doing what we do."
"Siri uses a Nuance engine. We use Nuance. Microsoft's Cortana uses Nuance. Darn near everyone who does NL speech recognition is using Nuance. A majority of speech recognition in general is done through Nuance. When something is listening to you talk, just assume it's Nuance."
"Nuance needs a lot of tuning to be reasonably accurate. The more things you try to recognize, the worse your recognition accuracy and confidence get. So, naturally, you start paring down or re-weighing your options to improve user experience."
"No one is doing this to get your super secret data, because that's *one gigantic waste of time*. Your interaction with Apple's servers (in Siri's case) or with an automatic phone system (in our case) *is logged to hell and back*. If you want to get analytics out of your customers, you use the machine-friendly, preprocessed text logs.Surprising how many conspiracies are true nowadays.well.. there are conspiracies and there are other... more extreme conspiracies..."
"it doesnt mean that the endless ocean of bullshit conspiracies is even close to being true.Says a JIDF member. still waiting on my pay check from the jewmenati NWO.Conspiracies are a thing of the past with our new connected world.  People talk.  You mean how many conspiracies we prove to be true. Moon landing? Pffft.http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-cias-invention-of-the-conspiracy-theorist-smear-campaign-to-discredit-dissenters/5403876/r/actualconspiracies is a thing. Why is conspiracy in quotes? As though calling something a conspiracy implies that it's not true?Yet, before the truth is exposed by mainstream media, the people sharing those conspiracies get falsely accused and verbally abused, especially on Reddit and with the source policing. You can't just throw everything at the wall, see what sticks, and then shout about being right disregarding all of the times people were wrong.I recently watched the documentary TWA 800 and the US Government did indeed cover up the Navy shooting down accidentaly the 747 bound for France. The documentary featured numerous NTSB personnel who were obstructed by the FBI from doing their jobs or realeasing their findings at the inquiry. Not one witness to the accident was allowed to testify either.Not much of a conspiracy if it's explicitly written in a user agreement contract...Nowadays"
"The true conspiracies of an era become history, and the false ones come to be considered silly. There has been lots of points in history when a conspiracy theory turns out to be true and becomes history."
"Look at various USA interventions in Africa/South America that were super shady and only admitted by the CIA years later (or after undeniable evidence appeared). Look at the corruption in the police force in america back when the mafia were at their peak. I can't think of any other obvious examples but the fact is that history is full of things that were kept secret at the time, so it's not a recent trend that conspiracies are coming true."
"It is quite possible, though, that the internet is giving a voice to people that would otherwise be silenced/ignored, and so more stuff is coming to lightt hat would otherwise take decades to emerge if at allThe internet also just throws every physically possible scenario at the wall and when one pans out they're like ooooooh shit I knew it!  Well...  You also said the President and his cabinet were lizard people so lets just call it a wash."
"> Look at the corruption in the police force in america back when the mafia were at their peak."
"Not just police.  FBI also.  Whitey Bulger is an excellent example of that.Huh, cool."
"Don't know anything about it tbh, was just an example of where the truth was shady. I'll look it up!He bribed the FBI agent in charge of investigating him into feeding him information on FBI operations, and used the information to evade the authorities, amongst other horrible and nefarious things."
"The movie The Departed is loosely based on him.  Except in reality, Whitey infiltrated the FBI, not the Boston police department.  Well, he probably infiltrated BPD too, he just wasn't limited to local law enforcement. But those people are still ridiculed like they were back when the internet did not exist. Even more so now. I don't say that every conspiracy has a right for existance. There is some really retarded things coming from /r/conspiracy, but that doens't mean that everyone there is a conspiratard. Knowing US history as you mentioned, why is it a stretch to consider that what happened during the Arab Srping or Maidan to be CIA plots, when there are things like the Gulf of Tonkin incident or the bringing Sadam Hussein to power?Often they're ridiculed, but often they're not."
"Manning, Snowden and Assange have all had absolutely huge impacts on global politics through the internet's power to give a voice to normal people. The things that they leaked could easily have been discarded as conspiracy nonsense if not for the ability to easily communicate information such that it can't ever be removed/destroyed like physical evidence can."
"The problem with being a 'cinspiracy theorist' is that by definiton that makes you somebody who is gulible. Lots of conpiracy theories have some merit, but a person who believes that a wide range of fringe things are all true is a conspiritard. Imo it's perfectly reasonable to have your suspicions, but places like /r/conspiracy almost encourage a kind of irrational, baseless distrust of all statements from any 'authority' that makes them difficult to take seriously.The term 'conspiracy theorist' has come to equate people who question the official story of all sorts of things (Kennedy assassination, Behghazi) with people who believe the Queen is a lizard. Thus it discredits questioners by lumping them in with fantasists.Well that's why you should never call yourself a conspiracy theorist."
"Like I said, lots of theories have real, but if you doubt EVERYTHING that demonstrates a poor ability to judge truth, not a healthy doubt of the official story."
"I don't put much faith in the honesty of our leaders, but I don't put much faith in their ability either. I think that, in almost every case, what 'questioners' attribute to malice is usually explained by incompetence with a healthy dose of individual greed."
"That said, I think Adam Curtis is pretty much the best documentary-make ever and that his shit is very convincing, which might label me as a conspiracy theorist in some peoples' eyes."
"What's mainstream in some places (for example the entire rich world besides america tends to take the side of the Palestinians in Israel) is often fringe/extremist in another. Adam Curtis documentaries are funded and shown on the BBC in the UK, but the ideas they express would be considered extreme-left propaganda in mcuh of the USA.> Well that's why you should never call yourself a conspiracy theorist."
"Does anyone do this anymore or did they ever?"
"I only hear the term when someone has a problem hearing new information that questions their tightly held assumptions, and they lash out with a bullshit label to deflect that information."
"The term was always about undercutting real criticism and information about how the real world works with petty bickering and obfuscation."
"Sounds like something the Queen lizard would WANT you to think.......I believe the proper title is Her Royal Highness Queen Elizardbeth II but I'm not an expert. Thanks for making this point. As a former mod of r/conspiracy, i understand exactly how valuable original first sources are (and those requesting sources) and at the same time, to really flesh out true conspiracies, there has to be a little bit of room for speculation and then the research of claims... "
"Just like the pedophile ring that was exposed  by a user on r/conspiracy, sometimes speculation and trying to justify claims can open avenues of recearching corruption that wouldnt have been undertaken otherwise..."
"Conspiracy?  It's in the terms of use that you agreed to and everyone must read.  They can also sew your mouth onto another man's butthole. To be fair, in the episode it was the company who made the voice software itself that was also checking the user input and comparing it to how the software transcribed it. It wasn't a third party."
"Also, I've noticed that Person of Interest is surprisingly realistic and sane when it comes to what is possible with technology. Even if it is about artificial intelligences taking over the world. Their attention to technical detail is surprisingly good.When dealing with the maker of the phone or OS, they are first party. Any sort of software company not tied directly to their products, even if their included as a feature, would be third party. I was talking about the Person of Interest episode. Person of Interest is a TV show."
"The episode featured a fictional company that had written voice command software for an unspecified mobile platform. They wrote the voice command software, it was their product, and they had no direct relation to any mobile OS company (beyond writing software for their unnamed platform)."
"The single company featured in the episode both wrote the software, and was listening to user requests to make sure the transcribing matched and the given search results were relevant."
"It had no relation to Apple, Siri, Google, or Google Now (though if I remember correctly, there were some parallels to early Google; I think the company owned a 'popular search engine' with a fictional name, and was a small, rapidly growing company).Because its totally not possible that Apple buys that research right back from the third party right? Because who covers their ass in the age of information...Still completely unrelated. It's a fictional TV show about a fictional company making a fictional product in a fictional Universe. Apple and Google don't even exist.Excuse me,how the hell is it unrelated? We learned a couple weeks ago that third parties go through siri for marketing purposes and now apple has openly admitted to selling it's siri data to third parties."
"So what's to say they don't buy that analyzed data straight back from the third parites?> Excuse me,how the hell is it unrelated?"
"Because my post was specifically talking about a TV show episode, and not any real life situation - no matter how similar some real life situations may be."
"It may be related to the overall topic of this post, but it's unrelated to this comment thread - especially the comment you actually responded to.Wait, that's what that show's about? Color me interested. It does build up somewhat slowly, but you learn more about the characters and what's going on, and their pasts, as the show progresses. Very good show.Go watch it, it's great. just bare with the first season. It's episodic at that point. In season 2 it becomes more serial. Each season the show just gets better and better, season 4 the current one is my favourite by far.An AI that listens to every microphone, watches every camera, and helps the goverment and the main protagonists solve crimes."

Even if it is about artificial intelligences taking over the world. Their attention to technical detail is surprisingly good."
"They have a surprising track record of being right on the money. Usually the conspiracy they choose to showcase shortly turns out to be true."
"I remember they had an episode about how all the internet feeds in the world are monitored right before PRISM became public.So PoI is being directed by the Illuminati then.> I remember they had an episode about how all the internet feeds in the world are monitored"
"That's kind of the premise of their show. But yeah, it pre-dates PRISM by two years.Yeah but they had an episode that focused specifically on a flashback about how they started a massive program to tap all the internet feeds when the machine was created. One month later PRISM was revealed.Warming you up to the idea then when they release the information you don't really care about it."
"The idea (and practice) have been around for decades, not years, even before the Internet there where government signals intelligence programs that intercepted and monitored all kinds of electronic communication (phone, fax, bank transfers etc) on a grand scale.  See [ECHELON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON)Echelon was old news when the show started or the ill lit magic lantern burning the oil of [Total Information Awareness] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Information_Awareness). "
"One of their quick reference shots of code used by one of the leads for hacking had snippets of Stuxnet in it. I would be extremely surprised if their writers don't have a healthy set of contacts in the tech security sector, they're really good at delivering relevant scenarios.Hm. In one episode, it shows The Machine monitoring a gang's online activity... And in the bottom corner of the screen, it says it's decrypting TOR."
"I wonder if that's accurate/true as well.It kind of is."
"The thing with TOR is that it gives you anonymity but not privacy. That means an exit node can see all the traffic and what it contains but it doesn't know where it is coming from."
"Now... here is where it gets hairy: if you control the majority of the nodes on the network you can use an algorithm that triangulates the source of the traffic. Basically the algorithm plays whack-a-mole until it finds the source but it can only do that if it has control over the majority of the network."
"Who runs the most nodes? The US government."
"It gets even stranger: anyone can run a node. The TOR network doesn't have an allegiance. So every once in a while something really strange happens to the network: it gets flooded with new nodes. Sometimes, someone with a lot of funding floods the network with new nodes."
"This has a few consequences: when the network is flooded the US government can't triangulate anymore. However if this someone is a single entity then they now have triangulation power and they can identify a lot of people on the network."
"Who is this someone? A lot of people suspect China. Other say it's not one entity but whatever corporation needs to use the TOR network at that moment. "
"Whatever the case control of the TOR network boils down to how many nodes you can put on the network. So whoever has the money to keep the most servers running has temporary control."
"This is all very cyberpunk.In that case, you could ban/block nodes in your for configuration....but that would (as you said) be the majority of the network.So we have seed boxes.  Why not TOR boxes?But isn't there a system TOR uses to prevent new nodes from getting all the traffic if there's a flood of them?Complete layman here but how do you make a node?sign up to digitalocean."

I tried reading the documentation but it went over my head.Iirc Snowden said don't use tor.But he uses TAILS, doesn't he? As I understand, all internet traffic on TAILS runs through TOR, unless you use the unsecured browser.He did recommend tails. I wish I could find it, maybe he said don't use only tor Without other measures in place. "
"Technical question, couldn't tor be made much more secure if a billionaire donated a couple billion  worth of nodes? Like wonder who the first philanthropist will be who does something like that.That is fascinating. A real opportunity for a great cyberpunk, corporate conspiracy thriller in that concept. It's a pity Michael Crichton is dead...Excuse me, but William Gibson is alive and well!Neil Stephenson as well> Who runs the most nodes? The US government."
"This is simply not true. At most, the US government possibly owns 5-10% of the tor exit relays. Jacob Appelbaum has talked about this before and debunked it."
">So every once in a while something really strange happens to the network: it gets flooded with new nodes. Sometimes, someone with a lot of funding floods the network with new nodes."

"Don't curse at me or I'll tell your wife about those searches.The answer would be no. They're paying the third parties to handle parts of the voice recognition, not selling it. I don't think they're selling it. I'm pretty sure they're actually *paying* those third parties to work on it.[She's coming across a lot more suss than that](http://imgur.com/bQSgb4Z)"
"UPDATE: [Now she's just being an asshole about it](http://imgur.com/eH5SGC9)[*FTFY](https://imgur.com/gallery/2woA375/new)She actually says, no comment, nameNo comment, short for I'm guilty but can you prove it?I once asked Siri if she was working with the Feds."
"She told me I don't have to answer that, nameSiri, you have to tell me if you're a cop.Seems like a joke at face value but now...Where admits apparently means clearly states [in the] iOS Software License Agreement.did you read it?Hello, AppleYes, it's clearly stated in 3 point font somewhere in 1.5 million words.  It's right there.Instead of having to read every single user agreement, people should just assume that each user agreement is as bad as legally possible.  That way you only have to know one set of laws instead of each agreement's particulars."
"It's naive to pretend firms aren't soliciting consent for the entirety of what is legally available to them anyway.  Basically, why would you assume any of the stipulations they are allowed to impose aren't present?I doubt people feel that even if the agreement says that Apple *could* do something, that they actually do go ahead and do it. Especially since the agreement is so huge, it almost feels like we are agreeing to allow them to do whatever they want. It doesn't mean they actually *should* on a mass scale.No, not clearly.Human CentiPad.I said this elsewhere:"
"I don't think it's as clear cut that subsidiaries and agents encompass all third parties. Both are legal terms of art and would not cover all third parties. For example, if Apple was sending your Siri data to a local McDonalds, this would clearly not be covered."
"There is a line somewhere. The question is where is that line, and who is receiving the data. You are right. This isn't news. Siri coming back with wikipedia snippets and weather data from yahoo.com for instance should make it abundantly clear they are connecting siri to 3rd parties even if you didn't read the eula. And of course people ask siri to 'lick their butthole' or other non-sense... after it was discovered that there were some easter eggs in the program people are curious as to what the response will be. "
"The problem I have with EULAs is that they are very vague, blanket statements. "
"subsidiaries' and agents' transmission, collection, maintenance, processing, and use of this information, including your voice input and User Data"
"It's one thing to collect the data and process it to help improve the programs grammar or text to voice (which imo should be in-house not 3rd party, but apparently that's not the case). It is something else entirely to send my personal contact information and search history to an advertising agency. This statement seems to allow both. I highly doubt that voice data goes to Wikipedia. That's not what they mean. You aren't really on topic with your last statement. The companies that are listening to you for real have no idea who you are, are not given your identity, and they don't get to send you anything."
"The companies who produce the software to decipher language compare what you did say to what the software interpreted it as. They use this to make the voice software better by focusing on tricky words and phrases. "
"Its the same when people say 'google Sells my info when in reality they don't sell your info, they sell the ability to serve you ads you like. The company pays for x ads to show up on the web pages viewed by people who are more likely to buy. "
"If Apple is selling my metadata with my personal information, like Facebook, that'd be scary news. But it isn't. It's contracting menial voice recognition quality control to another company. The people listening to the voices 1) don't know anything about the person they're listening to and 2) listen to so many they're not going to remember 99% of what they hear. "
"If you want voice recognition, this is how it's done. How else do people think the computer becomes better at recognizing what you're saying? This isn't a scandal, it's a how the sausage is made moment. I'm not sure why it matters that Apple is using contractors. Ah the massive agreement with the length of a small bookYou don't read it? At least tell me you email t to yourself! "
"Seriously, this kind of things are explained to us in black and white. It's partly our fault for not contesting it instead of just not reading and getting pissy when we agreed to something we ended up not liking. /s"
"Edit: Forgot the sarcasm tag. You don't read it? Give me a break, literally no one is reading user agreements because what is says doesn't change the fact you have to accept it to continue using your iPhone/software/whatever. No one's arguing contract legality here, it's a matter of an expectation of privacy and certain moral and ethical grounds we're seeing being further stepped on. LOL it's in the agreement doesn't excuse itI just tell WINE not to display EULAs.If i had to read every single fucking End User Agreement for every widget i bought or every service i signed up for, i wouldn't have any free time and it'd probably cut into my work time too. Regardless, that's your choice. You're essentially signing a contract when you accept the TOS for a product. If you choose not to read that contract, the liability falls on you. "
"RTFM.A guy calculated how long it'd take to read everything a typical person agrees to online. Something like 250 hours per year. and it's written by lawyers. Are you a lawyer? I'm not...Have you tried reading one of those things?  A layperson wouldn't understand 90% of it.  I bet the legalese of some (most) statements would stumble some lawyers too.Its also on the siri wikiipediaAhh, I see the part about sending your speech to third parties, right below the part that allows Apple to turn you into a [HumancentiPad]( https://vimeo.com/24782590).Actually their privacy policy is in plain english on their webpage."

The information isn't personally identifiable. And it's just being used to hear what a user said and check whether what Siri understood was correct or not. It's like giving a training set to a ML algorithm! This is how  Siri learns!Still no mention of selling to third party."
"I give you my data to improve your service and know me better as a customer, I do not agree to allow whoever happens to be the high bidder next week to have my data."
"That's the big difference. Not the data collection, the data selling without any knowledge, or any of the money, going to the person whose data is getting sold."
"Edit: [google don't do that shit](http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/), check out number 4. Google makes my life awesome by collecting and using my data to serve me better, and they make money by advertising directly to me. I'm fine with that tradeoff, and they're transparent about how they do it. And they don't sell it to unknown potentially untrustworthy third parties.They never said they sell it to a third party. They are actually paying the third party they are sharing the data with. They share it with them so they can verify it's accuracy, they aren't selling it to a company so they can use that data in their marketing. They're doing exactly what you said was ok for them to do, they are just hiring a third party to go through it for them. It still doesn't say it's shared with 3rd parties.I really don't care what apple does with people's data but none of those points you posted say anything about third parties. Go to their page and read the policy, you know, for yourself. "
"Read the part about third parties.  "
"It's not hard.   It says that it is only exposed to third parties to do work, like a contracted call center verifying you. "
"Just read for yourself. It's so incredibly clear and available in every conceivable language.  It's so incredibly clear, yet you pasted a big blurb that had nothing to do with third parties."
"The clarity is palpable.I'm not a lawyer, but the we basically includes third party companies Apple uses to do those things. "
">you agree and consent to Apple's and its subsidiaries' and agents' transmission"
"Basically no big deal.You can't use Siri without first seeing this and turning it on. http://i.imgur.com/ORNVzs0.jpg"
"It very clearly states that your voice recordings will be sent to Apple. I'm not sure how they can be more clear without ending up with a document that hides what they're doing due to its length. Luckily, the EULA is also easily accessible for people who want more details about what's done with the data.huh, that's actually quite nice. Then I have nothing to complain about.[deleted]You can say that about every electronic communications you will ever use.Apple would be the 2nd party, not the 3rd .Nothing about that notice says it will go to third parties.[deleted]It's simply someone they paid to analyze data. The third party does not get to use the data for their own benefit. I don't see a difference, privacy wise, between a third party company handling the hiring, setting up the office, etc or Apple.[deleted]From a privacy perspective I don't see the difference at all.  There's nothing special about Apple employees that makes me think my data would be more secure processed by them than another company they have hired to do the processing.  I expect all data I hand to Apple to be handed off to a third party.  For example, when I ask Siri a question I assume the query is potentially going to any number of back end search engines to attempt to get me a result.  That seems obvious.  Sending my voice to the voice analysis company is not different or special in that regard.[deleted]The single sentence marketing summary of what Siri is that's included in that screenshot is not the terms you're agreeing to.[deleted]Well you do have a point. "
"But the issue here is third parties. The message doesn't state that data is send to third parties. Only to Apple. Isn't sending to a third patty different? As in there is an additional company with this information?It's simply someone they paid to analyze data. The third party does not get to use the data for their own benefit. I don't see a difference, privacy wise, between a third party company handling the hiring, setting up the office, etc or Apple.I just want to know what happened to the first and second patties. the police were called, parties were shut downI want to know what happened to the Dufresnes. In a roadshow museum for dimwits somewhere, labeled probably still edible, what do they make these things out of!?They went to the baker's man.Squidward ate them. they were combined with special sauce, lettuce, pickles, and onions, all on a sesame seed bun.You are the first, and Apple is the second.[deleted]An apple patty sounds gross.Art thou feeling it now Mr. Krabs?Patties, not parties. The original question was Isn't sending to a third ***patty*** different?AW, everybody knows there 'aint no sanity clause.This is a contracted business, hired by Apple to analyze voice data.  A brand new employee decided to break his NDA for Karma, AND he told the name of the company.  Good bye job."
"First, assuming it works like a contracted call center, the company will have a secure connection to Apple.  The data would unlikely ever actually end up on the contracted companies hard drives.  Everything is delivered through a Citrix session over VPN, so it's more of an extension of Apple's network."
"I was in a similar position working for a call center doing tech support in Canada for a US bank.  We would use words like Zee because they were often confused about Zed, and due to the online savings nature of the bank, we had regular calls from the rich and famous.  Also had some IBM analytic tools to look at mobile numbers for millions of customers, all fun stuff but I'd never disclose anything concrete."
"This is an extremely common practice.  When Apple or MS had a large campaign (Lion Release, Windows 8 release), this very same call center in Canada does overflow work during large rollouts."
"The only difference here is some yahoo sang about his job on his first day.Just to clarify - the company was using crowdsourcing to tackle the transcription quality analysis and answer relevancy. Pretty much every major company, including Google, has been doing this with crowdsourced workers for awhile. While some of them may have NDAs, not all will and the user in this case did not. "
"That said, honestly, it really shouldn't be that big of a privacy concern to most people. That vast majority of things said into Siri, Cortana or Google's equivalent are going to be innocuous and no crowdsourced worker will have access to the entirety of your inputs but rather only a random sampling of many user's inputs. Presumably before sending out the voice data and results for analysis, they'd also pre-scrub anything that looks like it may have contained sensitive password or account name information. "
"By and large, crowdsourcing is pretty innocuous and even given direct information about you, the vast majority of the crowd is going to be too pre-occupied just trying to earn a few more cents to do have time to do anything bothersome with it. I used to work at a crowdsourcing vendor and, as a joke, a fellow employee had some people look up my LinkedIn account. He meant to have it be ~5 people so I'd be like Who the heck are these people? but accidentally ran it to about ~200. I woke up to seeing 200 random people from all over the world having visited my profile but no messages or anything from any of them making any further steps to contact me or share my information elsewhere (from what I can tell).>  While some of them may have NDAs, not all will and the user in this case did not."
"Highly unlikely, unless you have a source.  This user posted a paragraph."
"Apple would FOR SURE have it in their contract, and any of their policies obviously grandfather down."
"Just speaking from experience, working for a call center, that contracted to Apple and Microsoft.Go read through the user's posts. It was a HIT offered via a crowdsourcing platform called CrowdFlower (a MechanicalTurk like service). Virtually anyone who wanted to could have gone on to work on it. If Apple had it in their contract, they company they worked with failed to follow through. I think a lot of people would feel alarmed if they knew how much private data is passed between various companies and vendors, and almost all of the security and privacy being contingent on a simple NDA. The industry has been like this forever. I'm not saying it's the best system or even secure, but it's the way things are done. Source: worked for an e-commerce vendor and saw some pretty interesting customer data provided by a big US investment firm. Apple is not a 3rd party[deleted]The agreement is between you and Apple. That's what first second and third party refers to. Your phone is not a party.[Speak for yourself!](http://i.imgur.com/io2a45d.jpg)No apple is the second party. Siri is a computer."
"Don't know why you're defending them so hard.Apple fanboyYou don't have to be a fanboy of something to defend it. It's simply someone they paid to analyze data. The third party does not get to use the data for their own benefit. I don't see a difference, privacy wise, between a third party company handling the hiring, setting up the office, etc or Apple.>The third party does"
"I don't give a damn what a third party gets to use my voice recording for. I don't want them to have it at all. I did **not** agree to allow Apple (a principle party) to share with anyone else. Thank you for that screenshot that confirms that, btw."
"This situation is A: not speculation and B: not what I signed up for. Well that's not what we agreed to based on your screenshot.>  The third party does not get to use the data for their own benefit."
"I don't care. All you big business shills need to realize that just because it's common practice for Apple/Google/Microsoft to share your data with Joe Schmo down the street doesn't make it *right*. "
"And just because someone uses a service by one of these companies does not mean that everyone read *and understood* the ToS, and it's *fucking asinine* to suggest that people do or should. "
"The fact that people *constantly* complain about the way their data is handled is evidence that we need better regulation over these service providers, and *we* need to be deciding what happens with our data, not each company on a case by case basis.  The system needs to change."
"Bu... but you don't understand, apple never violates any of your priv-"
"Shut the fuck up I don't care what you think because you're some guy on the internet. There is plenty of evidence that all of these large companies only respect privacy when they're exposed for not doing so. "
"Rather than making excuses everytime we hear about big business taking advantage of the stupid, why don't we, you know, *do something about it*?."
"But I'm sure most of the people on reddit are so smart though they don't need to worry about accidently using a service on someone elses phone or a phone that was a gift or just some random site on the internet. Do you have any source for accusing Google, in particular? My understanding, and everything I have read, lines up with the idea that  selling data or giving it to 3rd parties is conducive to Google's business model of using the data they collect themselves to provide targeted ads. "
"I'm not saying they don't, I've just never seen anything that suggested they do.If you don't feel what they are doing is reasonable, then you can do something about it, you can opt out of using that feature."
"There are a lot of things they have to cover in their ToS, it's going to be big, should we be forced to read it and acknowledge line by line that we understand?"
"Before we start calling each other fanboys, the following can apply to most tech companies offering voice recognition."
"1. They openly state that they are going to send the voice data to third parties in their ToS."
"2. This is used to improve the service."
"3. They anonymize and encrypt the data (Samsung didn't, which is a separate issue)."
"That sounds reasonable to me.  I understand that some people might not think that's reasonable, and they can opt out of using voice recognition.Personally I think that social networking and AI is a huge paradigm when it comes to human interaction, and currently the way we treat our data is as if it's a commodity. "
"Perhaps we, as a human race, can come together and recognize that we will be using these tools for as long as humanity continues to advance, and rather than letting companies decide on a case by case basis how our data is handled, it should be up to society to decide some basic rules. "
"Rather than having to agree to certain conditions whenever we use a service, all service providers should have to adhere to strict standards and regulation, alleviating the need for such agreements."
"People forget how easy it is to even *accidentally* use a service you haven't agreed to use. Ever used a windows computer at school that you don't own? Has Siri ever recorded your voice from *someone elses* iphone?"
"I just think too many people make excuses for big tech companies to do whatever they want without really thinking about how we could improve things, seeing as plenty of people disagree with the current way of things.I can see the benefits of strict data standards and regulation, I can also see how that could restrict the ability of these companies to create new and more powerful tools relying on your data (tools to benefit you, obviously there is the flip side to that as well)."
"Another way, is to promote the idea that we have the responsibility to be aware of how our data is being used.  No one reads the ToS is such a common excuse (I certainly don't read them).  But there is so much outrage every time one of these stories breaks, that maybe that shouldn't be an excuse anymore.  We have the all the power to inform ourselves, there are privacy policies, terms of service, privacy whitepapers, that are ignored everyday, why doesn't some of the responsibility fall on us?That's irrelevant. A third party is any party other than the original 2. Here it is you and Apple. Source: http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/third-party.htmlSouth Park nailed it. "

"The full section on Siri (page 40):"
"> By simply talking naturally, users can enlist Siri to send messages, schedule meetings, place phone calls, and more. Siri uses speech recognition, text-to-speech, and a client- server model to respond to a broad range of requests. The tasks that Siri supports have been designed to ensure that only the absolute minimal amount of personal information is utilized and that it is fully protected. "
"> When Siri is turned on, the device creates random identifiers for use with the voice recognition and Siri servers. These identifiers are used only within Siri and are utilized  to improve the service. If Siri is subsequently turned off, the device will generate a new random identifier to be used if Siri is turned back on. "
"> In order to facilitate Siri's features, some of the user's information from the device is sent to the server. This includes information about the music library (song titles, artists, and playlists), the names of Reminders lists, and names and relationships that are defined in Contacts. All communication with the server is over HTTPS. "
"> When a Siri session is initiated, the user's first and last name (from Contacts), along with a rough geographic location, is sent to the server. This is so Siri can respond with the name or answer questions that only need an approximate location, such as those about the weather. "
"> If a more precise location is necessary, for example, to determine the location of nearby movie theaters, the server asks the device to provide a more exact location. This is an example of how, by default, information is sent to the server only when it's strictly necessary to process the user's request. In any event, session information is discarded after 10 minutes of inactivity."
"> The recording of the user's spoken words is sent to Apple's voice recognition server. If the task involves dictation only, the recognized text is sent back to the device. Otherwise, Siri analyzes the text and, if necessary, combines it with information from the profile associated with the device. For example, if the request is send a message to my mom, the relationships and names that were uploaded from Contacts are utilized. The command for the identified action is then sent back to the device to be carried out. "
"> Many Siri functions are accomplished by the device under the direction of the server. For example, if the user asks Siri to read an incoming message, the server simply tells the device to speak the contents of its unread messages. The contents and sender of the message are not sent to the server. "
"> User voice recordings are saved for a six-month period so that the recognition system can utilize them to better understand the user's voice. After six months, another copy is saved, without its identifier, for use by Apple in improving and developing Siri for up to two years. Additionally, some recordings that reference music, sports teams and players, and businesses or points of interest are similarly saved for purposes of improving Siri. "
"> Siri can also be invoked hands-free via voice activation. The voice trigger detection is performed locally on the device. In this mode, Siri is activated only when the incoming audio pattern sufficiently matches the acoustics of the specified trigger phrase. When the trigger is detected, the corresponding audio including the subsequent Siri command is sent to Apple's voice recognition server for further processing, which follows the same rules as other user voice recordings made through Siri. I still don't want to read all that so I'll just assume you're correct.Thanks for letting us know.You're welcome.And where does that say that everything I said is going to be listened to by a minimum wage worker at a third party?Indeed, but many more people probably realize it now than before, since it's on the front page of Reddit.I must have missed the section that mentions everything you say to Siri will be sent to a minimum wage employee at a third party? Am I taking crazy pills? I just barely trust Apple with my private information - why would I trust third parties at all? I've been using iPhone since the 4 came out and I have a 6 now, I'm not an android guy, but you look like a ball-gargling fanboy when you dump this wall of text on us and fail to actually address the point - sharing with third parties. "
"And to everyone saying well of course they're using a third party, duh! - I say: it's not so of course if  not a single Apple privacy policy mentions it. Are they sharing every iCloud email I send to a third party? Is that obvious or not obvious? Stop being shills. You must have missed the part that is in bold in their ToS that says just that.  When a company mentions subsidiaries, agents or any other terms like that, it could be any company in the world for all we know. "
"Most of those relationships are not disclosed, for obvious reasons. I'm sorry where did it mention it in the giant wall of text up above?Those aren't terms of service, are they?  Maybe they should explain everything they do everywhere?Did you not read? The third parties aren't going to get your private information... they're just getting voice recordings.Their privacy policy is very clear about some information being sent to third parties.  You can find it on their website.  Under Disclosure to Third Parties"
">At times Apple may make certain personal information available to strategic partners that work with Apple to provide products and services, or that help Apple market to customers.Again, once you're done gargling balls, admit that the superfluous wall of text above us mentions nothing about sharing Siri voice data to third parties. Sorry, but people defending a completely common and obvious practice are not being shills. Google Now and Cortana and pretty much any device with voice controls and internet connectivity is sending your voice to third parties.I love how people how outraged by these things. There's countless items from popular services that are powered by 3rd parties in some way. Apple, Google and every other company in the work can't and wouldn't provide every single service. "
"Now, if your name and address was sent along with every audio clip, well then I'd understand the outrage, but surely it isn't. This needs to be higher. People cry Privacy invasion as soon as something leaves their device, but Siri can only improve and be useful if things do leave your device."
"And not all of Siri's technology is in-house. Of course 3rd parties are involved, just look at the licensing information on an iPhone. And yet this post rises to the top or /r/all as if Obama admitted to smoke pot."
"I'm convinced people just automatically upvote anything that even looks negative on Apple."
"Just after reading the title. Not reading the article, knowing the context, using their brain or anything. In my experience, reddit is heavily skewed towards android devices. Articles that do well tend to reinforce those views, but articles that do REALLY well tend to expose horrible injustices that apple / NSA / evilCorp do. You don't often see an anti android / google post hit the front page, though plenty do exist. And to be fair *Google's* business model *is* explicitly to collect data. Look at the top comment. Clearly didn't read the article and got up voted, probably by people who didn't read the article.This happens for a few weeks every time apple has a product launch. Hardly an article. More ads than content. To be fair, it says the data gets sent to Apple servers. It doesn't mention explicitly that they get sent to a third party as well.This is the same as the previous revelations that yes, voice recognition is handled by 3rd parties, and our devices do have to send the sound to them. This is a necessary step in the process, and this title is super sensationalist (though blame for that goes to the site being linked). "
"It shouldn't be surprising either that companies who handle voice recognition hire humans to check how good their system is at recognizing voices. How else would you propose they assure quality and try to improve? [deleted]in a world of contracts, not understanding the EULA and then complaining that their rights are gone is idiocy. I have no sympathy for those who are willfully ignorant of what they sign up for because they don't have time to read and understand what privacies they are giving up on by using x device or serviceI think it's unreasonable to expect everyone to have the right technical expertise and time to bury into this stuff. And companies know it. You're probably at an advantage for even knowing this kind of stuff goes on."
"Firefox make it nice and simple. When you install, they ask if you're happy with data collection to improve the browser. Microsoft ask before sending a crash report."
"If it were a person hiding stuff they know people would be unhappy about, you'd probably think they're a bit of a jerk. Companies can be jerks too.The problem us that a lot of these terms we agree on are written down in very lengthy texts that would take forever to read. People don't read them  because they assume that companies don't misuse their trust. If the terms were just writtwn is a way that made them easily readable, then I bet a lot more people would read them.  "
"Also, we live in a time where companies just shit all over people's rights without many of us even knowing it. There need to be some change so that the default settings are never set to abuse private information, like they are today.There was a study of some validity that said it would take 250 hours to read all of our EULAs. Longer for people with a non-legal background (although you would probably get a lot better after the first 100 hrs)."

"Just because we are ignorant of it, it does not mean it would never affect us. That's not hidden at all. There is a concise dialogue telling you exactly what happens when you activate Siri. You have to be in full ignorance mode to not become aware of this.Found the guy that thinks AI is easy.He didn't say it was easy, he said you could set up a programme that tested it internally, rather than using unknowing members of the public."
"In what way does hiring someone to test the device (or rather, forming some voluntary opt-in programme) suddenly make it easy to design the AI?Pffft. It's just a bunch of else or if statements anyway."
"Afternoon job at most, I'd say!Unit testing. I know. This is the most mild invasion of privacy I've ever experienced. Someone heard me ask Siri if the micro machines guy was still alive! Oh no! This isn't the same as the NSA listening to conversations at all. It's more like someone reading my anonymous google search terms, and google search data is public.> How else would you propose they assure quality and try to improve? "
"Two ways:"
"1. When user corrects themselves manually (via keyboard) - send which word was corrected as a learning process. On most occasions I'd assume changing word after voice to text transcription means voice recognition failed partially."
"2. For situations where input field is not present, give frown icon (or text Report voice recognition or whatever). Create an interface that allows user to report specifics of what went wrong in a pre-defined way (so that no human has to process the report) - for example pick word and suggest different word similar to web UI for Google Translator.Haha now you're making users do work. That's one way to piss them off, and a good one, too."
"No, let's not do any of that. User has to correct wrong words anyway. Second point can be done nicely so that user is happy enough to help. I don't quite get your point... In both of the situations that you mentioned someone would still need to actually review  your recording to make sure you arent fucking with the system or to make sure that YOU are actually saying the appropriate word.The sheer amount of users solves anybody trying to mess with the system."
"It's nothing new. Those swipe or other predictive keyboards learn same way. >sheer amount of users solves"
"e.g. Reverse The Odds is a puzzle adventure game and Android and iOS app that crows-sources data for Cancer Research."

I don't know how, but I hear they're imbued with magical powers.YEAH, MAGNETS, BITCH!To many people their phone is a magic box. The revelation that someone out there has to decipher what they say and interacts with their privacy destroys that illusion. Why is it a third party? Why is Apple not hiring people to assure quality of their product?Because Apple don't make the software or run the systems.  There's widespread speculation that Siri voice recognition is handled by the same company that does the VR from Samsung's smart TV.Nuance is behind the Siri voice recognition.They did hire people. They hired a third party.I prefer the third party setup simply because of how the trust is set up. We trust Apple with our voice data (ie. to aggregate a random sample of it into generic statistical groups) Apple trusts the third party with statistical data. If we were simply trusting Apple with the data and we were trusting them alone there is no motivation for Apple to aggregate the data for analysis in such a way to make the data anonymous, in fact that would arguably reduce the efficacy of analysis since you have less data to analyze.Apple doesn't own the speech recognition technology. The voice data is sent to Nuance (leader in voice recognition). Nuance processes the voice and reviews samples for adaptation or learning to improve the system."
"Source: I am a trained speech recognition analyst for medical speech recognition and support different speech recognition solutions like Dragon Medical and SayIt from NVOQ.

"It's a cool tech but beware everything you say is recorded and can be stored forever.Anything + Apple = Pageviews I am so fucking sick of these headlines. No shit Sherlock, what the hell did you think they were doing? Are people simply stupid to not know how this works? Stop being surprised for a change. Nobody cares to explain these things properly, and it's making me go mad.Pretty much every sensationalist story about Apple is bullshit these days, but /r/technology can never figure it out on their own before the hate sheep hammer the button.> How else would you propose they assure quality and try to improve? "
"One approach would be to have people who want to help opt-in, like other software publishers do it too."
"Do you want to help improve Siri by sending your voice data to third parties? [yes/ no]"
"Most people would click no, but the remaining 1% or whichever could be more than enough to get a statistical sample."
"Naturally, such questions aren't free of usability problems -- [every time you ask the user something, you're forcing them to make a choice](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/uibook/chapters/fog0000000059.html)."
"I don't think we should have an of course there's no privacy in the cloud and users are stupid approach. Of course there's no safety in restaurants and obviously everyone could stab each other with a knife. We should:"
"- help explain to non-tech people that there's much less privacy in the cloud, and that everything they say may be recorded"
"- try push companies to transparent, possibly audited processes to guarantee as much privacy as possible"
"- maybe we need some of those shock graphics like on cigarette packs... this time, some NSA dude laughing at your nude pics>How else would you propose they assure quality and try to improve?"
"Obviously just write an algorithm to confirm that the other algorithm can properly decode voices. Duh. Actually those algorithms work by learning from examples, humans are necessary to produce those examples. We also play a critical role in identifying where an algorithm is messing up so it can be refined.  Source: I am a Data Scientist at IBM. Or, they just run their own internal/beta testing programme, so that the people sending their data in are fully aware of where it's being sent.I want to say that to use Siri you have to agree to let Apple send it outside for quality assurance."
"One of the reasons you don't want to rely solely on in-house beta: [HP sold a webcam in 2009 that couldn't see track black people](http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/12/22/hp.webcams/). The best way to test your product is see if it will work with your users is to test it on your users.Keep in mind they are approaching 1,000,000,000 iPhone in the market...  across many languages and accents. Imagine trying to do an in house beta!Yeah, that's a fair point."
"Still, though, no reason why you couldn't give people a $5 voucher in the app store, it wouldn't be difficult to recruit millions of people to opt in.Hey listen what this asshole dictated about his girlfriend. Let's upload it to YouTube![deleted]Yeah, you're actually right about that.  They're almost completely skint: http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/02/apple-cash-mountain-growsApple has $180 billion dollars *in cash*."
"They could afford to give everyone in the whole world $25.Time to enlist people with ResearchKit! aren't there 8 times as many android devices?  how does google improve their voice recognition?  (i imagine with the same strategy)Based on browsing stats of ios vs android, the bazillion extra android users don't seem to actually use their devices.  Are we sure google absolutely does not use 3rd party services?The Google approach?I had a job for google doing quality checks for ad words, to make sure the ad was suited to the query."
"EDIT: it was pretty dull, there's a query (you only see what the search term is) and then an ad appears, you have to make sure it's relevant to the search and the website is decent. I assume it was all based from people's search history or something but the terms were usually relevant and never gave anything away or had personal details attached.It's algorithms all the way down.Cupcakes and strippersCupcakes and Lollipops.After reading the article, I asked Siri to lick my butthole several times.Follow it up with a 'thank you'.when will people realise that everything you do on smartphones or practically any web device is simply not private. and let's face it, something like siri simply has to be monitored if only for the betterment of its accuracy and comprehension, marketing aspects of that information aside.That's not the case with android.I'll take your word on that (only ever fully read an EULA once, and that was some time ago) and long may it continue if that's the case but there's nothing stopping them from changing thier policies in the future much how Facebook did (with all the repercussions that came with it) and if no-one does read it and just accepts that android is always on their side then we as consumers might get caught out one day."
"my personal policy has always been, any 3rd party service I use, my data most likely will not be private. any content I create on or using said service, I will most likely not have any legal right over. "
"I don't really have any problems after accepting that.Apple, Google, Microsoft, etc. go check their privacy policies, they are very clear about what they are doing.  Being comfortable or uncomfortable about it is fine, but simply claiming that it's not happening is ridiculous.That is very much the case with android. In he same thread where the guy told about listening to Siri he said he also had listened to Cortana and Now. Besides, information is stored on american servers. That information will be given to a bunch of agencies as soon as they mention it. Your information is not your own, and it is definitely not private.[deleted][deleted]Well then I assume you either aren't high up enough, or you're breaking a NDA by spilling some beans.And how exactly would you be able to see the flickering of a light when most videos are still lower in a framerate than the electrical grid hertz?

"It's called deflection. This thread is about Apple."
"(I use this comment so many times, I just cut and paste it anymore.)doesn't make it less relevant to the conversation. I mean shit, if we stayed specific to apple with our responses then all this thread could ever be is oh no, apple are sharing data with 3rd parties that users somehow believed was private data even though in the EULA it clearly states that it will be shared, the users simply didn't give a shit enough to read it and now some article is talking about it like its a big deal. Really, the way any service is set up means you have no privacy. And the fourth amendment and subsequent changes to it (Reasonable expectation of privacy) only go so far to protect it. "
"It is actually very unreasonable to expect your email, searches, etc. to be considered private when you are sending so much information to second and third parties. "
"One of two things needs to happen to ensure privacy for people"
"The first is that there is significant legal change designed to protect your privacy online, the issue is that this runs into conflicts in many areas, and would be a kind of protect us from ourselves measure which is not really what is often done."
"The second is that people start independently taking measures to better secure their information, encryption and the like. To which I say lmfao yeh ok.I use Android with XPrivacy. Apps don't have permission to get my information. It has randomized data too for the hell of it.power to you!Agree.   But my issue is that Tim Cook acts like Apple is Holier-than-thou on privacy.   That's because this title is clickbait bullshit. Apple's security white paper shows how transparent they are. You people will upvote anything remotely anti-Apple."
"http://redd.it/2yvjf5Which they are, somewhat. He doesn't claim that Siri data isn't analyzed by humans, though.What evidence do we have that Apple is Holier-than-thou on privacy?    Because they say they are?   Honestly, I trust Google more than Apple.   I feel Google knows security far better than Apple.   And why is that? Because Apple is for the newbz who don't know better. Use superior gear like the far more intelligent being that I am? m'lady."
"It's simple. Follow the money. Google makes the vast majority of money from collecting information and selling ads. Apple makes the majority from hardware sales, everything else like cloud is just to increase the value of the hardware they sell. They have no incentive to fuck with that and ire customers.yeah that kind of jackassery is just lowThey are pretty good. Unlike Google, they don't sell the information to third parties for marketing purposes. They also provide everyone encryption that is so well-implemented that it frustrates law enforcement. Apple does behave in a privacy-sensitive way. It's just that the climate being what it is, especially in tech, them doing better than the other guys is not that meaningful at least for a security researcher who would really prefer everything be perfect.I don't believe Google has ever sold information to third parties.   Maybe I am wrong but I spend a lot of time reading, surfing and have not heard this from a reliable source. "
"Could you provide a source?"
"On encryption it was Google that elevated sites in search that use SSL.   There are other examples where Google  has pushed encryption.   So not exactly sure where you are going there."
"BTW, with the new service workers it has been Google that has required SSL.   Will not allow otherwise.  > I don't believe Google has ever sold information to third parties."
"Er, it's literally their business model. We're being butthurt about anonymized data being used for purposes outside of the intended purpose of providing that data? In Google's case, making a search query or receiving an email. In Siri's case, making a vocal search query. You get my point. These all use your data for a secondary function - improving targeted marketing, improving voice recognition software, yada yada - potentially by a third party. "
"And that's literally Google's business model. They collect a lot of data and use it in ways that don't fulfil the original goal of what you provided it for. "
"I don't think that's a huge issue, but some do.Ok, if it is their business model then I would think it would be easy to find a source.   I have searched both Google and then tried Bing.   "
"In neither place can I find an example of Google selling personal data to any company.   Zero.   I do find tons of examples of people saying this on sites like Reddit.   But zero examples of it actually happening."
"I find this very frustrating that people say something that apparently is not true over and over again.   Then people repeat it like it is true."
"Does it bother you to repeat something that there is no source of being true?Because it's so blatantly obvious. "
"Example: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Flu_Trends"
"Google Flu Trends aggregates searches (*your personal data*) for analysis by Google. Through other programs, this analysis is conducted by third parties."
"It's not like there's a file with your name on it in Silicon Valley. That's not what anyone's alleging. But when you make a search, Google and Apple see the content of that search and are able to sell the content in aggregate for analysis by Search Engine Optimization companies/people doing analytics work/etc. "
"Edit: for people downvoting, please explain.I honestly want to see how this works.    My wife is a big Google user.   Can you show me how can I download her personal information from Google for a fee?"
"There are interesting sites on the Internet where I can find all kinds of info about someone for a fee.   But I don't believe any of these are available from Google.   Where is this type of service from Google?"
"Your link above is not personal data but aggregated search data.   Very different from personal information. Google does not sell any information to third parties. If they did, their model would quickly break down. If advertisers had all their targeting data, they wouldn't need to go back to Google. What Google does sell is a service to advertisers where they will serve the ads to the target demographic. The difference is, one trusted company having data, and using it in ways that are clearly defined in their (plain English) privacy policy, and who knows how many companies having your data and using it for who knows what.They don't sell it, they sell the result of it."
"Pay us x dollars for targeting young males in Ontario between the ages if 18-24 is not the same as Pay us x dollars and we will give you Nupogodi's digits."
"Ya see?Actually, they do have a pretty good track record as far as privacy goes.I don't mean to be combative but what do you base this on?[deleted]http://redd.it/2yvjf5"
"Here you go.That's a weird expectation.  There's a lot of successful companies that aren't very transparent.  Granted, most of them don't handle as much personal knowledge of us, but still it's not like it's outside the norm.They can't link what you say or do on Siri to you.  It's all done by random identifiers that change often.  It seems like this is less of a privacy thing, and more of a way of attempting to improve Siri.I think that's called trying to sell a brand."
"A dont-give-a-fuck-about-privacy attitude probably won't sell more iPhones.Can you provide some examples?Well... yeah, no shit sherlock. This was verified a bunch of times when you activated it and was well publicized for almost all the voice-recognition services like Google, Samsung, Microsoft etc."
"As long as it's anonymized beforehand and not tied into user info, I honestly can't care less. This is what I thought the problem was about.  If everything is anonymous does it matter?  Also can they find out who the person was after the fact?  If they can that's kinda of fucked up.No. It's completely disconnected and anonymized. The necessary sample sizes are enormous. People think you make this talk to a computer thing work with magic....Okay, so what is it we're upset about with this? Yes, it says right there when you agree to allow it. It's going to be heard by someone else for the sake of what amounts to an audio captcha. Do your words match what Siri put in? I don't get what the problem is here. Anyone care to explain?There is no problem. The problem is that /r/technology is slowly being overrun by conspiracy theorists and other tinfoil enthusiasts. Was there ever any doubt? No; it says so in the terms of use.I'm sure Google is doing more and worse, yet no one care. Color me shocked.The joke's on you: the only questions in ask Siri are sexual.Now I regret asking it the best places to hide a body...Shit post, OP. Apple didn't admit anything, unless you mean in its terms and conditions, in which case it isn't news."
"Also, your article uses *another redditor* as its primary source, not Apple.I hate Apple as much as the next guy, but that's literally the only way to improve voice command programs."
"I'm 99% sure that every single thing that is voice-activated and connected to the internet sends the audio to some other company for analysis."
"That's the only way you can find out if you're picking up what people are saying correctly, by having an actual person listen to the words, read the text that was interpreted, and then say good or bad.I have done work on Amazon Mechanical Turk where I had to check transcriptions from voice commands for cell phones. Specifically Samsung Galaxy phones, but I imagine Siri was in there somewhere as well.From the article: "
"Apple's iOS Software License Agreement also clearly states that, By using Siri or Dictation, you agree and consent to Apple's and its subsidiaries' and agents' transmission, collection, maintenance, processing, and use of this information, including your voice input and User Data, to provide and improve Siri, Dictation, and dictation functionality in other Apple products and services."
"What's the controversy that the title is trying to suggest?"
"Am I the only one thinking that the violation of a NDA - by who posted on Reddit about his/her Siri reviewing job - is much worse?Yes?"
"I actually didn't know ~~it~~ *voice data* was being shared with 3rd parties. I fully expected Apple to use it internally (like Google I presume), not contract it out."
"EDIT: by it, above, I'm referring to **voice data**, not the transcribed query. Of course Apple uses third party APIs using information obtained from your query, that's hardly surprising. What wasn't obvious to me is that **voice data** is also being shared to third parties.So what you're saying is you expect things contrary to the user agreement you elected not to read before agreeing to? Apple has recently made a strong push in marketing themselves as the more-private alternative.  Tim Cook [posted this](https://www.apple.com/privacy/):"
">We believe in telling you up front exactly what's going to happen to your personal information and asking for your permission before you share it with us. And if you change your mind later, we make it easy to stop sharing with us. "
"I'm not an iOS user but this would be a compelling reason to switch.  How up front is Siri regarding sending data and is the Siri function opt-in or opt-out on a new device?"
"You can't even use voice dictation for text input from the keyboard without agreeing to a pop-up which informs you that your voice will be sent to Apple, with a button included in case you'd like to learn more. The same message is in preferences if you'd like to turn on siri."
"My understanding is that technically ALL of the voice data goes to Apple, to their servers for the processing. And the message is upfront about that."
"Sending to 3rd parties sounds scarier without knowing more about it. They probably should mention that more clearly but I don't think they're engaging in any insecure practice. Random anonymous clips of voice data are sent out to improve accuracy. Big deal.Google is using your data with third parties in the same way Siri does. Seriously read what Apple is actually admitting here. "
"If you ask Google Now about the weather Google passes that request to Weather Underground, Inc."
"Just like when you ask Siri for restaurants nearby it passes that request to Yelp. "
"Seriously what's the problem here? I was hoping /r/technology had a better understanding on how these services work. This is getting ridiculous. Google uses it internally and contracts it out just like Apple. Do you have a source that corroborates your claim? AFAIK Google doesn't share your **voice data** (which is what I found surprising). Yeah... but Google!!duh..."
"seriously, how do you people not know this already? so does samsung TVs, google, and anything else that interacts with your voice + internet"
"it's called [Machine Learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) and requires collected data to become more accurate"
"that's why when people said i'm never buying a samsung TV because of this, I just called them an idiot because they probably own an android or iphoneNot to defend Apple, but where in that article did Apple admit anything? Looks like this unknown publication took the Reddit guy at his word, wrote an article and then decided to look through the SLA to find that part. "
"Again, who was the spokes-person that admitted this to the reporter of this story? Where is this story on Ars, or Verge, or CNET? I mean, wouldn't this be a HUGE story?While I love a good old fashioned Apple bashing circle jerk.  It annoys me when people think that everything they do is private.  Every time you go to the grocery store, best buy, gamestop and use an account to get the discounts they are building a profile on you.  And profiles on everyone else that shops there.  Same thing goes with this kind of tech.  "
"They are trying to tailor their product for the consumer.  grocery stores are finding out what products are best to keep on hand, and what coupons to send you to come back.  Amazon.com recommends products that are similar to what you bought/looked at earlier."
"It amazes me how people who have no idea about computer programming pretend that something can be so easy.  I know too many people that try to interject a Well they should just program something to do that for them.  Hey if it was that fucking easy you would program your own cell phone and not be using Apple's.Problem with this argument....."
"When you go to a store, you need to sign up for those customer loyalty programs.  In exchange for selling your info, you get a discount."
"With apple, I've purchased the phone in exchange for money.  The business transaction is concluded at that point.  What apple is doing is re-monetizing a completed transaction when the other side isnt deriving any benefit from - which is why its wrongBut you are deriving benefit from it. Apple is using it to improve its voice recognition quality.You're benefitting by using siri. Except that part where you agreed to their terms and conditions.>Problem with this argument....."
"You then go on to make an incorrect analogy. Good try. Someone doesnt know what the word analogy means.....when exactly did literacy become a lost art?You don't have a clue what you're talking about because those two things aren't even remotely the same.Then don't use Siri. Don't use dictation. Don't agree to the terms that they clearly state for using these services. "
"Your analogy only works if, upon walking into the store, you're demanded to either make a store account or leave. That isn't what's happening here. An iPhone is perfectly usable (Android fans will disagree) without the voice commands and dictation. But this means you've bought something that you cant use, as you bought the phone, the o/s, etc"
"For your argument to be valid, siri would not have come preinstalled on the phone.  Only if a user installing it post purchase and entering a new agreement would your argument be true.  While Siri is included and part of the cost of the phone, it's not enabled without manually turning it on, on a screen which notifies you that your voice recordings and other data will be sent to Apple."
"Others have already stated that Apple is not selling your information or building a profile on you. They're simply figuring out how to improve their algorithms to understand speech."
"Also, stores often track customers through credit cards, without any signup required. When you buy a banana at Target one day and a TV the next, using the same credit card, Target knows that the same customer bought those items, the day/times, they bought them, how much they paid, etc. This is tracked and used in the same way as what has already been mentioned with customer loyalty programs. A couple of things here....."
"> t's not enabled without manually turning it on, on a screen which notifies you that your voice recordings and other data will be sent to Apple."
"What you are saying is that you are being charged for software that has been disabled and yet.....you're okay with this?"
"Secondly, while the article mentions that one of the third partie**S** is using that info to make siri better, how do you think this is funded?  From the cost of the phone - maybe but handsets are already discounted.  More than likely, its from selling that information to the other parties not mentioned - remember - its plural."
"Thirdly, in regards to credit cards, yes, the store can retain this information, but there is the option of paying with cash, and most consumers will pay with cash only.  Furthermore, this information is quite shallow - in that it doesnt know your age/gender/where you go after you leave the store, etc."
"Yes, I'm fine with it. I'm also paying for the front facing camera which I never use. I realize that the cost of it is negligible and lots of other people do want it on their phone."
"Yes, it's clearly funded by the cost of the phone and maybe future benefits of having better voice recognition. iPhones are not subsidized by Apple, they make a very healthy profit on them. They are often subsidized by the carriers who mostly remake that money through monthly service  fees and have nothing to do with this.You can use the phone without Siri. You don't have to use either Siri or dictation in order for your phone to function. I never use dictation and only use Siri when I want to google something that isn't hard for it to understand, as well as set a timer. But I can do those things easily without using Siri. So if you don't want to use Siri or dictation, it's very easy to avoid them. Step 1:  Read what I said"
"Step 2:  Notice where I say siri was sold with the phone - by default, this means you've already paid for siri and all rights associated for fair usage of said product"
"Step 3:  explain how apple can charge the customer twice - once when they purchased siri, and twice when they sell the information from the usage of siri"
"Yeah, I don't have patience for this right now. Okay, believe what you want. Apple is a big bad company who wants to give all your deepest darkest google searches to shady companies while taking it in the ass from the NSA. Sound good? It's not being monetized. Apple buys a service to check pronunciation for Siri. Please reread article - states clearly multiple parties involved - only one party was mentioned.> Walk N' Talk Technologies and other similar companies work with Apple and Microsoft to help them improve the accuracy of their intelligent personal assistant applications, Siri, Dictation and Cortana."
"Not only that but the article is extremely poor quality and only cites a reddit post made two weeks ago on this very subreddit. The title itself should be enough to turn you away as Apple has been freely acknowledging for a long time that siri's data is used by 3rd parties to enhance siri's accuracy. [deleted]I'm sorry, what part of this system are they monetising?Misleading news article title. Apple is not sharing your voice data with third parties for a profit. They are contracting third parties to listen to your voice data in an effort to make voice recognition better. Google is doing it too. You agreed to let them do this when you agreed to their legal waivers. The third party companies do not have any way to tie it back to you, they're just listening in to what you say and noting when the software gets things wrong so that engineers know what needs to be improved.Lawyer here:"
"I'm not convinced that agreeing to allow your voice data to be transmitted to to Apple's subsidiaries and agents encompasses third parties. Agent and subsidiary are both legal terms of art. Apple also used the phrase third-parties elsewhere in the TOS, which suggests a distinction in meaning. "
"That said, this article is pretty terrible. Where does Apple admit anything? They talk about the reddit thread, and the TOS, but there's no new information. Did I miss something?I really don't understand the issue here.  The way this technology works REQUIRES them to send your voice recording to a server."
"Your phone does not have the capability of recognizing and transcribing your voice, that all happens on a server farm."
"Apple didn't create Siri, they bought it and it's based on yet another company's back end technology.  It's a collaboration."
"I don't care if people listen to what I say into a speech recognition system as long as it's anonymized.  I don't even care if they save it for all eternity, though I can't imagine anyone would...that's just a huge waste of disk space.Admits? It tells you up front.I hope some poor schmuck listens to my conversations with Siri. It's 85%  Siri go fuck yourself you fucking cunt because it's incapable of going what I want. Also, Siri, why are you such a twat?We need a misleading title tag.Well, third parties know that I have anger problems when I'm misunderstood, I guess. Who is honestly surprised by this 'reveal' of information.Why is there never an outcry about Amazon Echo?I would't have a problem with  them improving my SiriAny1 here surprised? No.Fuck Apple, fuck them all."
"*When is the next Apple product coming out? Can't wait to get it!!!!!*Oh good. Now 3rd parties will know I set timers with Siri to remind me to turn off my pool topoff water."
"I for one am extremely surprised at this news "
"-No oneReally? Apple sharing private data? Big surprise...we should curse at Siri more often.South Park seems to have called this shit.Siri *is* a third party. The voice recognition is completely 3rd party technology. They were open about this and it should come at no surprise to the informed.I've never had an iPhone but have an iPad. I think I tried siri a couple of times. Each time she said she had to look it up on the internet. Hell, I can do that. I haven't used siri since."
"Frankly - I find her annoying.It would seem that very few people understand the concept of cloud based services. "
"They aren't 'sharing' or 'violating your privacy' or anything like that. The Siri service collects the audio request, the audio is streamed to a cloud based Speech Rec and Natural Language Understanding service that is provided by a third party, widely believe to be Nuance in this case. The third party parses the audio, turns it into text (based upon these two cloud based functions) and returns the output to the Siri service, which shows it on your screen. "
"That's all."
"There's nothing sinister at play here. The same type of cloud based transactions are occurring ALL THE TIME with so many other services that you consume every day. People need to wake the fuck up and realize that every piece of information they offer to a corporation is being sold to many, many third parties."
"Goddamn sheep.45 year old software engineer here. If you kids think your data is safe or have any expectation of privacy, you are idiots. You give up privacy dozens of ways. Every time you buy anything anywhere. "
"Soon you whippersnappers post a TIL companies track my every move in covert ways. Shit, that's been true since even before the invention of the computer. Knowing what consumers want and care about is not just useful to marketers, it's useful to governments. You most likely don't want to admit it, but we all indirectly benefit from this data - Better products, a pizza place (that you like) closer to your house, etc. "
"If you want privacy get off the grid, get a cabin in the woods running on solar power, pay cash for everything and get rid of all electronic devices and identification (you know they have NFC in those, right?)."
"Stop getting your panties in a twist over nothing. Google, Mocrosoft and literally every company (with the resources) does this. You at live in a modern world, not the fucking 1800's."
"[deleted]I'm not saying there is any guaranteed benefit. I'm not even saying that I like it either. I'm just saying your data has and will be bought and sold of you like it or not. If you don't like it, become an activist - but if your expectation is that you will only buy games or software that doesn't spy on you, you're going to have a very tough time with that. Come to terms with the reality of the modern world, fight it, or become a Luddite. Or you can bitch about it but not really do anything about it, which is pretty much what everyone does.They need to let us opt out of this. I don't know if it's still true, but google voice had/has a feature on voicemails asking if you want to submit them to help make the program better.No need to opt out. Just stop using it."
"The data has to be sent to Apple to be processed and to give you an answer. Randomized samples of data have to be reviewed by humans to improve the accuracy and to check things are working as expected. It's not unusual to farm this kind of work out to third-party companies in countries like the Philippines or India. "
"This isn't a big secret. It's just a sensationalised story to grab the attention of those who don't understand technology."
"It's not like they're selling your voice recordings to be used in jerk-off booths. I hope they enjoy my constant requests to set 14 minute timers for pizza cause that's all I ever use it for. Is anyone surprised?By looking at the comments, this isn't a new thing in the least. It's been stated in multiple other places. The issue I have with this is the confusion of agreement forms. The average consumer will not read the full document and even if they do it won't be fully understood because of vague statements. These things really need a TL; DR form for the consumer (that is not misleading)Is anyone surprised by this? All your personal data is for sale. Always.Jokes on you, I'm too poor for Apple products!I use iPhone because Google steals all your data. "
"Well, there goes that fanboy argument. Why would anyone expect differently at this point? I just assume that Costco, ClearChannel, IBM, Wal-Mart, all of them, have a dense profile on me and my interests and have decided whether or not I'm a viable target for their marketing. The don't give your voice away with your name attached, this is done for quality control reasons to ensure that their system is doing what it is supposed to.Just to make sure I understand it right, basically someone in an office somewhere listens to an audio clip and has the text for what siri et al thought you said and reports on how accurate it was? Yes.  Everyone's trying to blow this thing out of proportion though.Looks like it's time to ask Siri some fucked up shit!!So what is the significance of my children asking how much could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? Based on my house, third parties are going to think wood chucks are of extreme impotence.Pretty sure most woodchuck can get wood.It's a good thing all I use Siri for is asking it do math for me (it can eve do basic calculus!) because I'm too lazy to type it in wolfram. No secrets of mine for you Siri!So, what we can learn from this thread is that we don't have the tech to use computers to decipher what is being asked to siri and how to Interpet the question. Still need humans to do that by listening and interpreting correctly. No. It's probably human assisted learning, where humans correct Siri's automatic interpretations to make it better.I really dont get it.. Either it was in the TOS and they have really nothing to admit to or it wasnt and they will go to court. Which was it?You're not the product, you're the customer - Tim CookI wonder how much revenue these companies generate from selling this data to marketers? You thought the drop in technology prices was a result of economies of scale and cheaper parts? Nope. They all decided to integrate voice and sell your private information.Is there any private information here though? What are marketers going to do with a clip of me yelling SIRI, PLAY OL DERTY BASS TURD!Is anyone really surprised, like really?Just as well I don't use Siri because it's shit if you're anywhere outside the USA. My God, it would be so boring to listen to all that. Reminds me of a youtube video I watched about God listening to his voicemail and it was just people thanking him for dinner over and over and he cut it off...quite amusing actually. i asked some really fucked up things in the hope that this was actually a thing, i'm glad this paid off. This makes me feel better about all the times I've called her a cum gargling gutter whore.Bah, I don't care.  Whatever gets me my tricorder."
"Does this really matter though? I mean, I'm not telling Siri my secrets...... ^^^YetAbout all she gets out of me is What movies are playing, dial [contact] and I'll look up a restaurant if I'm calling in an order.Ask Siri why are fire trucks are red?This is really funny, I have a good friend who is an engineer and In my phone he is under the name Tony Stark. My cousin is in my phone as Bruce Wayne and my brother is in my phone as Captain America. The only time I use siri is to have her call them for me just so I can hear her darling robo voice say Calling Tony Stark  If your talk to a phone there is always a third party in the other side.All they're going to hear from my iPod is me, asking for a weather report, requesting Cure songs and teaching Siri to refer to me as Big Daddy.I don't care as long as it isn't tied to my device. If they are using this stuff anonymously to improve its performance, that makes sense. How else do you improve it?Come on. Is anyone really suprised by this?People use Siri?... That shit doesn't even workOdds the NSA has a deal with apple to turn the mic on whenever they want without warrant?Apple has such a large and loyal customer base but lets be honest they are really going downhill with everything over the past couple of years.Honestly I'm not really sure why everyone Is surprised. It's amazing how many people in this world are willfully ignorant, this is common knowledge in 2015.Isn't this how it functions? I didn't think Apple was the one translating itThey licensed technology from Nuance but they run it on their own servers. What they're doing here is outsourcing corrections to old voice recordings to improve voice recognition. (not really controversy worthy, it was already known they keep the recordings for 2 years. Just people bitching that it leaves Apple)Sick fucks, can't sell a damn thing that doesn't listen to me, apple watch is probably a recorder tooWhat is with Apple--and ANY other company--that does this sort of thing. I now realise that Apple is as untrustworthy as any other company that has been eavesdropping on my private life, that is none of their business. They are as untrustworthy as the US government, and all others, that engage in this sort of dishonesty. Get effed, Apple!!! I, for one, will never buy another of your products. You've lost our trust, and can never regain it!!!Thanks Captain.I am not surprised at all they sold user data. Every company will sell your data (regardless of what they say) for a price!No fucking shit. Apple doesn't have to admit this. Any sane person already knows.[Siri, where can I hide a body?](http://terrywhite.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_9077.jpg)Didn't we already know this? Why do we need their admittance?Omg, I wonder what the third parties will make out of Bazillions of Therabyte of Siri Fuck you and Where I can find hookers nearby..."
"The new Hello Barbie due out this Xmas is a Siri doll. I have to wonder if the kid goes to bed and Barbie is laying on the floor and Mon & Dad are having a conversation, will Barbie be sending that conversation to a 3rd party? Kinda creepy to think about.The real entertainment is that people actually are making this a headline.... Seriously, at which moment in time people actually understand that Apple is doing anything to generate money, and that is the only mission the company has.....Apple share data? Naaaaaaaaawwwwww they're too perfect."
"I don't like the company a bit.Your voice will be used by these third party companies to create advertisements, by you, for you, direct to your watch. Embrace your corporate overlords!What a dilemma for people, their interest in personal information privacy, challenged by their blind love for the company that makes their favourite shine toys. "
"Who will win! They could have just asked Siri Are you sharing my voice data with third parties?Oh great. iOS 9 is going to have yet another screen asking for permission to improve something or other before you can use your device. Pretty soon the setup process is just going to be Apple slowly reading the EULA to you and giving you a test to make sure you listened.wonder how much money someone paid to hear me say set alarm 6am no, set alarm 6am SET ALARM SIX A-M every evening.. before doing it myself.Who didn't think this was already the case?. Its probably in the terms of service. Someone uses Siri? I found it to be pretty much useless.Those poor third parties listening to me say nearby groceries a thousand times. wow i can't believe it. i'm so concernedJoke's on them - the only thing I use Siri voice search for is easter eggs and jokes that Siri may be programmed with."
"If a third party is reviewing, they're getting a lot of Monty Python quotes.And the crowd goes mildI will now start directing the barrage of insults normally reserved for Siri towards the people who listen to what I say. "
"Cortana is shared also.So, when my wife is away on a business trip and I tell her I want to lick her pussy this woman is listening?  nice...  Having a 3 way and didn't even know.  I will try to keep that in mind next time I ask her to fuck my face.No surprise hereJohn: Siri please lick my butthole."
"Siri: John I have send the information to a friend of mine who will validate if this is possible. Also the basis for a recent episode of Person Of Interest.Just a random thought... But if they have access to the recordings of our voice, can this somehow be used as an identifier? Wouldn't it be possible to use a method like this for criminal conviction or anything like that?The voice is listened to and the listener informs apple if a mistake was made. But the user data is completely removed - it's not breaking any laws, and it's still protecting your privacy. I asked Siri:"
"Me: Are you sharing this voice data with a third party?"
"Siri: No comment, [myname]i need to stop asking her who has the biggest weenie in hollywood.Those dirty mother fuckers!Good thing I haven't used Siri once on my iPhone.But more importantly, is My Talking Tom's voice data being shared with third parties? I thought it was already knowledge that they listen to everything said to Siri..  Why? She can't even understand me when I try to order a fucking pizza. Now everyone knows i ask siri what the weather is.... dammit </sarcasm>Siri, do you have a vagina? "
"*receives email from PornHub.*How else would you get results without third parties?People are hearing swear at Siri a lot when she doesn't understand what I say then...I... don't really care. Siri is a clunky piece of shit that I never use anyway. And certainly my phone is sharing other information of mine, in other ways. If they want my Candy Crush high scores so badly, they can have them. I'm not that interesting.I'm sure I read that they do this in their T&Cs. Mayyyyybe I should stop asking Siri to call my dealer for me...Can you expect any kind of privacy anymore? Should we just expect that by hitting the agree button we just forfeit everything?Great, now they know where my favorite sushi place is. It will take forever to get a seat now!>I heard everything from kiddos asking innocent things like 'Siri, do you like me?' to **some guy asking Galaxy to lick his butthole.** I wish I was kidding, she disclosed."
"Dear god...I feel so sorry for them to listen to this type of shit....literally...Frankly, this isn't surprising.  I suppose companies do everything they can to make a dime these days.  Android tracks your travel, google tracks your web history.  There's an industry dependent on collecting said information."
"I can see why people from other countries hate us, because everything is for sale.Which surprises anyone why?Well that's boring. All they're going to hear from me is."
"Set my alarm for 7am"
"Set my alarm for 5 minutes"
"Set my alarm for 10 minutesWho the fuck caresIt's not like we didn't know, they just confirmed it.They're going to hear a lot of set a X minute timer and set an alarm for X:XX tomorrow from me."
"Bastards are going to know when I get up and how I like my eggs, dammit!How is this a surprise to anyone?  We're talking Apple here.  Enjoy the service, but it's like getting a BJ from a meth addict, it's going to come with negative aftereffects. My god, does no one know how wolfram alpha works?Scary but necessary."
"I for one would love flawless speech-text."
"Android shares it too, through Nuance. It specifically spells it out when you attempt to use your Voice Recorder app on the memo function that Nuance collects voice data, sends and stores it on a server, and will do so until they are done with it. Oh, and that they'll be sharing it with any other company who wants (pays for) it enough.siri is a snitch.  fuuuuck.Ill show them! "
"Siri, show me a picture of dickbutt "
"I'm gonna ask so many times, somebody somewhere will ask themselves what the fuck I'm doing. One way or another...wtf. didn't apple always say they care about their customers' privacy and shit? wtf man.And the skies are blue etc.What!? I am outraged![deleted]I for one welcome our ~~Apple~~ **3rd Party** overlords.I like how this is posted nowhere in the /r/apple subreddit. Those guys are in such denial that anything is compromised on their devices Galaxy... lick my butthole. Who cares.Is this surprising? Are we surprised about this?"
"I'm not joking, from the get go, I always assumed people realized that apple would be sharing your Siri conversations with third parties, the same way Facebook shares your social media history."
"I use ok Google and it also requires my device to connect to the Internet to cross check my speech with servers to understand what I want it to do. "
"I completely expect there to be recordings and transcripts of. My search requests on googles side being sold for third party data purposes.Again, they aren't."
"You are easily tricked by blog spam I see.Someone tell me why I should care.Alright, Now they know How long i warm up my pizzas And how long I have to wait before eating after taking my thyroid medication.

"chimichanga spidermanThe Samsung TV baloney was baloney and so is this. Yes, this is how it works. It'd be like me admitting I made coffee this AM. Yes, I did.sound bites [sic]"
"Why is this incorrect?Depending on how literal you want to be, a sound bite would refer specifically to a short audio clip of speech used during a radio or TV broadcast.So it *has* to be used in radio or TV? I'm not buying that. "
"Why is it followed by sic, is what I want to know. I don't see why it's wrong. The generally accepted usage of sound bite would not extend to being any recording of someone talking. Whomever added the 'sic' is of that opinion. "
"From the OED:"
"> sound bite   n. orig. U.S. a brief extract from a recorded interview, statement, etc., usu. edited into a news report on account of its aphoristic or provocative quality; transf., a phrase or sentence intended by its speaker to be quoted in this way."
"From Websters:"
">  a short recorded statement that is broadcast on a television or radio news program"
"all together now: Siri, who sucks a dick?you know what... Fuck you apple; you just lost a customer.apple *admits* this is such a fucking non-story. it's in the terms you agree to when you use it. "
"the difference between this story and anything on buzzfeed is there isn't a top 10 list. it's just dumb clickbait because apple is a hot topic and people are stupid.If you want to improve voice interface systems this is pretty much the best way to go about it. "
"As long as everything is kept anonymous data wise and they do there due diligence on who they hire for this type of job I don't see it as a huge problem. Buy a new iPhone every 10 months? uSheep.Anyone who thought otherwise must have been willfully ignorant.I'm sure it's mentioned in the ToS that nobody reads. Anonymous data is reviewed to ensure the program is accurate? Yawnnnnnn.....Good thing it wasn't Samsung, or people would have started a boycott or something.We're not in the data business, we're in the device business. We make great products. We are different than Google."
"blablablais... is anyone surprised? Apple would suck hitlers dick for more money.I don't see this is a huge deal... So a company is contracted out to QA the speech recognition? Are we really that paranoid?this isn't a surprise (to me anyway).  Apple isn't the only operating system that does this, android and all the other smartphone OS's are all giving out info to third parties too. this isn't new information, its just getting easier for people to notice as new technology is released and when they start paying attention to the terms and conditions. "
"for this very reason I keep all location/GPS/voice recognition off on my devices unless I absolutely need it, then turn it off again when I'm done.People actually use Siri? I've had an iPhone since the 3GS came out, I currently have an iPhone 6+ right now. "
"I've used Siri literally ONCE, and that was a 2 second test on my 6+. I then turned it off because I was sick of accidentally pulling it up when texting in class. 1. Stop fucking texting in class."
"2. How the hell do you accidentally pull up Siri whilst using the keyboard?If you accidentally click the button on the keyboard for the voice to text, Siri 'talks' twice before you can exit and it plays out of the speaker even if the phone is on vibrate."
"I've also accidentally clicked the home button and held it down momentarily which brings up Siri who again, plays a voice message out of the speakers which is unskippable. "
"I also don't know why people waste time asking Siri shit that they could find in half the time on Google and without looking like a tool.It came up whenever the teacher tried taking his phone away for using it during class. Apple doesn't sell your data, unlike Google. -Tim Cook"
"He literally said this less than a week ago and r/apple got butthurt when I let em down easy.[deleted]Here, sir!"
"---F"
"It lost a prong.[deleted]It shouldn't.shared with your samsung tv :OAnd nobody gasped in surprise.Apple should be ashamed. But I'm ashamed instead. *cough cough* The stuff we talked about with Siri...Wow, this is a unforeseen surprise and an outrage said no one.I dont have a problem with this, as long as it is improving Siri.and to think you would have been called a Tinfoil hat consperitard a few years ago. Snowden for pres.BREAKING NEWS: JOURNALISTS HAVE READ <COMPANY HERE>'s EULA AND IT SHOWS <THING PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW HERE>If you didn't already think this was happening, in my opinion, you're seriously delusional...Data collection is out of fucking control. Besides not being online at all, what are steps you can take to remain somewhat anonymous and immune to these fucking vultures?  Not be online at all, don't buy anything will any card, wear a disguise anyplace with security cameras. Stay out of line of sight  of any ground viewing satellites, sleep in a faraday cage.But there's catch. No Faraday Cage emporiums in my area i could wear a disguise to to pay for in my Kruger Rand collection. FUCKING DILEMMA. And? How do you think they can translate your voice to text, they have to create the database or improve their algorithm somehow.  So much Apple hate comes out when Apple announces new products. The article clearly mentions other companies doing the same thing, then changes the context of what's actually being done. Should companies making voice-rec technology just say fuck it, it's good enough?"
"And with NSA eating up all the data they can on any network they can, I'd say that companies disclosing what they're doing in long end-user agreements is the least of our concerns."
"I'd be astounded to see even a single piece of real evidence that a major company fucked up ANY thing in someone's unimportant life with some worthless personal info they got that someone spoke to their phone (probably while around other people anyway). That would make way bigger waves than this article meant to fish for site views.Apple didn't admit anything as far as this article is concerned. The author simply reposts the reddit quote and then reposts a bit from the ToS. There are no statements from Apple included in the article."
"OP and author are bundles of sticks.So this is siri, is the galaxy equvalent the same?And this comes after they made that statement about their hardware and software being their products rather than the customers being the product. Lame.On the post for the apple watch the fanboys were defending apple and saying they would never share their private data. Why anybody would pay for such overpriced crap beggars belief.Who gives a shit. But i must be true because you saw it on reddit.Sigh. Every time Tim says something reasonable about privacy. Every fucking time ><And people will still buy apple productsWait, what!"
"Hear I was in my little bubble thinking that Apple was different, that they liked people because we're people, that Bill Gates gave Steve Jobs cancer to get a leg up on the competition, they even have an employee light a candle at the 'Jobs' shrine every time I make an iTunes purchase (I believe it's in the EULA, but then again I didn't read it because Apple is to technology as air is to breathing)... "
"Now you're telling me that Apple is just another corporation trying to squeeze every dollar it can from anywhere it can. From voluntarily ignorant people who didn't take a week to read the EULA no less. I for one won't be taken in by these 'fly by night' accusations."
"Sincerely,"
"Mr. Gull I. Ble (the e has an accent)I really don't see a problem with this. There's no reason for people to freak out about these things.Honestly is this a surprise in regards to any speech recognition software that requires online connection for the translation? It's anonymized from your phone or person unless you say your name. I can honestly count on one finger how many times I've personally told Siri my name, and that was when I set my phone up the first time. Freaking out about this (when the purpose is to try to make the recognition better) is pointless.This is not surprising but I do have a problem with Tim Cook talking like Apple is Holier-than-thou on privacy.You mean to tell me... that this whole time they have actually had that in that big group of words I always click I agree too? OUTRAGOUS Tl;Dr - Apple does something they say they'll do in the License Agreement every Siri-user has to accept first, non-Apple users are outraged.Correction:"
"non-Apple users who didn't read the linked article are outraged.Siri is notorious for listening even when you didn't ask her to! Fuck you apple and your affiliatesAnother thing that bugs me about this is, I've never heard of Apple using money for anything like advancing research and technology or other cool stuff. Not like I do for other companies.  Yet, here they are doing shady stuff for even more revenue while selling you garbage for $400 more than the competition, while probably being less functional. Similar to this woman's experience /u/Fallenmyst from the article, I got a sales job once that terrified me. It was for this software company and would have been the highest paid job I've ever had. I learned about the company though I couldn't take it. Seriously scary shit.

"Apple and Google Just Attended a Confidential Spy Summit in a Remote English Mansion | The three-day conference included current or former spy chiefs from seven countries, including the US and UK, plus academics and journalists to discuss government surveillance in the aftermath of Snowden's leaksConfidential spy summit."
"Includes Journalists."
"Something doesn't add up.I'm struggling to come up with a title that would have been more editorialized.What's not adding up? Journalists ARE spies. Whether they work for the cia ( a la cooper and probably most of cnn), or they work for firstlook and are charged with documenting intel that the corporate media won't,  journalists have always played an important roll in intelligence operations. Confidential spy summit."
"Front page of reddit.When the title is utter BS what are the odds I'll click the link vs. upvote the first person to point out that we're past tired of the thinly veiled BS? 10 out of 10."
"By no coincidence /u/kulkke is tagged as a poster of trash for selfish karma whoring. I'm close to just ignoring OP but they might make a turn around and stop with the horrible trash NSA/Snowden posts before that meme dies and they move on to the next cow that needs milking.Oh, you caught me champion - all I care about is earning some virtual points in a website, which all get associated with a registered nickname in that very website; and you champion, you managed to solve this just by yourself."
"At the end, if these points are not the things that we all should care about, than what do we live for, right mate? If these sweet points are not that meaningful or that important, than what can be the meaning of our lives?Truly the points just mean you did something that stirred the masses, not that you did something positive, especially when we see some of the utter BS that stirs people up when it should be laughed off and ignored."
"In the end when you're laying there dying and do an audit of what matters, having lead people on wild goose chases shouldn't bring much comfort. In fact it might seem like a terrible waste of time for something that brings you no real joy. "
"Manning, Snowden, Assange, etc.. are naive and foolish. I cringe as I see people misunderstand what the truth really is but honestly that's a burden which shouldn't be on everyone's shoulders. Just ask the people who know, they will gladly admit there's some bliss in ignorance.Oh my God, you caught me again. =/"
"I don't know what caused this absurd way of thinking of yours or in what kind of reality are you living in - but sure, the result is not even entertaining. But if you like to hear these, here it comes for you:"
"Yeah! Champion, you are one great person that unfolds the truth again and again; you are the person that finds the real intentions behind some nasty website accounts; you are the defender of Hgollarop. Hurra!Uhh look at my posting history. I'm not a champion, I'm a real person posting honest shit with zero aim for glory."
"If someone shadowbans this account it'll suddenly stop being used and I'll start using my other throwaways. When I post something too honest to the wrong crowd, I don't delete it to save myself from downvotes, because that's not the point."
"Keep on trying to reverse the mock, you're the one with the look at this laughable bullshit post history. I mean we're here on one of your greats about a CONFIDENTIAL SPY SUMMIT .. with Reporters .. LOL.. That's the very definition of laughable bullshit and that's the podium you're standing on.Hmm, sure, do you also want cookie mate?so confidential i's on reddit a few hours after it's done"
"i'm surprised there wasn't a live stream with commentary of the eventFuture shills for anti-privacy policies and programs...The journalists are their because they need to know how the big corps, want the news spun, what details to leave out and which to emphasize.Take journalists' names, see how they write up the parts of the summit they were allowed to see. Those who report what they're told are marked for future puppeteering, er, that is, careers as 'reliable sources'. Those who actually try to be journalists are marked to be kept out of sensitive areas and encouraged to report from war zones.then you never heard of bilderberg conferences, did you?Also:"
"> At an 18th-century mansion in England's countryside last week, current and former spy chiefs from seven countries **faced off** with representatives from tech giants Apple and Google"
"Here's what that facing off [looked like.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58JrxLL3u2s)Well perhaps they must deal with this kind of shit and they don't necessarily want it to be confidential. But its crazy to me that as a regular person I'm aware that all this mass surveillance is just big corp racket so why do google and apple act like they don't know what this is really aboutDuh they're telling the journalists what to report it's a cover up yoJournalists are going to only report on non-confidential stuff. This is some man of steel level logic."
"Super important mission to stop Zod from terraforming."
"Lois Lane is there.And most like they'll have some digital device on them, much easier to hack them when they come to you.This is the fake summit. The REAL one is happening next weekend ;)It was so confidential, nobody knows about it! I'd have to agree... I was all intrigued until they started naming off individuals per state/country like there's no tomorrow. Then it just started to sound like something I'd like to switch off. PR department meeting.The journalists are just attending so that their governmental and corporate overlords can tell them what they're not allowed to write about.Journalists have always been invited to this sort of thing."
"How else will they know what to report? What stories will they tell, or what should they keep quiet on. What keeps ratings up, without damaging the cause?"
"I use the term 'journalist' lightly, of course. Sensationalist reddit title. The actual article headline was less Sensationalist.\*Sigh*"
"/r/technology, why do I even bother.Yeah, I feel your pain. I used to love this shit, but self selection has me moving further and further into specific interests and out of the public dialogue.  I think there might actually be something to be said for maintaining these ties to public conceptions and understanding. If you move too far away, it will be hard to maintain a grasp on what the proles think and feel.They have to be taught how to spin this to the world.Lets see if the contents if this meeting are ever reported on.It makes perfect sense."
"Who do you think writes up those government propaganda and publishes them?"
"Journalist are recruited by spy agencies while still in college.  After graduation they get placements to work for major news agencies."
"journalists "
"If it's as shady as reddit is assuming then these journalists have zero integrity and are only there to learn what agenda to pedal through their respective media outlets."
"Just a thought,They have journalists there so they can tell them what to release to the public to make them look transparent and open.Exactly.  Confidential journalists are akin to jumbo shrimp.  It's an oxymoron.  Their job is to report.  Basically, I take out of this, anyone who doesn't hang is part of the party and can fuck off."
"To take a line out of Green Street Hooligans: fucking journos.I'm forever blowing bubbles,"
"Pretty bubbles in the air,"
"They fly so high,"
"Nearly reach the sky,"
"Then like my dreams,"
"They fade and die.Its so they can say but look, we invited these journalists! While in reality, those journalists have signed an NDA that will prevent them reporting on anything that was discussed."
"And even then, would you really want to piss off some of the most powerful spy agencies in the world?Pfft."
"The most powerful spy agencies in the world are the ones who can't afford to piss off the journalists."
"Everything the journalists get they're going to be able to publish or leverage into some other story.  "
"Sure the NYT plays lapdog to the government, but they do that in exchange for exclusives.  If the diva journalists get pissed off and have secret information, nothing is preventing them from just giving it to wikileaks where the government can't spin the story because they have no influence.  If they don't have a publishable story, then they're not losing anything when they give an unpublishable story away."
"*edit: not to mention the fact taht announcing it doesn't really gain any goodwill if the meeting is closed in any capacity.  They could have just not announced it and risked nothing at all.* "
"*Nobody is going to be thinking that a meeting of industry heads and spy agencies is progress in open government, and nobody NOTICES when the meetings are secret, so there's no benefit to trying to spin this.   So the simplest explanation is that this is completely genuine and they're looking for criticism.*"
"*And since:"
"1. *government meeting industry heads is super-suspicious* "
"2. *Coming to the conclusion that it's genuine requires thinking*"
"3. *people are idiots*"
"*A double-fakout would STILL result in worse PR than a closed meeting. The only reason they'd do this in public is if they actually wanted feedback.  If they had a closed feedback meeting there would be backlash later when it became public out of necessity for its function.  A closed* **evil** *meeting would stay closed after, so no backlash*You're making journalists out to be brave paragons that won't bow to threats made by government officials."
"Almost anyone is going to say yes sir, thank you sir when Johnny Law comes to tell you to do something. It's unfortunate, but there it is."
"It's like a pedestrian crossing the street. Sure, if you have Right of Way and get killed, the driver gets in trouble because you were in the right. But you're still dead.Didn't make it through the comment, huh?  That's okay, reading is hard."
"This part is what you're missing"
">nothing is preventing them from just giving it to wikileaks where the government can't spin the story because they have no influence. If they don't have a publishable story, then they're not losing anything when they give an unpublishable story away."
"Journalists don't need to be brave paragons, they just need to be capable getting pissed off and doing something that will subvert the government's intentions without getting caught."
"Leaking the info is plausibly deniable and it's easy enough to get away with that the government hasn't been able to close its own leaks.See that? See that key phrase? Without getting caught"
"That's the kicker. Hasn't worked out too well for the people who have actually done this, what makes you think it's suddenly so simple to release the info without fear of repercussion? Yeah, if I do a dead-drop then no one will know it was me! Those stupid Feds!! Why hasn't anyone thought of this before? -twirls mustache and dons trenchcoat-"
"But no, please just keep making snide comments in the hopes that no one will notice youre repeating yourself without adding anything else. While reading is hard, writing is harder. It's ok, no ones judging you.>That's the kicker. Hasn't worked out too well for the people who have actually done this, "
"Which journalists would that be? "
"Are you talking about Glenn Greenwald's underlings in the UK (and not the ones in the US)?"
"Drake's treatment didn't stop manning, manning's treatment didn't stop snowden, snowden's treatment didn't stop starling, none of those were journalists and all of them outed themselves.The thing preventing them is fear, individually. Everything you said makes sense enough with journalists as a group, but if they're found out or suspected shit gets real. Governments are very effective at destroying an individual's life ."
"Edit: before the edit.Don't talk about the Ministry of Love in an ungood way, they're listening and they'll send you to room 101.They put the wrong address on the invitations to the journalists. We invited a bunch of them... strange that none of them showed.  Huh, oh well.Yeah, I want a reddit ama!  NDA? That leaves a paper trail. Here's a million dollars, say anything we didn't tell you to or we kill you You sound like an anti conspiracy nut. How about you keep an eye on this story and post a link to the transcript. Do you suppose they are talking about how to secure our privacy?An NDA should be pretty effective not to mention legal and cheap."
"The reporter would likely be required to sign the NDA in front of summit representatives and hand it back right away.  He won't have a copy and not even any pictures.  His employer would have to do the equivalent."
"Even if a copy got leaked, it would have the reporter's name and the summit name once only hereafter referred to as ....  The rest would be fairly standard wording to say he can't tell anyone even the smallest detail from the summit."
"Should he break the NDA, he'd be in deep shit with his employer and some extremely powerful lawyers.A paper trail nobody will follow because a) nobody cares enough to look b) if they somehow did look AND report it, I doubt the American general public would give a solitary shit and the story would be buried in whatever dumb thing Justin Beiber said recently.>dumb thing Justin Beiber said recently."
"Right now they are all up in arms about the fact that Hillary Clinton sent *gasp* emails while she was secretary of state.they could have just had another secret industry meeting out of a million.   They do that all the time and nobody cares after a week.  They're not going to gain any public goodwill from a closed meeting so if they're restricting the press in any capacity it  would be cheaper safer and easier just to not announce it."
"The whole idea is a tinfoilhat conspiracy angle and both your hats are full of holes.Million dollars? Please. Here's your paycheck. Go pretend to be a journalist.NDA? That leaves a paper trail. Here's ~~a million dollars, say anything we didn't tell you to or we kill you~~ your head editor on the line. He's just gotten off the phone with the owner, and he says if you don't comply, you'll lose your job, get thoroughly discredited for some bullshit story from 20 years ago, and nobody will hire you as even a paperboy as long as you live. who do you think fabricates the cover stories?Can I put on my tinfoil hat now?WHY DID YOU TAKE IT _OFF_?!?I was getting it cleaned!I have some news for you. The hat's been compromised. In 1970s the [Church Committee investigated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Committee) and found there were [700 journalists secretly on the CIA payroll whose job was misinforming the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird#Church_Committee_investigations). What do you think that number is today? 7000 journalists? More?Wow, that's crazy. I never knew that!Holy crap. Is that for real? If that shit was going on then what the hell's going on today? Makes all those conspiracy theorists not seem so crazy.."
"Makes ya think, huh?Welcome to the rabbit hole.Given that the term conspiracy theorist was coined by the CIA...source?It's probably less expensive and more secure to make sure the good journalists are never successful, and that bad, easily controlled journalists are fed fabricated information and evidence.Yeah, that was the fake summit.  Microsoft and IBM were at the real one.Amazon too. People love Amazon but love to overlook the massive contract they won over IBM in the past year for an extreme scale solution for the NSA. I'd be more interested in where Cisco, Juniper, and Adtran are!In Zurich, with the gnomes ;)Juniper is at a conference about new ways to milk money out of people that have bought their hardware"
"Cisco is at a conference about new ways to use their cloud platform "
"Adtran is at a conference for hardware providers that have been almost completely forgotten about.Is Adtran still a thing?CenturyLink and other major internet providers use them as border routers all the time!  Not cheap either, but really shitty looking builds, IMO.Routers or DSLAMs?I've seen them used as DSLAMs at the provider border in MDFs and Copper over Ethernet media converters, although they provide routing/visibility functionality, too, for the provider.They're going to throw the journalists into a shark tank, obviously. Or the ones that don't cooperate. Or if everyone cooperates, a random one just to make a point.But do the sharks have lasers? What do you think the anthrax was for.... "
"oh sorry different story."
"Will the sharks have laser beams attached to their heads? There are no sharks, only ill-tempered sea bassDon't drop the sea bass! Well it's a start...The shark union is having a fit. No sharks would give their time, not even for a human snacky snack. A local farmhand let them borrow the wood chipper. It's one of those embedded journalists, but really just a regime scriber."
"btw. I don't think these companies realises how fast the world and competition will turn against them. They think they are the only one who can provide whatever service they are doing right now.-They think they are the only one who can provide whatever service they are doing right now."
"Arguably they are in certain areas of product/service....>They think they are the only one who can provide whatever service they are doing right now."
"If they play it right, they'll definitely try to make it that way. >Or if everyone cooperates, a random one just to make a point."
"This I likeWell I didn't pay for a giant fucking shark tank to NOT throw people in!If only there was a button that you could press to indicate that you enjoyed a commentDo the sharks have freakin laser beams on their heads?Yes the Sharks will indeed have ***frickin'*** laser beams on their heads!What are you going to do, release the hounds? Or the bees? Or the hounds with bees in their mouths, so that when they bark they shoot bees at you?They are actually autonomous robot-sharks with railguns.No, they wear Google Glass. A bit underwhelming if you ask me.No they have jet fuel.I think you meant * frikken*, Scott.Now, how shall I kill you? Acid, or Sharks?"
"*I don't know milord, they both sound terrible*"
"Acid Sharks it is.Are those sharks that swim in acid or sharks that spit acid?Sharks covered in lemon juice and have attachments to squirt lemon juice. You know, so that it stings a lot when they bite you.They both swim in acid and are, thusly, mostly acid themselves. The saliva of an acid shark is usually more acidic than the surrounding fluid, so the bites hurt extra bad.Or the dogs. Or the bees. Or the dogs that when they bark they shoot bees out of their mouth... Sharks that are acidCould be sharks that just swallow you whole so you dissolve in their stomach acid.Toothless sharksBut isn't the whole shark skin like many many teeth?Skinless and toothless thentell my mother-in-law I said hi and fuck off.We throw some LSD into the poolThat is truly horrificShould into water, journalists into pool, wait an hour, RELEASE THE SHARKS! or just tell them there are sharks in there after the acid kicks in...If you're lucky, they'll eat it first and will be too high to eat you.Or they throw THC into the pool and the sharks get mad munchies and eat you faster, leaving human crumbs all over their favorite airbrush style Bob Marley t-shirt. Nah, they would probably just forget me overnight in their oven. Luckily, they were too high to turn the oven on. are they at least ill tempered?Thats a pretty shitty confidential spy summit if we're reading about it online...Goddamn Mainstream Media always covering up the troofs On that same note, it usually irritates me when headlines include the world quietly (seems especially common in /r/politics). It's like the author's suggesting that any trivial act must be considered clandestine and underhanded because the people involved didn't hold an immediate press conference, even though they made no effort to conceal anything (as evidenced by the fact it was covered by mainstream journalism).smoke and mirrors by the worst offendersReminds me of the joke that the problem with the CIA is that it is best known for its covert activities.I think you're mixing up confidential and secret. We know almost nothing of what was discussed aside from intended topics, so I'd say it's definitely confidential.The content of what is discussed is not confidential. It operates under the [Chatham House rule](http://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule), meaning all the content can be repeated, but the person who said it needs to be kept confidential."

I just lost a lot of my respect for The Intercept. Your explanation of the Chatham House Rule is correct, [source](http://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule). The Intercept, however, writes:"
"> [...] took place behind closed doors and under strict rules about confidentiality [...]"
"> The discussions are held under what is called the Chatham House Rule, meaning what is said by each attendee during the meetings cannot be publicly revealed, a setup intended to encourage open and frank discussion. "
"While one can claim that's not an outright lie, it's at least very, very misleading."
"Given this context, the headline is also misleading clickbait. Yes, it's true, but it's unlikely to mean what it attempts to imply (the companies discussing how to do more surveillance)."
"Another quote from the article is more interesting:"
"> There was **general agreement** across broad divides of opinion that Snowden - love him or hate him - had changed the landscape; and that **change towards transparency**, or at least 'translucency' and providing more information about intelligence activities affecting privacy, was **both overdue and necessary**.Ah, this is a very common misunderstanding of the Chatham House Rule. "
"TFA even links to that same explanation on the CH site that you link to. They just didn't bother to read it, I guess--this looks more like incompetent, sloppy, writing-on-the-hoof than anything more sinister. "
">the headline is also misleading clickbait"
"We knew that before reading the article. What were you expecting?[deleted][deleted]Yeah, it probably is some kind of conspiracy. The world elite meeting in secret, off the record, off the books. Royalty, politicians, media tycoons, think tanks, academia, corporations, banking etc. I don't expect these people are trying to solve world hunger -- when you look who has been guests -- in previous years.Or they are just powerful or well k known people to get together to talk about world events and don't want the media scrutinizing their every word.

Who changed their name to BlackBerry a while back.Interesting, I didn't know that. that berry that was shot by the cops last monthilluminati confirmedAlso present: The Queen, the Rothchilds, the Gettys, the Pope, and The Colonel, with his wee beady eyes.Oooh, you going to buy my chicken!Close enoughIs there a single instance of terrorism being organized by the internet? Has cyber spying caught one single terrorist? No. Has the Patriot Act or TSA powers stopped any real terrorist? No. The cyber spying has absolutely Nothing to do with terrorism, and all to do with keeping Government crimes hidden...Nice, but all your no's are really just speculation. Wonder if Reddit will be mentioned? Probably as an international threat to productivity.I'm sure they're right. Transcripts will be available on Wikileaks the week after the conference.Discuss government surveillence. Yeah."
"Discuss how to improve it further.It is hard to imagine what Google and Apple look like attending this meeting.  Is it two guys in a mascot costume or the spirit of the company floating through the hallways. Known as.... The pentaverate. They talked about how to help spy even better.Is it known as the meadows?TIL: Spy chiefs exist.I couldn't help but imagine a bunch of people in suits covering spy tactics in a mansion on a mountain.and the Wi-Fi password was NSAAnd then what, Mr. Bond showed up? As if these topics weren't talked about before amongst these groups. This is to posture Apple and Google in a way to make it seem that they were naive to the NSA using their systems to spy and the consequences of it.   This is damage control,  especially considering the effects the NSA has had on u.s. tech sales internationally.Did James Bond attend aswell?No, James Bond attended Eaton.James Bond attended Fettes for the majority of his school career! "
"He only attended Eton for 2 terms (3 terms make a year) and then left due to an alledged incident with one of the maids... I wouldn't suggest that attending a school for less than a full year warrants suggestion that that is where he was educated."
"Also Eaton is a very different school to Eton.[deleted]The journalist they quoted extensively in that Intercept article has published [his full write-up of the event](http://www.duncancampbell.org/content/talking-gchq-interception-not-required)."
"Duncan is notable because he's been [covering this stuff since the 70s]( http://www.duncancampbell.org/content/surveillance), including being prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act for his earlier work.

"Are you sure it wasn't Stately Wayne Manor?Is that Wilton House? I used to live super close! Journalists from CNN, Fox and NBCThat mansion looks a lot like the mansion in The Remains of the Day movie starring Anthony Hopkins.There are a [surprisingly large number of such houses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_country_house) in the UK - *The Remains of the Day* was [shot at several houses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Remains_of_the_Day_%28film%29#Settings), though Ditchley Park [doesn't appear to be one of them](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107943/locations).This is how Spectre starts.People really have to understand the job of these spy agencies is to protect the power that governments have nothing more nothing less.

"It;s disgusting that society is such a way where people are expected to not say their honest opinions about things publicly. Remote English Mansion <-- about 5km outside Oxford is not in the slightest bit remote.Was it at Castle Greyskull or Castle Skyfall?rip Microsoft I have a [spy summit] (http://imgur.com/K4bismo) too!dat camera shake tho.Actually, it's not bad at all.  It stabilizes itself very wellI'm not a fan of post-image stabilization. Even having the thing mounted on springs with rubber washers would create a decent albeit crude OIS that would let you get that much more quality content from it.Doesn't sound very spy-like since we know about itWhat does Apple have to do with it? Google owns Internet. Apple has a thousand naked celebrity photos available on torrents. Are they there to show off their new useless watch?

"Secret meeting... - obviously not if you're reporting on it. "
"Never released documents... - if you've read them and are presenting them then they're released.  "

"About this:"
"Heads of the biggest tech companies meet with international spies to discuss national securities after Snowden leak. "
"This feels sensationalized. It's not really a secret confidential meeting if all the world knows of it.

"I'm not saying it's a bad thing, it's actually good (as long as you don't have an ex in power or piss off the wrong geek at that dinner party).This is a bullshit article. It's a conference....ditchley is even less secretive than Davos. Also they mischaracterized the Chatham house rule. You can report on what was said and use the information, it's just not attributable to a particular source. International conferences use it all the time to encourage open and frank discussion on sensitive matters.How remote can anything in England be? 53 million people in something the size of Alabama (population 5 million). Everything's relative I suppose.How do you know?Totally believable. Oh yeah.You can be the new mod of /r/whogivesafuck"
"Apple CEO: If you halt or weaken encryption, the people that you hurt are not the folks that want to do bad things. It's the good people. The other people know where to go.>Halt encryption"
"Literally the dumbest thing that anyone could ever think of. It is the core element of network security. Without it, there is no such thing as secure communication over the internet.It's all fun and games until someone in power gets their iMessages sniffed on a public network.More like the password to their bank account.I agree with him. If you outlaw encryption, only outlaws will have encryption. I've heard the exact same argument used with 'gun' in place of 'encryption'. Of course, the key difference is that one protects your property with deadly force, while the other protects it with passive force.Sounds like a familiar sentiment. Yet the government has no problem regulating weapons. I'm not a gun advocate necessarily but it seems like common sense to me that when you outlaw anything you just create a black market for it. Same argument for the second amendment.Sure. But we'll be able to crack the encryptionSame argument is used by pro gunners about gun control. Ban guns, only criminals will have guns. What about guns?Like gun control. The NRA can use this exact slogan. 'If you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns.'And then yay the rest of us who use encryption to be secure will be monitored since we would be indistinguishable from the outlaws  Just like with gunsWhen did politicians start believing that making something illegal will stop criminals... they're fucking criminals. If they didn't want to break the law they wouldn't be criminals in the first place. Boggles my mind."
"Better not encrypt my coke trafficking operation... because that's illegal.... Wat!If we outlaw encryption, we will no longer be able to exchange commerce on the internet legally.Except thats a good thing for them because there's less encrypted traffic for them to filter throughWell that's the technical term.Encryption is never going to be outlawed. People don't understand that Encryption is not something you do when you go to your underground layer. Encryption = Internet = Gaming = Cars = Airplanes. You can't simply stop Encryption....Encryption is Love Encryption is Life. This is the same argument used by pro gun individuals in the US. It is just as relevant in this situation. I wonder if he agrees that same logic applies to gun control. Not really comparable. I don't need to go to a store to buy encryption - nor can I read a book and magic a gun out of thin air."
"c04f0f728c77b6286ccf07878a61bb834c61296253bbf95f3ebd6321fb5d7904Nor can you read a book and magic competent encryption out of thin air. It's *hard* to implement.But in the future, you will be able to 3D print guns, so ...You don't need to go to a store to get a gun either. Getting a gun illegally is likely easier than teaching yourself encryption well enough to do it yourself. > Getting a gun illegally is likely easier than teaching yourself encryption well enough to do it yourself."

"Who are you contradicting? No one said that. The subject was whether outlawing guns could eradicate them.100% comparable...  It's actually a very popular thing to build your own firearms (usually an AR-15 platform) at home."

"Isn't it illegal to manufacture the receiver w/o a license? Nope.  It's illegal to manufacturer the receiver with intent to sell w/o a license.  It's legal to build a receiver for personal use.  3D Printers and milling tools are less accessible than thin air.They're both relatively cheap to buy, though. Pretty inconspicuous, too.

"You could download a gun :)http://cdn.project-disco.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/YouWouldntDownloadACar1.jpgyeah you actually can. Im pretty sure people were freaking out over a 3D printable one called the patriot.[Liberator*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberator_\(gun\))close enough lol :)Guns aren't magic. You can build a rudimentary one relatively easily. [This](http://www.northeastshooters.com/vbulletin/threads/179192-DIY-Shovel-AK-photo-tsunami-warning) dude made an AK almost completely out of a shovel with basic tools. You can make a simple shotgun out of a nail and two pieces of pipe. Most gun designs that are considered modern are from the 60s or before, newer guns just iterate on those same basic designs. No, he built a receiver, which is the easiest part of an AK to build. Now let's see him build a barrel and a bolt.He built about the same percentage of that gun as someone implementing a cryptographic package built the encryption. He also didn't mine the ore to make the metal. You'd be surprised how easy to is to encrypt something well starting from scratch, and you'd be similarly surprised how non-functional a receiver is without a barrel and a fire control group, let alone a bolt.I'm a sysadmin for a living and I own several guns including a few that I put together, so I wouldn't be surprised by any of those things. Bolts aren't hard to come by in this country, neither are barrels or fire   control groups. The engineering specs for all those things are also no more a secret than the math that you need to encrypt something. I imagine homemade bullets are a lot harder to make.The bullets themselves aren't the hard part. For bullets you just make a mold, melt some metal, and pour it in the mold. They're just a solid piece of metal. The hardest part of making a fully functional round is the primer, because it requires very precise work. But knowing that, you could always modify the design of the gun you're making to use rounds that don't require that sort of primer, if you know you're going to be making your own ammo from scratch. Do you not also need to make gunpowder? Sounds quite complicated as compared to downloading some encryption software.you don't really even need gunpowder, but you do need a method of propulsion.It's all about skills you already have. It's easier for someone who is on here already to encrypt something using their computer, sure. But people, say where I grew up, out in the sticks. A lot of them already know how to make black powder. Smokeless powder is harder, but from what I know black powder isn't that hard and people still use it to hunt. They don't make it themselves because they can buy it, but a lot of them know how. Those people on the other hand would have a much harder time properly encrypting something and an even harder time actually coming up with encryption themselves. It's more about the materials you need access to. Yes some people might know more about manufacturing certain physical items than how to program or use software. "
"Point is the only physical materials you need to do encryption is a general purpose computer, you can't deny that's a whole lot easier to get than the tools and materials necessary to make a firearm."
"No, but you need materials as well as the instructions to make a gun."
"To use encryption you just need the equation. Computers make it faster, but you could do it by hand it you really wanted to (I wouldn't recommend it).To use encryption effectively, you need a computer. Nobody is SHA512 encrypting an entire message by hand, except cryptographers maybe. You also still need instructions to encrypt something, you need to understand math at a high level as well as knowing the algorithm if you're not using a computer. If you're using a computer, you need to know how to encrypt the message and how to send it, plus have the software to do so.Gun materials: Gunpowder and household junk + simple knowledge.  "
"Encryption materials: Computer and education + complex knowledge.  "
"Not a big barrier to entry for either.But they're not talking about outlawing a specific set of encrypted data -- they're talking about outlawing encryption.  That's like outlawing the knowledge of how to make a gun out of a shovel with basic tools, NOT outlawing the gun itself."
"Which makes enforcement something that belongs to the Thought Police: I see that you're doing something with that data that sure looks like it is transforming it into something unrecognizable.  I don't care if it's your bank account number or the plans to a secret airplane... what you're doing is illegal and must be stopped!"
"Here's another thought: what's the difference between encryption and encoding in general?  Are they going to make binary blobs and network level compression illegal too?  Because strong compression is indistinguishable from strong encryption.A nail and two pieces of pipe aren't thin air."
"Encryption is also less likely to prune you out through natural selection when you accidentally make a pipebomb and trigger it next to your face.You don't encrypt things out of thin air either. Unless you're literally doing the math to encrypt and decrypt something yourself, which the average person is not doing or going to do."
"Edit: effectively encrypt I should say. You can technically encrypt something with a caesar cipher easily without a computer or some other hardware, and it would be broken pretty much immediately. People didn't used to send bullets going 1500-2500 feet per second, until somebody thought up the gun. Your argument is like saying You don't shoot things out of thin air. Unless you're literally throwing a bullet 1500-2500 feet per second to cause damage to something, yourself, which the average person could not do."
"Of course they can't. That's the point of a gun. Likewise, calculating by hand RSA encryption has little practical use. The technology that actually *enacts* RSA encryption is very useful."
"Just because some individual cannot do it themselves, doesn't mean there isn't a solution that does it, or does it very, very well."
"That's really what is incredible about being human. If you have a problem, it's very likely that it's been solved, at least to some extent. If you're resourceful enough, you can take hold of that solution. Somebody's already out-thought you and figured out how to solve the problem. You just haven't found that solution, yet.> You can build a rudimentary one relatively easily. This[1] dude made an AK almost completely out of a shovel with basic tools."
"lol yeah, all you need is a full metal shop with a forge, a magazine, and the ammo. So easy! That's why, as we all know, criminals make their guns instead of buying them from straw purchasers.People are so far removed from how things work it is hilarious. That forge is some concrete sitting over top of some brick and with fire inside. Magazines (not clips) are just bent metal and a spring. The ammo is the hardest part to make yourself, more specifically the primer, but you can still do it. High-quality firearms were being manufactured long before steam engines were invented. do you know how many shooting sprees have been committed by people with home made guns in countries with stricter gun laws?[deleted]Compared to the rest of the civilized world it's the largest factor."
"Is mental health an issue? Yes. Media coverage? Yes. Preexisting crime rates? Yes."
"Does making it harder to get guns have a more immediate effect? Overwhelmingly, yes.Well it's a large part of it. You do know that In most of the shooting sprees that occurred in states with gun control, the guns were obtained in states without control, right?It's certainly a big factor.I think Americans fail to understand that *guns* aren't the American exclusivity, *gun violence* is."
"Guns don't kill people, but people without guns don't shoot people.Although to be fair the entire point of this comment thread is that if you outlaw X, only the outlaws will have X the point is there won't be a place where people don't have guns to shoot people. The whole concept is that isn't possible. You just create a place where only the criminals that want to shoot people have guns. "
"Criminals have guns in both scenarios, the difference is that law abiding citizens don't. None because there's no point for now. If you banned 100% of all guns, that's when you would see homemade guns, just like you already see homemade bombs. No amount of legislation can prevent people from killing each other. Humans are too fragile.I don't recall seeing any homemade guns while in the UK. You can still get guns in the UK. You can get up to a .22 rifle in the UK for pest controlYou mean [like this?](http://imgur.com/MkJSRRB)"
"That is a .22 I bought for my dad for his birthday.So I've always considered myself more on the anti-gun side than the pro-gun side but I understand that complete prohibition won't work (just like with drugs and such), but I've never really seen an argument that adequately explains a responsible pro-gun opinion (ie a good way to have pro-gun [rights] legislation while simultaneously reducing gun violence). Do you have one/know of one? Not trying to be a dick or anything, just would like to be more informed on the topic.Yes, we need more conceal carriers, and we need to get rid of gun free zones. Think about it, what is the one thing that stops an active shooter? Police right? Well how do they stop the shooter? They shoot the shooter... with a gun. You could argue vigilantism should be left to trained adults, but conceal carriers go through mandatory training already. And people practise shooting guns all the time for fun, so it's not like accuracy would be an issue. [There are already many examples of people taking down shooters with their own guns](http://www.personaldefenseworld.com/2015/03/10-cases-where-an-armed-citizen-took-down-an-active-shooter/#10-cases-where-an-armed-citizen-took-down-an-active-shooter-2), and since conceal carrying is getting more popular, I expect to see more stories of people preventing or mitagating shootings.Ok fair enough but a lot of people (myself included) are just uneasy with the idea of anyone being able to have a gun on them. Like there are a lot of people who would pass a screening process but could still have crazy anger issues (ie road rage).  I know they are definitely a huge minority and 99% of gun owners are responsible but that 1% scares the shit out of me.Here are some statistics that should make you more comfortable then."
"Gun ownership is already common. 1 in 3 people own guns. You've gone your whole life surrounded by gun owners."
"Everyone aside from convicted felons are already allowed to have a gun on them. Everyone can already transport guns in their car. We bassically have unrestricted access to firearms in this country, and we haven't descended into anarchy. Anyone who wants to kill people already has unlimited freedom to pick up a weapon and kill people, yet it's extremely rare. "
"Relative to other ways to die, guns should be the least of your worries. If you're confident enough to get on the freeway, there's no reason to be scared of guns. Over a million people die a year to car accidents. About 10k die a year to guns. I just don't understand how it's so scary. I'd be more worried about a bad diet than guns."
"Crime is at an all time low. You're living in the safest time in american history, and our gun laws have only been getting more relaxed. Gun laws used to be really restrictive, even in red states because people feared black people. Over the past 50 years, we've made huge amounts of progress in expanding gun rights, and we're only getting safer. This is actually a terrible argument. One would expect most shootings to occur via large-scale manufactured guns because there are far more of them and in the USA they are (for people who aren't good at DIYs) actually easier to come by. Make store bought guns illegal long enough and you won't be surprised to find out how many more murders there are committed by home-made weaponry.None, because why would you make an inferior product to do the job of a superior product that's easily obtained?What's your point? It's obviously still possible to acquire mass manufactured guns in those countries, and that's far easier than making your own. But if literally all guns were outlawed and unable to be acquired, then you can bet people would make their own guns.> http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2015/08/11/mystery-9mm-machine-pistol-seized-europe/"
"Soon, many."
"The Charlie Hebdo shooters didn't even need to make their own, and that was in France.ask chicago.None, they use either the guns they can still get or other means like arson/bombs. My point is that guns aren't magic. They're made from pretty basic materials. Funny you mention that.  In recent months police agencies have been finding these mysterious fully automatic machine pistols all across rights restrictive European nations...  http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2015/08/11/mystery-9mm-machine-pistol-seized-europe/"
"The origin of the pistol is still unknown.Oh what a shocker, criminals can get guns even if they are banned!"
"I don't understand why its so hard for people to understand this. [deleted]One thing I find very curious is the fake manufacturer markings.  If they are fake, then why bother doing the work to make them?  Is there some sort of underground product market to the point where there is brand recognition or something?I'd imagine so. With out some sort of name you're gonna walk up to your underworld gun dealer and ask for the black one with no name. It helps give a way to reference it just like people brand their weed or other drugs. So you know your getting the same thin you ordered before.I could make a bomb out of stuff I can buy at the hardware store. But we don't have complete assembled bombs on the shelf for sale because this would obviously lead to more bombings.The exact same logic applies. Both are tools that law abiding citizens can use to protect themselves and their privacy, while they're also capable of misuse by criminals. Any kind of ban only applies to law abiding individuals (by definition)."
"The only differences appear in their perceptions. One person might think Yes! Outlaw encryption because I don't have anything to hide while another person might say Yes! Ban guns because I don't have/like/want one.A gun is a phyical thing. You can't read a book and suddenly have a gun in your hand, or download ammunition."
"Encryption is an algorithm, a numerical recipe. A more apt analogy would be banning the recipe for gun powder and claiming this will stop terrorists from shooting people.would you download a bullet?The difference here is that it is literally impossible to outlaw encryption. Anyone with basic computer literacy can set up encrypted communication no matter how much the government tells us it's illegal. It's just math.We just have to encrypt guns and then guns are impossible to outlaw. Checkmate.The difference here is that it is literally impossible to outlaw guns. Anyone with a 3D-Printer or lathe and basic machining skills can make a gun, no matter how much the government tells us it's illegal. It's just fabrication.It's baffling how much Reddit loves to believe and enforce their echo chamber. What you said is entirely accurate, and yet they seem to think it's incredibly easy to just find a CS major who will encrypt stuff for you. I bet it's easier to convince a local machinist to break the law and make a gun than to convince a CS major to do it. But all it takes is a couple people downvoting you to hide your counterargument and help them maintain their hilariously ignorant confirmation bias. It's equal parts funny and sad.But you only need a few CS majors for everyone to have encryption."
"Also the encryption export bans didn't work either.CS majors are people, not vending machines. Not everything uses encryption, and it isn't suddenly going to start if it becomes illegal.What are you trying to say here? I honestly don't get how that applies to what I said.>find a CS major who will encrypt stuff for you"
"Why would you need to do that? There are loads of extensions and add-ons that allow you to use encryption by literally just clicking a few buttons:"
"[Virtu email encryption](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/virtru-email-encryption/nemmanchfojaehgkbgcfmdiidbopakpp?hl=en-US)"
"[Encipher It](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/encipher-it/fimncfoplhkgepigcpgjheeccdhemcfj?hl=en)"
"[Cryptocat](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cryptocat/gonbigodpnfghidmnphnadhepmbabhij?hl=en)"
"etc.It's a sad day when reddit has fallen so far that its users think running a few GPG commands requires a CS majorI mean, not necessarily a gunpowder firearm, although that's not *that* complicated, but everyone and their mom can make something deadly with much ease. Encryption, though, that shit is mad science to the overwhelming majority of people.But you don't need to *create* the crypto, merely download software. The issue isn't that the technology is trivial, the issue is that it's merely information and can be freely transmitted, copied, installed, and used by anyone. "
"Guns are tangible property, so while it's certainly possible for people to exchange the commodity, it takes a good deal more effort to acquire an illegally made or smuggled gun than to download freely available software. "
"Think about the protest aspect as well. If all guns were outlawed and collected, it would require a pretty substantial effort to distribute guns to a major share of the population. But digital revolutionaries need only publish openly licensed open source software from an off-shore server to completely subvert the ban... and the entity engaging in this protest doesn't even need to spend a lot of money or risk prosecution."
"Finally, consider enforcement. Exactly how would a ban on encryption be enforced? To know there is encryption at all, the government entity enforcing the ban would need to intrusively monitor billions of digital communications devices on a fairly constant basis. But if the crypto is any good, it would be nearly impossible to even detect in the first place, whereas a gun would become fairly easy to spot the moment it was used. So while enforcing a ban on guns would probably be difficult, enforcing a ban on cryptography would be literally impossible. You don't need to be a CS Major to set up some encryption software. You just need to know how to use Google and have the ability to read for about 10 minutes. That's a lot less skill than 3d printing a working gun (which you still have to buy the ammunition for from somewhere)Wasn't there a design on the internet a bit back for an m16 that is good for a few hundred rounds."
"So technically anyone who is good at google fu can make a gun.Yes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DconsfGsXyA"
"They get to about 30 rounds in that video but I assume they've made more progress.Oh this is what we're gonna do today? We're gonna fight?This is just a wild guess, but I'd say computers/computer skills are a bit more common in the general populace than machining equipment/machining skills. Also bullets.I am actually very pro-gun, but I really don't think it does any good to bring it up in this situation. The UK (which has already essentially outlawed guns) now wants to outlaw encryption, and my point is that no matter how hard they try, they will never be able to outlaw encryption with the same effectiveness that they have outlawed guns."
"The UK hasn't outlawed guns or anything like it. It has LICENSED guns and there are over 1.8 million in private ownership. Thats a lot for a country of 65 million where guns are supposed to be outlawed. "
"Millions of people in this country have fired weapons you're not even allowed to as a civilian in the USA such as fully automatic assault rifles. By the age of 14 I'd fired everything from a .22 rifle through to a 7.62 GPMG, the British equivalent of the M60, and a 40mm Bofors anti-aircraft gun."
"Shit if I want to fire a gun here in England without a firearms license I can walk half a mile to my local gun club any weekday night, pay a PS4 non member range fee, pay for my ammunition and use one of their club target rifles.You can own machine guns in the USA. It's complicated and like everything else, partially state specific, but you can.The principle is the same for both, the difference is that encrypting something takes literally millionths of the effort machining a(n effective) gun does.One time pads are dead simple and can be done using pen and paper. So long as the key is random and never reused, it's an incredibly strong system.That doesn't make it impossible to outlaw it. At all. It makes it impossible to eradicate it. "
"Which is also true of alcohol, drugs, guns, and basically any other highly marketable thing. Outlawing them does not make them go away - except in the hands of those who revere the law above all else i.e. *not* criminals.>That doesn't make it impossible to outlaw it. At all. It makes it impossible to eradicate it."
"Sure, a semantic error. You knew what I meant."
">Which is also true of alcohol, drugs, guns"
"Encryption is different from these things in that it is not a physical, tangible thing. It is essentially just an idea. A government can no more prevent multiplying two numbers together than they can prevent encryption (actually that's really all [encryption](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(algorithm\)) is). I agree that drugs and guns cannot truly be completely eradicated, but they can be to a much greater degree than encryption can.And to take it a step further, if you know the the government is looking for encrypted traffic, you can start hiding communications inside other data. For example, I wrote a working program that let me hide the entire text of the Neuromancer inside this image:"
"http://i.imgur.com/hR1dRZB.png"
"Granted, this is not the actual image file, I used a bitmap (which would be considerably larger in size) but it *can* be done. You'd never know there was any information hidden unless you knew specifically *where* to look (it is possible to find it, see if you can!), and even if you found it, you'd still not be able to read it unless you had the encryption key.ELI5, where is the data in this image? Sounds really coolIt's called [Steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography) and it's pretty cool.It's hard to get a true ELI5 explanation, but bear with me. "
"Any computer image is nothing but a huge array of pixels. Each pixel requires a certain amount of data to accurately convey color. In this case, each pixel uses three bytes. This is called 24 bit color mode. Each byte consists of eight bits. (8 bits *x* 3 bytes = 24 bits). What I do is take the least significant bit of each byte, and set it to one bit of payload data. You are left with an intact image that is visibly indistinguishable from the original. The payload data can be arbitrary, but in this case, I included an encrypted, compressed text file of the story The Neuromancer."
"The amount of data you can hide is determined by the geometry of the file. Let's say you have a 640x480 bitmap. Each pixel needs three bytes, and each byte can hold one bit of payload data. So... this bitmap would be approximately 921 KB. That means, I can hide 921 Kb (kilobits) or 115 Kilobytes. You can hide a LOT of data in 115 kilobytes.Thanks for that explanation! I suppose you don't even need a reference image to determine what data is there so long as you know the image is carrying a payload.Correct. There is a fixed scheme for how the data is stored. If you supply the correct key, it will be there. If you don't, you'll never be able to distinguish what's there from background noise.To elaborate (someone correct me if I'm wrong), the data being hidden in the picture is only a layer of obscurity (not encryption). It's like hiding a box in the bushes. "
"He mentions that, once unpacked, his payload is encrypted. So it's like he hid a box in the bushes, but also put a lock on it. Now someone would need to find the box AND have the key to unlock it."
"This distinction is an important one in cryptography because simply coding your payload into a picture like that could be easily intercepted if anyone ever deciphered the process (in this case, to look at the least significant bit of each byte).Comparing encryption to locks is misleading.  Encryption transforms the data.  So it's more like he took a box and stuck it inside wet concrete molded into the shape of a rock, and then  hid THAT in the bushes.  Now someone needs to find the rock, AND know that there's something inside worth chipping away at it to get."
"But you're right: steganography requires the original content be properly encrypted (such that cryptanalysis doesn't find any non-random repeating features) or else discovering the encoded content and then reversing it becomes trivial and can be automated.I mean the same applies to every illegal act. They've banned certain things but they keep getting done by the criminals who don't care about the law. Murder is illegal but that doesn't stop hundreds from being murdered every year. Drugs are illegal but that doesn't stop literally anyone from getting and using them. "
"Banning encryption only serves to make the innocent more vulnerable. Correct. You cannot uninvent something that already exists."
"It's staggering how many people I speak with that do not get this simple idea.Guns have been invented, yet are illegal in many countries. Same with cocaine. Right, because it's so hard to get cocaine or guns in countries where they are illegal.As is marijuana.If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns. Yeah but you cannot un-invent a gun or cocaine. People still use guns and cocaine even when illegal.Encryption algorithms are widely available (you can download from another country or ask an CS undergrad to code one up for you). At least with physical goods you have a chance at restricting access.So... basically.. Personally encrypt shit you want to keep private? Isn't this a given? Anyone who values encryption can't trust a corporation that is also lobbying for something else. If they want it bad enough, they'll sacrifice anything provided they can still deny it. "
"Sure we can trust Apple, Google or DroptoNSAbox, but that is just ignorance. Look at The Fappening.. Look at Google. They're a company that started off based on AD revenue.. You think your personal information is something they want locked away and inaccessible? Like discovering a inhabited continent Tell that to the war on drugs. I'm just saying. This is Apple we're talking about. Nothing is invented until they invent it.>  You cannot uninvent something that already exists."
"Counterargument: Like crypto, child porn exists and can be copied at zero cost, but banning it reduces its availability to everybody, including the criminal element."
"So banning stuff, even trivially producible stuff,  often works OK.>It's staggering how many people I speak with that do not get this simple idea."
"I get it, but from a certain perspective it isn't. "
"For many American's (or, humans in general), their exposure to technology isn't from a position of an informed consumer."
"Take for example: "
"* Verizon Wireless has a new ad that touts 50% less cost for their 'XXL' data package."
"* Fine print: 'compared to the next lowest tier'"
"Wat. Da. Fug. That's just one example. "
"Reddit, especially /r/technology, has a user bias as most users are embraced to modern technology, more informed, and passionate about keeping it free."
"That's not the case elsewhere."
"Look at Comcast. They own media outlets for a reason. (Granted, many reasons...). Imagine being able to influence people across multiple media outlets, while at the same time creating artificial limits in the communication pipelines (the internet) to boost profits. "
"So when it comes to things like cybersecurity, encryption, etc., how can we expect the average citizen that can't program their own DVR to understand it?"
"I passionately think (speaking as a US citizen) US citizens need to know more about encryption, don't think I'm arguing anything different."
"The way technology is changing, the population body really will have a hard time keeping up. As we approach the 'AI bubble' where algorithms and slick programming are going to start replacing jobs, we talk about it and it's exciting but we often forget something: **We're not telling people to stop getting degrees in areas that are going to get replaced; on a larger scale, we have no plan for what to do when thousands and thousands of jobs are replaced**."
"The other day I saw a machine that was flipping a sign. Yep. They automated the need for a sign flipper. Then we start thinking about automation in bigger categories. Fast food. Trucking. Driving. "
"Point is, all of this stuff is changing and we really need to understand that the population majority won't understand it. At that point something like encryption becomes an argument of Aren't you tough on crime?. Same reason bills like the Patriot Act pass. It's not patriotic. It's just a name. If you don't support it, YOU AREN'T A PATRIOT."
"You don't support banning encryption? YOU SUPPORT CYBERCRIME."
"Fucking awful. "
"The thing that's kind of more ridiculous is the existence of one-time pads.  Trivially simple encryption that's also perfect, and works just fine for digital messages or written ones.  They DO require organization though.So you're saying you can't put the shit back in to the horse?I don't see why a skilled surgeon couldn'tIt's the same impulse that leads to echo-chamber rejection of any other culturally scary ... well, anything.  The Good People Like Me in a safe camp with the warriors guarding us, and the Bad People outside worldview is probably genetically embedded, and it's behind a lot of this. Intelligent people's brains shut down when they're scared, too."
"Same with gun control slowing down crime to an extent. Maybe the petty criminals but anyone that would want a gun could get one I think the difference between encryption and guns is that with guns, not everybody wants to use them. Of those that do, not everyone is going to have the time and inclination to become competent in their use. They say that if you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns, but in many areas that becomes a near reality even without laws banning guns. Those that do tend to use them in crime, often crimes of passion."
"But with encryption, at the very least, every time you buy something on the Internet, you're using encryption. I can only imagine what other legitimate uses mandating backdoors would endanger.That doesn't mean you can't make it harder for people to get."
"I don't think you should halt or weaken encryption, but I don't think the then only the bad guys will have it argument is the best route."
"I think it's better to compare it to locks. People need locks for many reasons. Weakening locks would make the entire nation less secure.That's a really good analogy. Nobody'd be stupid enough to say We need to ban padlocks! It must be easier for law enforcement to get inside a criminal's house!, and yet that's exactly what an encryption ban is.They'd only insist that the government gets to have the master key, which also shouldn't happen.The issue is that locks can be broken with enough resources, while properly built encryption is totally secure regardless of the money you throw at the problem.Like those TSA locks?"
"Yeah, they are a master keyed system, and people have reverse engineered the TSA master keys because you can get a large enough sample at any hardware store.Are we talking about guns or encryption?Both. Trying to completely ban/outlaw guns is beyond retarded, same goes for encryption. The desire to outlaw them, and most other things for that matter, is based on irrational fears and boogeymen. Only violent criminals and nutjobs use guns! Civil people have no need for tools of destruction,  Only pedophiles and people who commit crimes want encryption! Civil people have nothing to hide!.I think after the fappening  the public would be more aware of the need for people other than terrorists and pedo's to use encryption. "
"I don't want it to be difficult for my doctor to adequately secure my records. [removed]Thoughtcrimes.They've tried that with drugs, guns, and many other things. They can't even keep them out of prisons. Banning objects works just as well as banning knowledge. I do find it somewhat ironic that this issue is important to the redditing community at large and therefore the same anti gun control message is used- which reddit is largely against. "
"Outlaw X and only criminals will have X. Works in so many cases and is probably the best emotional appeal for an issue.> Outlaw X and only criminals will have X. Works in so many cases "
"Works in all cases. "
"> is probably the best emotional appeal for an issue."
"No emotions; only facts and logic.I don't really agree that it's an emotional appeal. It seems like a logical appeal to me because it logically follows that criminals won't obey the law and such laws will only harm law-abiding people. The difference is that Reddit sees encryption as benefiting everyone, while Reddit sees guns as not benefiting everyone."
"I'm not here to argue about guns, but they're right about encryption.this is the first thing i thought of when i saw that headline. same argument about guns.is gun control a major issue among the American prison population?  No. But a few still find their way into inmate hands every year. "
"My point is that prison is literally the most controlled environment that most people could ever be exposed to in the US and they can't keep contraband out of the hands of the prisoners. Even if we all lived as prisoners, we would not be able to completely solve the problem and I don't think that anybody is willing to live their entire lives on lockdown. No but drugs are.The whole scenario really makes me think back to a book i read in high school called Harrison Bergeron. You can't control the idea of encryption since it is just math. It is like legislating stupidity.[Harrison Bergeron](http://www.tnellen.com/cybereng/harrison.html) is actually not a book, it's a short story by Kurt Vonnegut! You can draw a lot of parallels between this and [Export Grade Cryptography.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FREAK)It has been a long time since i was in high school. looks like i remembered it being a lot longer than it was.Especially when the thing that exists is just math.And in some form or another has been around for 1000s of years. The Romans used primitive encryption for their military communications. "
"Anyone that's suggesting banning encryption is a grade A moron. Any politicians doing should it be removed on account of mental disability. They're not fit to run a lemonade stand, much less a government.I have found that drugs are fairly effective in undiscovering math. I've found the opposite. Amphetamine has turned me into a math/programming boss.[removed]I'm a professional methematician, and this joke is soooooo old. (but that won't stop me from using it)Using what? Meth or math? Maybe both? But if you stop using math for  meth then how do you know if you're getting ripped off.When you get into the really complex stuff, ma/eth cease to be differentiable. Tried it once in high school. *MAN* was it ever trippy. Never again. I'm done with derivatives.The cynical part of me says that the government knows this already, and it's not the terrorists' data they're after. Terrorism just gives them a nice excuse to ban encryption so they can spy on all of us. Look into the history of communism over the past century and how the U.S. dealt with it. You get stuff like the Red Scare, Bay of Pigs, and DOZENS of Democratically-elected Communist governments. Basically, Terrorism is the new Communism and we've been fed a crock of shit for decades. People are still falling for it. The Military-Industrial complex is very real, it's not some conspiracy.You should append more easily, because that's the issue. Not whether they can, but the resources required.They do.  But if you make it so only terrorist can use encryption, legally, it sure does make it a lot easier to spot the terrorists!you mean the realistic, sensical, logical, and historically-referencing part of you? that part is smart. listen to it.> Terrorism just gives them a nice excuse to ban encryption so they can spy on all of us."
"If they ban encryption the entire banking industry will grind to a halt. It's required for communication and secure data storage.While I think so too, it's not right to think that way. It's like saying all terrorist are perfect and that they will never make a mistake. The more info the government has the more chance they have of catching a mistake. I don't agree with that but you're argument for it is not goodEveryone always assume conspiracies, but in honesty the best way to do bad things is to find **true believers** and then direct their outrage to benefit yourself."
"Kind of the entire background of organized religion being created.Exactly. They know full well this won't do shit to help against der turrists, what they're after is control. Full control over everyone."
"Politician up-and-coming that might rock the boat and upset corporation's profit-making ability? Well let's just dig up their browsing history and smear them with some kinky shit they looked at 5 years ago. Suddenly they're unelectable!/r/conspiracyNever waste a good tragedy.Im probably going to get shit on for saying this. But this is the same Exact principle to gun control. It's different, and the comparison is disingenuous. "
"For one thing, control implies regulations. I don't think anyone thinks there should be no regulations on guns or encryption. So this would only work if discussing a ban on encryption alongside a ban on guns. And that's not even close to the discussion on the table; it's always been about the degree of the regulations."
"More than that, all things equal, they aren't. Encryption is far more important to liberty than guns in the modern era. Guns are a method, one of many, of protecting yourself. Encryption is the only method of protecting digital information, and information is everything; it has every piece if meaningful data on everyone on the planet. It's the largest violation of freedom in history."
"And lastly, defiantly saying that gun bans would never work because guns already exist is foolish when you look at nations that DO have a ban on guns, have low crime, and 1/4 of the homicides the US has."
"I'm not arguing for a gun ban, but trying yo say it can never work is retarded when you consider it exists and it works.  You can say it's not for us; fair enough. But don't say it's an inherently flawed practice.But there is no regulations on encrypting. I could encrypt any data I want in couple minites.Im more interested in what the non-cynical part of you says?That they're really just that stupid. 'The government' or elected officials? The latter makes policy, and can be astonishingly clueless.Thought police, crime prevention.its a sad state of affairs when cynicism and realism are indistinguishable.> The cynical part of me says that..."
"I don't think you're being cynical at all, given the bills they're trying to pass and the businesses paying government to push these bills.There is nothing cynical about your line of thought. This is exactly the case. For Your Safety is the oldest line in the book.That's hardly cynical. There is no shortage of unambiguous evidence that this is exactly what government wants. I remember reading somewhere a while back that the NSA still bulk stores encrypted data they can't access and then they come back and crack it years later once they have the computing power/ability to do so.Unencrypted data from Americans is on a rolling deletion cycle. If they don't receive a warrant within 30 days (IIRC) it's flushed. "
"Encrypted data is stored indefinitely, but there are not attempts made to decrypt it (computationally infeasible) unless they receive a warrant. And even then it should be computationally infeasible to decrypt. That would be in no way unsurprising.meanwhile, if you ban real crypto, people will buy from someone who doesn't. the rest of the world is getting real tired of our shitEven more cynical:  They know there's nothing to find and don't give a shit, but expanding data collection expands contracts and budget."
"Ultimately government should be a way for me to legally redirect public money into my pocket.> expanding data collection expands contracts and budget"
"The main aim is and always has been financial gain, but not though bloating, try fraud. If you get wind of an upcoming windfall e.g. an oil company finding a new field then you can invest in the company *before* the knowledge becomes public. A form of insider trading for all extents and purposes. "
"There are also dozens of proven cases going back decades when these spy networks have been exposed as being used to steal technologies and to get an advantage in trade negotiations. The infamous 2001 EU Parliament report into ECHELON details them and that's what was known about 15 years ago!"
"All of this stuff *pre-dates* the fascination with the War on Terror by a long-shot. Economic espionage has traditionally been the primary function of spy networks. It would be naive to believe this has changed. Security theater is an incredibly lucrative business."
"The NSA's primary 'function' aside from that is economic espionage, as it also spies on foreign countries.And the TSA's primary function is as a federal jobs program.Give a man a fish, feed him for a day.  Give a man a TSA screening job and improve employment numbers for low-skilled labor! Can we just pay them to pick up litter on the side of the roads or something like that? I feel like that would improve the populace's lives much more than what we're currently paying them for.I say we pay them to make art. Paintings, music, dance, Youtube tv shows, whatever they might be good at.  At least there is some evidence that exposure to art reduces criminal behavior, unlike TSA searches.there is everything to find out. a complete record of everyones lives. the amount of money you can extract from this is infinite. insider information in every market, deep knowledge in human psychology. a complete sample size for advertisers. the possibilities are endless."
"then the pervs get all their sexts. "
"they arent doing it for no reason. no one does something for no reason.Ah, the Iron Law of Bureaucracy: An organisation will always put its interests ahead of its goals. And another top quote. This thread is a goldmineIt's the first thing I was taught in management 101: the primary goal of *anything*, including any group, is self-preservation.Some of the government might know this and are tricking the parts of government who don't know."
"Always assume your politicians are clueless and keep sending them knowledge whenever it looks like they're ignorant.UK's minister of internet security used to work in Google AND FacebookWhat particularly objectionable things has Joanna Shields been responsible for?The fact that there are so many documented examples of rogue agents conspiring to commit criminal acts within an agency using the agencies' resources demonstrates that this is possible and probably likely. "
"Just humans being humans. Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.Hmmm, where have I heard that before? Yet that's just not how reality works.A good quote, but more of a general observation than an actual rule. You honestly think the NSA, our fucking intelligence agency, is just straight up ignorant? Bullshit. This is not ignorance, this is control. Nobody in power wants an informed public. Let alone a public with the means to defend themselves. Yes, your normal day to day politicians might be clueless but not our intelligence agency. "
"Edit- I'm a dangus and flew right past the UK part but the point remains. Top people in power are not idiots or ignorant. They are well informed. "
"It's a big club....and YOU AIN'T IN IT!-George Carlin> You honestly think the NSA, our fucking intelligence agency, is just straight up ignorant? Bullshit. "
"The commenters above are not referring to the NSA, but to politicians in general. It was suggested that the most likely case is that a subset of people in government want to deliberately spy, and the rest of the politicians just thinks they're doing the right thing, as told by the smarter/more powerful people. The NSA was never mentioned.I still have a hard time believing that the majority of politicians are unaware of the ramifications of all this. They may be outta touch with some issues but not when it comes to the subject of power, influence, and control on a wide scale.[deleted]But blatant ignorance is intent.[removed]I'm on your side, but I think saying our lives are at stake is a little hyperbolic. Plus, that's the type of fear-mongering we're trying to combat."
"edit: In case it wasn't clear, I'm on your side. As in, I'm for encryption and think it's important for protecting privacy, which, again, I'm for.If someone stole my identity they could pretty much steal my life along with it.Many medical devices we use on a daily basis rely on encryption. If that encryption is compromised bad actors could potentially gain access to things like medicine pumps, heart monitors, and many other devices. Lives aren't always at stake, but it's hard to say compromising encryption doesn't at least make us less safe in life threatening situations."
"Source: work in healthcare information security.This, also every Tesla on the road as well as every piece of farming equipment and grid connected power station. If we open ourself up to low grade encryption we give ourselves to whomever wants to hack and take us over.I managed to convince my mostly computer illiterate grandparents by comparing encryption to bank vault."
"A strong encryption is the shinny 2 ft solid steel door with all the fancy lock on it at the bank down the street."
"A weak encryption is like the wooden front door of the house."
"No encryption is like the public park across the street from the bank."
"When you have sensitive or highly valuable stuff, do you keep it on the bench in the park, a closet in the house, or in a locked box in the bank's vault?"
"And now they believe encryption to be very important and the government is been stupid.I prefer a safe, an envelope and a postcard."
"A safe has a lock and a combination that can only be opened with the combination or a lot of effort. This is like strong encryption."
"An envelope is openable by the government if they want but there are rules saying when they can and can't do it. There's also very little protection against a criminal who gets into your  mailbox. This is like a government backdoor."
"A postcard is public and readable by anyone who can see it. It's not necessarily plastered on billboards but anyone who handles your mail can read it  easily. This is no encryption at all.Haha. Yes, that does sound like a closer analogy. It was spur of the moment, and we were just at the bank. So that's the only analogy I could thought of at the time."
"Oh well, it worked, so that's all that matters. :PYou could use an analogy with only a safe.  Imagine a super secure 2 feet thick steel safe with a high tech ultra secure unlocking mechanism that's unlocked by some sort of iris scanner or facial recognition technology.  The only persons that can access the safe are those authorised to be able to open it by the scanner.  However the safe also has a shitty traditional pin tumbler lock and master key that overides the high tech scanner so that the government can come along with their master key and check you're not keeping anything they disapprove of in the safe."
"So what happens when some nefarious person comes along and decides they want access to your safe?  They obviously cant abuse the scanner to gain authorisation without another authorised person present, so the only weak point of entry is the shitty traditional lock.  Being a knowledgeable person on how such locks work, they know that there are several methods of entry using just the vulnerabilities of the traditional pin tumbler lock.  They could try and find a way to obtain the master key, but that's unlikely to happen.  They could drill the lock open and try to gain access to the inside of the other locking mechanism but this may be too much of a brute force approach that damages the higher tech lock, but it might just work.  They could however learn to pick locks and simply open the lock with a simple lock picking set purchased from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/GOSO-Piece-Lock-Pick-Set/dp/B0079IKMX6).  Even locks that are designed to defeat lock pickers can be overcome by someone who who [reasonably practised at the art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI7Lx-73lU0).  Lastly, they could find out what sort of key is required to open the lock and then manufacture what is known as a bump key that will [open up any lock of its type without even having to know what the original key looked like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=131j0htYIoU).  "
"So yea, not only has the addition of a master key rendered the high tech lock useless, but its also given a way of entry to anyone with a bit of technical know how that doesn't even require access to the master key.That is way too much information and fancy high tech stuff for my grandparents. LOL. Years of dealing with them has taught me that - when it comes to technology, keep it simple, keep it something they can relate to.What If Apple would just stop selling their products in the UK in th event of an encryption ban?considering Apple products are popular in the UK and the UK is a major market for Apple i am guessing they won't.Who would win, in that situation? No one.I know that Apple is too greedy to lose on UKs worth of sales..."
"[But *if*.](http://i.imgur.com/SZAXMD7.jpg)That cash that Joker is burning in that picture is absolutely nothing compared to the cash that Apple could burn. "
"Apple has approximately $250 billion in cash. "
"Scale wise, that's roughly 2,000 pallets of cash. "
"They could lose UK sales for a couple years and be totally fine, they wouldn't even blink. Apple does have ~~millions~~ billions in cash to fall back to."
"And who wouldn't love to see some riots in London over no more iPhones?"
"But yeah, everyone does lose.206 Billion actually, but yea, they won't pull the product, but they might get creative about it.Apple. Riot different.This is truly the most innovative riot yet.It's beyond innovative. It's ... *revolutionary.*It would probably cause enough public backlash to get the government to reverse its decision.One election cycle is all it would take. The politicians who made the law would be booted from office. Politicians against the law would be voted it. The law would disappear. Apple could sell their phones again. Everyone wins.Except for the massive loss of sales by Apple, it's gonna hurt Apple a lot more than the UK and there's no certainty it would take one cycle, that's just your prediction."
"Edit: I'm just pointing out it's not as simple a decision as this looks, there is potential losses/gains no matter what direction they go unless certain political action is taken.I personally hope that if Apple has any respect for the privacy of its customers, they would stop selling the products, and release a statement as to why they came to this decision.http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2127048/Apple-6bn-UK--paid-10m-tax.html"
"This article indicates that about 10% of Apple's revenue comes from the UK. That is quite significant, but considering what a firm position Cook has taken on this issue I would not be surprised if Apple pulled out of the UK rather than backdoor their products. Pretty old article 3yrs~. I really doubt it's that high anymore because Apple has expanded to several more markets since (namely China). Accommodating the UK regulations would be expensive and potentially damaging to the security of their services in other regions (you can't remove end to end encryption from iMessage in just the UK). So I could definitely see it being more worthwhile for Apple to pull out of the UK to at least some extent. Think of all the good press and publicity they would get. Wouldn't they just disable iMessage in the UK? Seems to me that this would be the most reasonable thing to do. I truly hope this would happen - if only to see Cameron backpedalling like the clueless cunt he is.You wouldn't see that happening. He'll come out with some BS exception or something but he won't admit he was wrong in any way.Please don't disparage cunts by comparing them to David Cameron. They already have enough problems in this world to deal with, being cunts and all. Excuse me, I take offence it that word. Please use asterisks at least next time, like D\*\*\*d C\*\****n.Dhunter2d Chunter2nI know, so offensive."

The gov says they *need* to spy for their safety, and Tim is pointing out this isn't the case, and will only work against the average citizen.Tim knows that too. But he can't just say it that way. He's doing the best he can to retain our right to encryption. Good guy Tim CookWhat I really like is that Apple put a 'canary in the coal mine' with a statement on their webpage saying they have never surrendered data to a government agency (paraphrased). I believe the thought is that they aren't allowed to keep it unless it's true, and since they can't reveal a secret court order, they're giving a warning if they remove it. Quite a few websites do this, actually:"
"https://canarywatch.org/Tim Cook can and has been [saying it that way, to anyone who will listen](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/10/01/445026470/apple-ceo-tim-cook-privacy-is-a-fundamental-human-right):"
">I don't think you will hear the [National Security Agency] asking for a back door. ... There have been different conversations with the FBI, I think, over time. ... But my own view is everyone's coming around to some core tenets. And those core tenets are that encryption is a must in today's world."
">And I think everybody's coming around also to recognizing that any back door means a back door for bad guys as well as good guys. And so a back door is a nonstarter. It means we are all not safe. ... I don't support a back door for any government, ever.So this is why Tim Cook has been getting unwarranted sheit, all along? He doesn't want to get in line with backdooring and general security dismantling?I'm pretty confident that he's familiar with backdooringIt's funny because he's gay"
"Samsung's CEO is even more gay. And waterproofFor the record, anyone who doesn't use Apple products or has a Jihad against them: I've been able to format my Hard Drives using AES encryption for years, and when you reformat a drive it gives you three options in OS X.  Quick format which just writes over the old information, full format which writes 0s over every block on the hard drive before formatting it, and an extended format that will write random bits of data all over the hard drive and wipe it 7 times before formatting your drive.The formatting on osx is nice. When I sold my MacBook, I just picked the option to wipe three times because why not. Took 3 hours lol.The write 0 option is all you need. There has been ample research that it's impossible to recover data from a drive wiped like that.Actually, if that drive is encrypted and you erase the keys then all data will be no more then noise.True. How hard is it to brute force the keys? Serious question. I imagine the NSA has farms of systems designed specifically to brute form through encryption.Breaking it through brute force would be impossible, as in, the universe would undergo heat death before then even if you combined all of the computing power worldwide. Their only hope would be to discover and exploit a weakness in the encryption algorithm.> How hard is it to brute force the keys?"
"As shown above, even with a supercomputer, it would take 1 billion billion years to crack the 128-bit AES key using brute force attack. This is more than the age of the universe (13.75 billion years)"
"[Source](http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1279619)Don't forget, they can store your data and decrypt once quantum computing is viable. That might take a while, but when storing seriously incriminating stuff, this might be important.> Don't forget, they can store your data and decrypt once quantum computing is viable."
"AES is not vulnerable to quantum computers. Well, slightly, using something called Grover's algorithm, but doubling the key size will easily stop that.Quantum computers can't crack AES256, it remains strong even against Grover's algorithm For an encrypted hard drive, simply overwriting they key is sufficient. But 7 times man!then microwave it.  Thanks Mr. Robot.I accidentally chose this option when formatting a 300gb partition on an external hard drive. It took 14 hoursThat's the standard for many organizations and even the govt so I can see why Apple would support it. In reality a simple override with 0's is more than sufficient. Worked for a company that refurbished gov't/university computers for use in high school and elementary schools. "
"The gov't drives were often wiped once before sent to us and then we had to reformat them using the 7 write process. Took forever on mechanical hard drives.> Quick format which just writes over the old information, "
"Actually quick format just removes the directory entries that tell the drive that there's something there. The data is all still there, untouched. This is absolutely true, which is why I actually like the extended format options on OS X.  I usually just go for writing 0's because the extended format takes something like an entire day, but I totally appreciate having the option.I'm a linux sysadmin."
"Without strong encryption I have no idea how I'd do my work on a day to day basis."
"I'm pretty sure if the US outlaws encryption for everyone, then tons of companies will move to a country where it's legal."
"Are they going to outlaw it for personal use only and force everyone tech savvy to incorporate themselves? That's also silly.Don't be a pussy and just telnet.  Correct. And we have enough flaws in our security now. Weak encryption makes hack almost trivial. The government are the ones spying. The way this sentence is laid out, they are the bad people. What's the point in telling them this?Victim disarmament.If Apple really wants to get the message across, they should refuse to sell Apple products in the UK if they implement this. Make an example of them. When 60 million people can't get access to their precious iPhones, they'll start screaming at the government and the government will back down. And Apple can afford to forgo UK profits for a time.[removed]I've always thought of it like this."
"Trained robbers rarely bust down the front door. They get in through weaknesses in the building and surgically collect the cash, then get out as quietly as they entered."
"The government would rather bust down the front door and case the joint just to make sure you're not up to anything.The government would rather forbid you from having a door, actually.I will try a slightly different angle on why they want this. This is about being lazy. The government wants to leverage you against you when you do something bad. This is a nice way around the 5h amendment. "
"The FBI might be the front for this chatter on the hill but they are not the ones crying like babies. That is the DEA. The DEA had grown accustomed to wire tapping every one and any one they liked if they could even vaguely justify involvement in drug activity. These people hired IT people finally and no longer use standard level non-encryption to communicate.  They use end to end encrypted iMessages. This is why they are hell bent on bringing down iMessage. The DEA does not want to use human intelligence they just want to go back to the old way they worked which is skim and exploit you agains you. "
"This terror smoke screen is that a smoke screen. "
"I am now putting on my tin foil hat, and say once they have this massive data bank who is minding the shop so to speak. Once you have this data how will it be used if your not subject to a current investigation. This is where they invoke the secrets act. The end point is full history of you and when it suits them call it back up. This should be immensely scary to people.  You realize this is about the UK, not the US right?I am aware.  I am also aware that the UK could be a bell weather for where america wants to go. The Five Eyes arrangement makes it too likely that expanded surveillance powers in the UK -- where they already record *all* Internet traffic under Tempora -- can be used against Americans via intelligence sharing and parallel construction. Something scarier than the NSA is the NSA minus the Bill of Rights, and there is such a thing: GCHQ.Well that is trueAaaaaaaaaaamen.  "
"Organizations under the governments, like the CIA, FBI, NSA, already know this.  Our leaders are either naive or evil enough to believe it.  A-fucking-men. Laws are not there to stop the law breakers. Law breakers don't care about breaking the law."
"It's the UK government to be specific. They are not to be trustedInformation gathering is not to counter terrorism it is to get an advantage in economy. It has nothing to do with fighting terrorism Ten bucks says he won't apply that logic to guns.If you outlaw guns, then only outlaws will have guns."
"Well, duh.[If you outlaw encryption, only outlaws will have encryption.](https://xkcd.com/504/)It's pretty fucked up companies are trying to protect us from our governments. It should be the other way around.You can replace the word encryption with the second amendment and still have a true statement.   As a matter of fact, the first amendment would also be an appropriate substitute. Finally, something from Apple that I can get with! Apple CEO..."
"You mean Tim Cook?OP: He who shall not be named...How many people off the street would know who that is though? It's better to make it easier for people to recognize."
"Edit: AutocorrectTim Cook"
"You mean the CEO of Apple?Apple CEO..."
"You mean Tim Cook?Yes, the CEO of Apple is in position to be Tim cook."
"Wait a minute....WTF? Why am I seeing so many comments about gun control in here? It's not even remotely close to the same issue. If I owned a gun, there's no way a government or other entity could spy on me with it."
"As soon as we allow one person in through a back door, it means criminals can get through it to. There's no point in twisting that analogy to work with guns because computers can't kill people (unless it's a big server and falls in someone).Because the If you outlaw encryption only outlaws with have encryption is a verbatim argument against gun control if you replace encryption with guns. This argument is super common among gun control opponents.ITT: gun controlThis is EXACTLY the same argument that can be used ANYTIME a government wants to use to ban anything. If it has a good side and a bad side (which everything does) then someone in government wants to take it from the people. Bad people will be bad no matter what the government does. except in this case, the solution being proposed would do literally nothing to hurt criminals. they would simply not use algorithms that have a backdoor."
"for the average person, this is a nightmare scenario. breaking encryption is essentially a nation-wide enforcement of compromised internet connections for individuals and businesses. "
"on top of that, the government would have full plaintext access to all communication sent by any entity using a device in their jurisdiction."
"> Over the last 16 months, as I've debated this issue around the world, every single time somebody has said to me, I don't really worry about invasions of privacy because I don't have anything to hide. I always say the same thing to them. I get out a pen, I write down my email address. I say, Here's my email address. What I want you to do when you get home is email me the passwords to all of your email accounts, not just the nice, respectable work one in your name, but all of them, because I want to be able to just troll through what it is you're doing online, read what I want to read and publish whatever I find interesting. After all, if you're not a bad person, if you're doing nothing wrong, you should have nothing to hide. Not a single person has taken me up on that offer."
"Glenn Greenwald in Why privacy matters - TED Talk*drops iphone*when they talk about banning encryption what does it actually mean for someone who isn't computer savvy? Do they mean anyone can read my emails and messages etc?It basically means if you ever thought about starting a company that helps people who have had identity theft it's becoming a really good time to do it.so, then we all have to become criminals with the knowledge to encrypt our own phones. "
"we all go to jail>not enough jails and building them seems silly> everyone on lifetime house arrest>still go to work/school/hang out and live our lives because they still need people to turn the wheels and press the buttons, but under FULL surveillance>3 meals a day and full medical care provided at tax payer expenses>It's like requiring that everyone have no locks on their doors by law. Criminals will have clandestine locks installed and be safe. Law-abiding people will be in constant danger and have their homes trespassed into all the time by criminals.This is the same paradigm with the war on drugs."
"Simply outlawing and maybe adding stronger punishments does not give the government control more control. In fact it does the complete opposite. You lose control of what you are attempting to control.'Good people', have morals, morals are anti-government..100% true and accurate. If you halt something that is mostly used by good people, to protect themselves, the bad guys will still be able to hurt them."
"Sound familiar?"
"I was legitimately flabbergasted when I read this headline. I thought to myself....this is exactly the same point with law abiding gun owners.This is the same for gun laws.Could we not replace the word 'encryption' with 'firearms'?Exactly like gun laws.  Thank you for making a great parallel.  It's almost like the same argument with gun laws ... Take away guns from everyone then only the bad guys have them and not the good .Maybe Apple can put some funding into https://letsencrypt.org then. 2nd AmendmentThose who would give up essential liberty, to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety."
"-- Benjamin FranklinI think this can apply to weapons tooIsn't this the same argument with guns, drugs, and prostitution?Gun Control LogicI'm not really sure what this quote means.  it means anyone who is going to use encryption to evade the law will do so whether or not the encryption used is illegal."
"outlawing encryption or weakening it with backdoors severely hurts people who want to protect their personal identifying information when, for example, shopping online or accessing personal accounts from their mobile device. "
"compromised encryption can be exploited very easily for the benefit of hackers and identity thieves. in the security world, if an encryption scheme is  even suspected to be weak by some attack, it is essentially sworn off and replaced by a more secure algorithm. government-backdoor encryption is broken by design and is a joke in the security community. it's ludicrous that this is even being proposed let alone discussed in a serious manner.sounds like gun controlWhy does this sound like the anti-gun control argument?Same thing with gunsSounds like the argument for guns. Funny that we accept thus argument for encryption, but not gun control, especially with the advent of 3d printersSimilar argument to be made for overreaching gun control?[removed]Yes. Especially in the US as we already have 300,000,000 firearms in private hands. If you banned them tomorrow the criminals wouldn't turn theirs in and it would take probably 50 years to make a good dent in the illegal firearms. If you banned guns tomorrow, 99% of law-abiding people would also not turn them in.    > If you banned guns tomorrow, 99% of law-abiding people would also not turn them in.    "
"That's an oxymoron. I think it is understood to what I meant.  If you want to be technical, fine, 99% of law-abiding people would suddenly become criminals because they wouldn't turn them in.  Shouldn't the second amendment apply to encryption? Has anyone tried to make this argument in court? It doesn't seem like such a stretch of logic, if you think about it.I think the 1st Amendment is all we really need to defend encryption. The founders even used encryption when they sent letters (hiding messages in code). "
"You can't ban speech except in cases where it endangers others like screaming fire in a crowded theater or telling everyone to kill such and such (ex. Hate speech). Encryption by itself is neutral. It would be like trying to ban a language just because only a few people can read it.  "
"The only reason encryption used to be restricted was because it was classified as weaponry/state secrets and the 1st Amendment doesn't give people the right to endanger the nation by exporting/selling state secrets. However that argument is dead since everyone has encryption now. Restricting big companies from including high-end encryption for their customers doesn't change the fact that they can get it elsewhere. "
"Terrorists don't need iMessage and I doubt they trust it anyways. When they are building bombs or buying weapons do you really think they aren't buying military grade encryption? "
"> A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."
"Arms seem pretty ambiguous so maybe. But then again, that could also mean background checks for the use of encryption, just like people want background checks for the use of guns. Or maybe, just like you may need a permit to carry guns, you may need a permit to use encryption.It definitely seems like a huge stretch of logic. The second amendment deals with a completely different subject matter. Both encryption and arms are tools to fight tyranny. I think it's a valid comparison. I guess the logical step is akin to how patenting something people do every day in the physical world, but on the internet is absurd. So why do we draw a distinction between being armed in the physical world, vs arming oneself on the internet?[removed]The 1st Amendment and 4th Amendment seem to apply much more clearly here."
"1st -- no abridging the freedom of speech -- i.e. I can send you encrypted code, or whatever else I want."
"4th -- No unreasonable searches and seizures -- i.e. privacy against their reviewing my communication for code/content they don't like.I've never thought of it like this. Have an upvote No. It cannot; they are different entities with different uses with different reasons for existing with different abuses."
"It's like comparing oranges and rocks.[removed]There are similarities in the argument, but no similarities behind WHY you would make that argument, nor the objects being argued about."
"It's like saying training your dog to pee outside makes life easier, so you should train your kid to pee outside.> There are similarities in the argument"
"Isn't that literally what the person you were responding to was saying? Exactly, came here for this.  The only caveat is that if your kid accidentally gets your encryption keys he's not likely to kill himself. [removed]Many gun deaths are due to previously law abiding citizens. The kind of people who would not own an illegal firearm. Things like accidental death and 2nd degree murder (no premeditation, just anger). That being said, I'm against banning guns altogether. Waiting periods and background checks do save lives. Also, buying a gun on the black market is not as easy as the NRA would have you believe. It's also much harder for a 5 year old to understand encryption than it is to shoot somebodyWhich is a huge difference, so its not really the same argument at all when any sort of context is included.But that's the point: the authorities want to track the good people. They have other methods for tracking bad people -- they always have, back when encryption meant secret book codes and dead-drops. It's called espionage, and governments are very good at it."
"But they want to control the masses, and the best way to do that is make sure they (the masses) know that the government knows (or will find out) all their dirty little secrets.ITT: a gun control debate in /r/technologyMy thoughts exactly: when encryption is outlawed only the outlaws will have encryption!Why are we still buying into this terrorism argument? It's just a stupid talking point. This is about the average person and collecting their money. Government is strangling us with taxes and crippling the world economy to save their asses.  THIS IS ABOUT YOUR DATA AND HOW THAT DATA CAN BE USED TO CONTROL YOU AND YOUR MONEY. FYI public officials: If you're not smart enough to understand why weakening encryption is a very bad thing, you shouldn't be making decisions for the public interest. Think of Apple what you will, but come privacy these guys are on top compared to other major tech companies. The ol' gun control argument.Surprise! It was never about the bad people.This is pretty similar to part of the pro gun argument actually.The idea that stopping encryption helps catch criminals is ridiculous, any serious criminals will buy encryption packages if necessary.  "
"The war on data is like the war on drugs. Currently a massive waste of time and money.Apple CEO: I'll say whatever it takes to sell more product. I'm an Apple fan, btw.That's no doubt the whole point. "
"Spying on the average citizen is no doubt far more important to these agencies who want to weaken it than spying on the tiny amount of terrorists and the like out there. "
"The likelihood of anyone in an industrialized nation being a victim of terrorism violence is so low that it barely exists. "
"In the USA, in the past several years combined the amount of people dead from terrorist violence just barely ekes into double digits, as in somewhere between 10 and 20 depending on how you count and what you include as terrorism. Basically none of it was Muslim terrorism, which seems to be the bogey man du jour."
"Meanwhile, tens of thousands have died in traffic, 8500 people have been murdered with guns in non-terrorism involved ways, and millions have perished from preventable illnesses and the like. Terrorism barely registers on the chart."
"For that, people should give up their civil liberties and right to privacy?"
"Seriously?Ah, Apple CEO, you are so adorable."
"It's not to go after whatever excuse they can come up with. It's to acquire and maintain power by doing things like illegally monitor those communications through the ministries that have no supervision (i.e. defense industries) for the interests of those who govern so that they can keep on governing. It is so naively egocentric that they would seriously jeopardize the security of their telecommunication services because of it."
"The law is not for everyone. I though that myth had been debunked some time ago. It is a high ceiling that gives a house advantage to the established few and maintains order between equals.Were going to ban use of the letter 'e' while were at it.People that are always watching you can't be trusted. They're not doing anything useful and present only risk. Increased risk increases anxiety, unease. Increasing anxiety and increasing population density can yield only one outcome.Look fellow gun owners--another double standard!Computers weren't designed to kill people though....Same exact logic applies to gun control. NRA has being saying that for years. So if we ban guns the good people will be the only ones that are affected? hmmm...EXACTLY the same reason DRM is bad.I am all in favor of pervasive encryption but this is a silly argument.  Most crimes are poorly planned if they are planned at all, and there is a good chance the the cops will find something on the suspects phone which will aid the investigation / prosecution.  We're not talking about terrorist masterminds, we're talking about some guy who texts his buddies about how he's going to kill his ex's dog, and then goes and does it.u can't hack me, I got Norton!!http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nKf2KtXnhB8/Uqfif1t8tBI/AAAAAAAABBs/nyIWLXCBXCA/s1600/hackers-gif-preparing-to-hack.gifApple is talking to the people, not the NSA and the rest of the government.  The government already knows this because the specific reason they want this is to spy on Americans, not terrorists.Welcome to the gun argument. "
"If you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns. Sounds exactly like the argument for guns. Just as valid too.Funny. This argument being used for phones and surveillance when it is a strong argument against overarching gun control laws and often dismissed.I wish this logic would be applied to gun control. Is he talking about encryption? Or gun control?It's the same thing with gun control^^this, but unfortunately I believe the stereotype demographic that would own a Mac would probably disagree with you. Not all of those, mind you, just the stereotype. I'm glad you see my point. Yea the typical stereotype wouldn't agree that's for sure. It's an interesting concept I like to think about. It's the difference between a good idea in theory and a good idea in practice. In theory, you have a problem. Either gun violence or criminals/terrorists being able to encrypt communications. How can we solve this? Oh by putting backdoors into encryption or by saying concealed carry for lawful citizens isn't allowed and all high capacity rifles should be limited to 10 rounds and have a fixed magazine. In practice this is horrible. A terrorist or criminal will find the encryption without a backdoor. Same thing for someone wanting to kill a bunch of people with a gun. So you say they can only have ten rounds and the magazine needs to be fixed? They can still quickly kill ten people. Not to mention the fact that guns and gun hardware is available anywhere. Someone looking to kill many people isn't exactly going to follow gun laws. They will just order that pmag 30 online. "
"It's ridiculous that people think outlawing or disallowing certain things that are readily available will prevent people that have already chosen to break the law from getting those things. Especially gun control. There are millions of gun owners in this country. Even more guns. By suddenly trying to control them out outlawing therm you are only putting law abiding citizens in danger. So lawful people will listen. But that guy mugging people doesn't give a shit. They will likely be even more capable to get a gun because where are all the guns people owned that are now illegal?This same argument can be applied to gun control.So kinda like gun laws? If you outlaw guns for the good law abiding citizen then only then bad unlawful people will have guns.This is a great analogy."
"Encryption : protection of data :: guns : protection from terrible people.This is essentially the same argument many make on gun control..."
"Gun laws only affect law abiding citizens because the bad guys are already cool with breaking the law.correct"
"the differences are many, however."
"everyone uses encryption in their daily lives, whether or not they know it. they only reason a guy sitting in grand central/times square with a wifi sniffer can't collect millions of credit card number is because of encrypted network connections. weakening the encryption used on these networks would be a serious attack vector that would make everyone vulnerable to these attackers."
"additionally, there is a significant gap between the average gun criminal vs the average cyber criminal. anyone using encryption in a nefarious manner is smart enough to simply not use government-broken encryption. so the ban is essentially worthless."
"people who acquire guns for nefarious purposes do not need any exceptional skill or knowledge to do harm with them, but acquiring an illegal firearm is an actual challenge that may dissuade the average dumb criminal. Except the facts simply don't support that statement. The vast majority of crime guns come from straw purchases/illegal transfers and theft. The laws on the books prohibiting straw purchasing and thefts haven't done a thing to stop these illegal gun transfers. I struggle to see how adding more words to a piece of paper will do anything to dissuade criminals...i agree with the overall argument that gun control is worthless and mostly ineffective"
"however i wouldn't agree that banning encryption is in the same league with strict gun control. i would venture to bet that at least one gun crime has been avoided simply by virtue of guns not being readily available by a would-be criminal. however, exactly zero criminals who use encryption would be stopped by a ban on encryption. a gun is physical equipment while encryption is something that can be searched for and downloaded within seconds.So wait, conservatives use this argument for gun rights and get ridiculed by liberals for being naive, but liberals can use it use it for internet privacy rights and its justified?Kinda like gunsThis could be a quote against gun control"
"The same logic applies to owning firearms, drugs, our rights, etc...I think this a conservative gun control argument applied to a different technology. If you outlaw guns, only law abiding citizens will stop buying them. ITT: every controversial comment is about gun control Just like guns. They know this, and going after the bad guys is not their true agenda. These same people don't understand this argument for more restrictive gun laws...Same can be said for strict gun control. Making it harder for a law-abiding citizen to purchase a gun does nothing to stop criminals.It definitely does.Well, just about every single other country in the world handily disproves that notion. Well, I might not quite agree, but I'm afraid to open up that whole can of worms."
"> Making it harder for a law-abiding citizen to purchase a gun does nothing to stop criminals."
"Have the lax gun laws made it easier to stop criminals?It allows more citizens to defend themselves; yes.Yes, which is why we need more conceal carriers.This same argument applies to gun control. It has been, is, and always will be about those in control retaining their control. There is a reason why there is a trope about hackers being the ones to free society from the bonds of government. This is strangely like that argument about banning guns to stop criminals.Funny, I use this argument to argue against gun control and get told that's totes not the same thing.Says the CEO of the company that ships a known-compromised version of OoenSSH in its latest OS and hasn't updated it.If you're talking about the SSH default keys, iOS doesn't ship with a vulnerability. Rooted iOS devices have it. Very logical. Sounds a bit familiar though, oh yeah, it's the same reason to not get stupid with gun control. Let's all clap and applaud Tim Cook for supporting public interests in privacy and then be totally surprised and outraged when it is eventually found out that Apple has been sharing our personal information with the NSASame thing with gun control and drugs.This is the exact same argument against more gun control."
"More gun control means you hurt the people who are law-abiding as the bad people already break existing laws and obtain their guns illegally. Except that you can't shoot somebody in the face with encryption.yeah but your kid can't accidentally encrypt himself in the head with the key you forgot to lock in a vault.funny - same could be said for gun controlWe have seen this exact law making philosophy when it comes to gun laws.  They don't care that they are only hurting the good people, that's the entire point of the legislation...His name is Tim Cook. Just like gun control!Isn't this the same reasoning people use to defend gun rights?  It seems to me you could replace 'encryption' with 'gun rights' and it would read the same.  I don't think this says anything about either issue, but I think it does say something about this argument, like, maybe it isn't all that sound.NRA or Apple. Sounds like the same argument.Yet whenever we apply this same logic to guns, reddit freaks out.Amusingly this is PRECISELY the same argument that Pro-2A folks use in regards to firearms!That's funny, this argument sounds similar to the one against gun control. Same argument regarding gun control. The other people know where to go: away from proprietary systems and companies which can be strongarmed by fascist governments like UK."

"It's so dumb and easy to see through that I really think anyone that actually buys it should be banned from ever voting again.What?  If you stop making it harder to do things, the good people will lose out as the bad ones already taught themselves to do the slightly harder things.  "
"...what?Ehh its all useless when the IT Vendors all allow backdoors for the NSA anyway.I love the fact that Apple is so strong on its stance when it comes to this matter. I really hope whatever comes next doesn't shake them from current their business policies. Working in the IT field for over 10 yrs. I can attest to that statement. I like the way he's ELI5-ing this one. "
"Bad things, good people. etc."
"This is the sort of thing we need, because governments will try to spin us out of our freedoms *democratically* by getting the ignorant to vote for bullshit.I love how everyone in here is so supportive of this statement but wont even look at the same argument for firearms.  In addition to that, banning encryption violates our right to free speech.I may be stupid to ask this but whats the long term plan. Whats their plan with motive with all this data what do you think they will do with the information?Not true at all. Many criminals use extremely unsophisticated methods to commit crimes...Oh yes, I'm sure the government wants to weaken encryption because it will help the good people in the long run. They're just misinformed, that's all! Give them the right information and you can bet they'll do the right thing! Honestly, I think that they can read encrypted data. Yeah, well, duh."
"If you remove your front door, it's not the burglars you hurt, but the people who live there."
"DEEP.Guys."
"Why is this a controversy?"
"Encrypted data is a fact of life. Federal and State laws will have to change to accommodate some hypothetical no more encryption political movement, one example being HIPPA. We effectively wouldn't be allowed to have electronic versions of patient data, which means no online/automated health-care services or health-care related services PERIOD."
"Also, encryption is merely a mathematical masking of data. Like, how can you be against that without being against things like compression algorithms. And who among us wants to outlaw 7zip?"
"To the informed, this issue is just non-sensical. Just a small point: the concept of digital backdoors has been around since way, waaay before Snowden..Thank you for that seriously obvious statementMight as well require all mail to be written on post cards as well. Federally implemented back doors are the same as someone telling you to leave your bedroom window unlocked. Stating, it's ok, we're the only ones who know about it.Honestly I have no problem for the government to spy on my internet/email/phone calls as long as they stop putting shit in my food and water and the air I breath....I find, that somehow, people who agree with this argument, tend to discount the analogous one for guns.Yes, so now allow there to be a GPGTools for iOS.This argument sounds familiar. Reminds me of the situation with immigration laws in the U.SWhy do we have to dumb down the argument to this level? Aren't the government helped by brilliant enough advisors?Encryption is a tool that ups an arms war of encryption/decryption. It can be used for good and bad. Not sure how having an unbreakable lock is somehow more good than bad or more bad than good at all.There are already end-to-end encryption services available for text messaging and VOIP. So how do they expect to halt or weaken these services? In those cases the only people who can decrypt the signals are the sender and the recipient.It's OK Apple, I've stepped my security up, Decoder Ring! Makes a bunch of sense doesn't it?"
"What benefit would the government get if they implemented wide spread monitoring? "
"They wouldn't catch the bad guys, they know how to get around."
"But direct advertising is pretty good reason eh? They know what you want so they give you ads for that stuff.this feels oddly similar to many things that are said in the debate on gun violence (not that i am for the people who want to put guns in every classroom or anything like that)I can't believe people are even *considering* outlawing encryption. I know lawmakers are dumb, but I didn't know they were *that* dumb...Silicon Valley should form its own country, or buy California and [secede from the union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secession_in_the_United_States). The tax benefits alone would be worth it. Slowly it could buy up other cash-strapped states, offering free education programs that fin in with an overall corporate agenda - giving rise to a new generation of scientists, leaders, and designers. As the old American Union slowly fades into obscurity, world peace will start to have a real chance.I see the echo chamber is still functioning.Typical politicians... If we make a law against something people will stop using it"
"We should outlaw cocaine. Oh wait....i.e. You have nothing to fear if you have nothing to hide.Unfortunately people don't feel that same way about guns yea, thats the point, retard - FBIIt's less about terrorism and more about affairs and strange porn. Im david cameron and I want to ban copy/paste in favour of sticking my penis is a pigs mouth please? See also: LawsSo Apple makes the 2nd Amendment / NRA argument and everyone is with them?Its true the FBI knows it too. The deep web is quite the place As someone going into network administration, I fear what this will cause if anything is passed to weaken encryption. So in other words the exact people who are being targeted....."
"Working as intended.I know he's not Steve Jobs, but I'm sure we'll all know who you are talking about if you say Tim Cook, lol.Quoting my network prof back in college:"
">For every lock, there is always a keyJesus Christ... Man in the middle attacks take zero effort if nothing is hidden!For once it isn't US politicians doing something stupid. Although I'm sure they're thinking the same thing. Been saying this about crackers DRM and piracy for years, exact same thing only people you hurt with draconian methods is the clean folks, anyone doing anything shady is generally going to be skilled enough that they can bypass your measuresEat shit GCHQ - I'm in Canada now!The thing is, there's no actual way to tell what he thinks."
"This is just the most profitable thing to say right now. He might mean it, or he might be saying it because he thinks it'll be a popular thing to say.Hate on Apple all you want, at least they're taking this stand.Which is of no concern to the people who want this. In fact, its almost certainly the entire motivation behind it.I've been saying for years that encryption, network security suites and certain types of hacking scripts should have 2nd Amendment protections. just be like FINE, NO MORE COMPUTERS THEN"
"After reading the article for the first time I am considering using Apple devices. So impressed.Wait, is this about actual computers, or a subtle metaphor from anti-gun control enthusiasts?He is absolutely right.Politicians don't care. They are paid but care. After all they are taught that they know better than everybody else.Wow - Tim Cook being smart.  Weird.First sense out of his mouthWow finally something useful from Apple. I didn't read every comment, but the overwhelming majority of the people in this thread have no fucking clue how this works."
"Data being secure and that secure data being untraceable by the government are sooooo different.What's the point behind weakening encryption? To make it easier to crack the encryption? A fucking no brainer. Might as well not encrypt at all. Could well make it to a modern-day Monty Python skit.Is it just me or does there seem to be a lot of similar rhetorical motifs between gun control and encryption policy?This logic could applied elsewhere also. Like on gun control.Only good guys with encryption can stop bad guys with encryption.This is my argument against gun controlSounds like the NRA but what do I know.If you make your devices closed source, the people you hurt are not the folks that want to do bad things. It's the good people. The other people know where to go.The exact same logic applies to citizen disarmament.This is why Tim Cook rocks. It's the same dumb government logic as gun control. Cook is a proud NRA member btw. Gates is a OBAMA loving hippy. Source? I don't know what Cook's specific stance on gun control is, but regardless of that I doubt you could really call him a conservative.You don't have to be a conservative to have a logical/non-fear based stance on firearms.No, but the rest of your comment seems like it is trying to portray him as more conservative than he is."
"I would still be interested in a source on him being a proud NRA member. I haven't been able to find anything googling around for it.Is this satire or can you come up with a source for Tim Cook being a member of the NRA?He assumes that the government isn't one of the 'other people'.No he's not. He's just being careful how he's framing the whole thing. He's not stupid. Perhaps. Maybe this would be better:"
"His statement implies or suggests that the government isn't one of the 'other people'.It sounds like he was telling a room full of 5-year-olds.All criminals are technologically sophisticated and all noncriminals are not."
"Simply not true.I remember years ago when I, as well as many others, looked at Apple as the epitome of evil corporation. Now that's quite far from the truth. I really respect most of what they've done in the past few years and the way they shaped their corporate culture is huge.If banning encryption will help keep bad people from doing bad things, shouldn't banning guns do it as well? Hell, why not just throw everyone in prison, because they just 'might' do something illegal at some point in their life.Hahahaha. Apple CEO doesn't have a name. Where is Google on this issue?Thanks for not circlejerking about apple.isn't that what they say about guns? In Australia, after a minor incident all guns are taken by the government and VERY few gun misuse and accidents are found. though I can't attest to the violence (sexual assault, battery, ...) being reduced."
"Though the transport of guns can be easily caught as Australia is a continent far far away separated by vast ocean. In America, it might be downright impossible. Where are guns manufactured and assembled anyway?I can build a gun in my garage in a weekend. 3D printing is a bitch"
"Strange. This is the same argument used by 2nd amendment rightists.Don't Apple and Google already have backdoors in their phones?Same argument for gun control. Apple only is interested in protecting rich people.  Can't have people of more-than-modest means being inconvenienced by being hacked."
"Exhibit A: The Fappening.  "
"Exhibit B: Their release of a crypto library that doesn't work.Wait, wait, wait, did someone from Apple say something totally correct?"
"To everyone that doesn't know how often you use encryption, everytime you see a https:// instead of http:// you're using encryption. You need strong encryption, because the bad people might want your info and with poor encryption and backdoors they are likely to get it, and then it doesn't help you at all that the government have the same info as the bad people."
"Also there are already really strong encryptions out there that the bad people probably already use, so a weak encryption only really hurts you.Great argument. Same argument for guns and bitcoin... and... everything."
"Same concept for gun ownership.This is the same argument against gun control. Imagine if the same logic was applied to gun ownership.Or RPG ownership, or tank ownership, or artillery ownership, or ICBM ownership...Private citizens actually do own those things... Although I'm not sure where one would buy an ICBM but the others aren't difficult to come by legally.You are being sarcastic but I don't think you realize almost no weapon is banned in the US. Just heavily heavily restricted when you get past weapons the typical man could carry.Outlaw both PGP and RPG!!!!! /sSo by your logic, you, a regular citizen, only need 8 bit encryption. Only the government should have the best encryption, because they are the only ones that can be trusted with it.I'm glad you now see how ridiculous it is to try and compare weapon ownership to privacy rights.  I wouldn't say it's ridiculous at all. The government has no business in what weapons I own, or what encryption I use.Privacy and guns are totally different.They are not mutually exclusive.  The 2nd protects the other rights.  The bill of rights is an enumeration of basic human rights, it's not a ranking of importance.What makes them different?Privacy is the the ability to think or perform acts in a setting or situation where information about these thoughts or events are inaccessible to others. "
"A gun is a device designed to hold,  and trigger,  a chemically,  electrically,  air,  or otherwise propelled projectile, at a remote target. "
"I already understand the technical differences, although I appreciate your response. I should have been more clear with my question. When it comes to government control of citizen activity, what makes gun ownership or use of encryption different? Why can this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/3sa38d/apple_ceo_if_you_halt_or_weaken_encryption_the/cwvdz94) get up voted, but some one applying the same reason get down voted?And yet both are considered basic human rights in the United States.I bet he hates gunsHe's from Alabama, so that's a big bet...Translation: I am saying this because it makes my company look great and the competition look like assholes. They can profit from your information and we don't. We profit using huge markups so we'll tell you that your privacy matters... unless we ever decide to make money off of your information. Then, we'll pull the fastest 180 in the history of anything. Oh, the government already has ways to get your info. We couldn't do business in the US if we actually blocked them.Says the company that uses slave labor, bloody minerals, and dodges all taxes."
"They are bad people, they just like to pretend otherwise.Dumb dumb here. What's encryption? "
"Edit: I'll Google it, but if anyone wants to tell me anyways I'll be forever grateful."
"Edit 2: Googled it and still lost. :/Encryption is used to secure information, often when sent to someone. If you want so send hello to someone and encrypt it, an algorithm will transform it so something like iwjqkiwnamk so that no one can see the content of your message during delivery. Only the recipient will have the counterpart to your encryption (like a key) to see what you originally sended. It's an important part of data security today and necessary to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks (systems that sniff in networks to get passwords out of the sent data)"
"If the government would force devices to have a backdoor, like a master key for the government to decrypt the data, they would be adding a severe security hole to the device, helping attackers to get your data. It's dangerous and stupid to go against encryption, since it's already hard to prevent hackers from trying to breach into your servers as a company.Its funny how this argument is invalid when it comes go drugs or guns. yeah, the government already knows where to go if they want to fuck over apple users"
"the engineers/programmers you hired, tim cookI know this is pithy and it's going to be front page material regardless of the facts but it's not actually true. I work in law enforcement and your average criminal isn't moriarty or even the villain in a typical law and order episode. I quite regularly find troves of incriminating evidence that they are carrying around for no reason at all. I once had a girl with a netbook who had an excel spreadsheet accounting for her cocaine sales saved to the front page without securing windows with any kind of password. Encryption saves these felons from their own stupidity. "
"In other words: *If I look hard enough, I can find something to charge anyone with, please let me look at all their stuff so I can charge everyone*No in other words if criminals were already encrypting their info then law enforcement wouldn't care since the evidence was already beyond reach. Reddit has this misperception that if it's common knowledge within the hive mind then it is common knowledge within society at large. It just isn't true. Most criminals talk to cops even after their Miranda warning. People give permission for searches all the time. Even when they are hiding contraband. "
"If the average criminal was smart enough to take sensible precautions he wouldn't be a criminal. The average criminal isn't encrypting, so banning encryption is a good idea......"
"Just because some people give up their rights willingly, doesn't mean you get to take them away from everyone.That's not what I said. There are very valid privacy concerns especially with so much data being stolen by online criminals. But this statement linked by the op is incorrect. > statement linked by the op is incorrect."
"The statement isn't about innocent people being arrested, it's about hurt. There are many ways that breaking encryption comes back to hurt the very people government is said to represent. From economic impacts, to social, and onwards."
"Who cares about criminals stealing data when the government is stealing so much more data as to make criminal efforts appear comicalCould you provide a link for more info on that case? It sounds like you're exemplifying small scale incidents to support a decision of societal scale. Who wants to talk? ;)"

"-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----Well that was annoying. The problem is of course authenticity :)The circlejerk is strong here on Reddit. How about a more nuanced, realistic take: Encryption has both good and bad consequences, as does government surveillance."
"I'll take my downvotes right here, tyvm.Since when did Apple Care about common folk?[deleted]> Until Apple goes open source they cannot be trusted no matter what they say."
"You'll be down voted to hell, but your right.Their programming language Swift is open source, among what others have said."
"Anyway, they'll probably open source OS X and iOS as soon as Microsoft open sources Windows and Windows Phone OS. Which is to say never.Based on your comments here the best thing I can suggest for you is to not use any technology. I don't know what you do on your computer that makes you so paranoidYour downvotes confirm it. Apple. You will die a slow and beautiful death. You used to be good. And then you turned that gold into shit. That is some accomplishment. You can't seriously be suggesting that the largest computer company open source everything. That makes no business sense at all. No company would do that. Companies open source things that they don't mind competitors having.opensource.apple.comTheir OS kernels have been open-sourced from the get-go, and they recently open sourced their crypto library."
"https://developer.apple.com/cryptography/That's right. Hate on one of the few companies that's publicly opposing this fucking insanity. That will make things turn out right! Step 1: Be Apple CEO  "
"Step 2: Say Something obvious  "
"Step 3:???  "
"Step 4: random person gets karma.  It's hard to believe Tim Cook could be so naive. Attempts to weaken encryption are part of a strategy for eventual political profiling so that this society of the rich can identify and detain people who oppose their agenda.Yes, created by the illuminati. Maybe, just maybe, his message was to the public, not to the people who know this. You can be sure that anybody who uses the word folks in a public forum is a sociopath.Built in back doors at hardware level in processors? if an apple ceo said you put 1 and 1 together and you get 2, someone would be highlighting this quote as a notable observation from the apple ceo.Apple not being evil? What? "
"Serious propsSame thing with the second amendment right to keep and bear arms."
"I am surprised that it took liberals this long to figure it out finally. Actually, it's funny you say that.  There's a rare but horrible virus that I've run across while fixing people's computers."
"Basically, it infects through an innocuous file and encrypts every single data file in your OS in 2048 bit asynchronous encryption.  Then, it says that it will delete the encryption key if you don't pay them $500 or $1000 in bitcoins within 6-12 months of infection.  It provides instructions on how to purchase bitcoins, how to pay them, and how to use TOR in case their site is blocked."
"So amusingly, his statement is not completely true.  Encryption is already absurdly strong as-is.  Honestly, there's not much you can do to actively weaken it.  2048 asynchronous can encrypt 1 GB/s under virtually unbreakable encryption.  Is there even a point in entertaining the notion that it could be weakened or broken in some way without the public key?  Brute forcing the key would take millions of years lol.  At that point, the only weakness of encryption is the human element.Except even if us non bad actors don't have that level of encryption, the bad guys will still find it because *somebody somewhere* will ignore the laws and create stronger encryption. So your entire scenario doesn't even play out any differently.I fail to believe he really gives a shit given that Apple work for the intelligence servicesPlease, please don't downvote me because I do believe privacy is very important and shouldn't be compromised. But I cannot be a hypocrite and accept this reasoning because it's the exact same logic that gun nuts use to argue for looser gun laws. Banning guns hurts the good guys because the bad guys will still know where to go to get them anyways.the differences in these arguments are many"
"not everyone uses a gun in their daily lives. in fact, 99% of people do not. however, everyone uses encryption in their daily lives, whether or not they know it. they only reason a guy sitting in grand central/times square with a wifi sniffer can't collect millions of credit card number is because of encrypted network connections. weakening the encryption used on these networks would be a serious attack vector that would make everyone vulnerable to these attackers."
"additionally, there is a significant skill gap between the average gun criminal vs the average cyber criminal. anyone using encryption in a nefarious manner is smart enough to simply not use government-broken encryption. so the ban is essentially worthless."
"people who acquire guns for nefarious purposes do not need any exceptional skill or knowledge to do harm with them, but acquiring an illegal firearm is an actual challenge that may dissuade the average dumb criminal.Well you can argue that banning guns still makes it harder for gun nuts to obtain guns. And for guns, it's not just 'bad guys' who are the problem. A lot of accidents are caused by innocents owning guns, police carrying guns, kids taking guns to school, mentally ill people; these people are not in the category of 'terrorists', they are not necessarily the people would still know where to get a gun."
"The same is not true for privacy. Encryption is extremely easy, banning it makes no ounce of difference to the difficulty of encrypting messages for those 'bad guys'. > But I cannot be a hypocrite and accept this reasoning because it's the exact same logic that gun nuts use"
"So you don't agree with it because it sounds similar to an argument about another completely unrelated topic? That's some terrible logicIt's really not, if an argument isn't valid, it isn't valid. Context is irrelevant in socratic method.What an incredible generalisation So what reasoning do you use to stop the government from abusing its power?That's kinda the point.  When everyone uses PGP, it's really hard to sift through all that info and find the bad guys.  If only criminals use PGP, then you just find PGP users and you know you're going to find something in their ranks quickly and efficiently.If Encryption is removed from the face of the earth then what happens to those emails sent from the US to China that negotiate a way to crush the Russian economy forcing them to beg the US for help?  "
"That email is now free for anyone and everyone to read.  "
"How about those communications which could be so secret hidden from the public for years and years which has now been stolen by some 14 year old hacktivist proving that Bush ordered Bin Laden to blow up the towers then thought shit we need someone to blame and cover my ass... Saddam/Osama did it!.  "
"I hope the government understands that if they remove encryption all their stuff could effectively be laid bare to the public and any other nation intent on digging up some secrets to force politicians  in to bend over backwards to help avoid tax etc...  "
"Ask yourselves this? Are you fully prepaid to disclose every last moment of your life online? Are you willing to show that saucy text you just sent your wife to the public?  "
"Well thanks for the downvote. Maybe explain why?Theres already backdoors in Apple products just for the NSA. "
"Call it *conspiracy* until the next Ed Snow if you want.  Prove it? You're saying the NSA can break AES? No there aren't. And how exactly would you know?They aren't *direct* backdoors made specifically or in conjunction with the NSA. But just like MS, they often leave known vulnerabilities in their software, and share that information so that they can put their hands up in the air should something come back around. This is what we call the 3 way hand shake. it's funny that is's the apple CEO who's saying this."
"since apple product are known for their good security.If that's sarcasm, they actually are pretty good with security.Its crazy how people think encryption protects them, the NSA controls so many nodes they can middleman any password they want no problemo.How?? What good people need encryption the government cant access when the person is under arrest... ya know, for nothing. I dont need to encrypt my bank info, or my WoW login info, or my credit card statements, or my SIN number, or like whatever the hell else people think they need to encrypt. "
"Can anyone give me some examples of non-tinfoil-hat things people legitimately  need to encrypt that arent incriminating? medical records, banking information, sensitive business documents, legal correspondence, personal familly issues, Tax info, basically anything you wouldn't want to paste to your front window for everyone to see"
"think of anything you would mail that you wouldn't want to just write on the back of a postcard (which anyone can read and roughly equates to an unencrypted message).Naw, thats hardly comparable. "
"A) There is no post man delivering my emails by hand and for some reason curious of my personal business. "
"B) Why do you have your medical records / digital medical records?"
"C) Why do you have your banking information on a computer? "
"D) Sensitive Business documents almost works, except any company with business documents worth looking at have an internal network and business infrastructure. Not personal use. "
"E) Your criminal record is accessible by anyone who wants to know. And its not like they email you your charges... so this isnt even a real thing."
"F) Personal family issues falls under the mailman thing. "
"G) Assuming you do your own taxes and would have that on your computer, uh who would give a shit? What are they gonna do with that info? Not to mention the flawed logic there. If someone is taking an interest in you enough to hack your computer/phone then they already know you make money. They arent going to hack you and be like oh man, tax info! This looks interresting!!. "
"People mail almost everything you listed above *every day*. Legal documents, tax info, bank information, business documents, and *especially family issues*. Medical Records are probably the only thing shared digitally, and even then you get your health card in the mail. "
"The only thing anyone encrypts are nude pics, and assuming you have them legally then there are much better ways to hide them. Look man I gave you a good answer I don't have to make you accept itThats true, but my reply wasnt so much for you as for anyone who reads it. But thanks for the answer, even if I disagree. privacy isn't about what you have **to hide** it's about deciding what you want **to share**Wording something to sound dramatic doesn't change the reality of the topic. The average person doesn't encrypt shit and they're fine. The only thing strong encryption protects are criminals. "
"Also, you're computer is fine. You a aren't important enough to worry about it. If it da real concern people wouldn't have had to brute force celebrities iTunes passwords to leak their nudes. "
"Gotta be realistic about this. He also said  The PC is dead. You shouldn't necessarily listen to this guy. "
"Not that I'm for weakening encryption...Well, yes, that's marketing. He's not going to say Windows is doing amazing! as CEO of Apple.It's such a shame Tim Cook of all people has to say this. Apple is pure evil, I don't want them making sense.leave and never return please."
"how is he evil?It's Apple. They're the closest thing to a real-life SPECTRE. Why do you even ask?Just because Apple products are generally sold at quite a high price and are very closed doesn't mean that they're evil.That is *exactly* what makes them evil.Evil, or just unappealing to you? Because I don't see any problem with selling those items unless they have a monopoly, which they obviously don't.wow nerdittors praising Apple.. next step: cops for doing their jobOh please, Tim Cook is just pandering like politician.  something something something ANDROID IS LUITERALLY HEAVEN AND APPLLE IS OUT TO RAPE YOU.The government needs to make strong encryption illegal. There really is no need to have strong encryption unless you have something to hide, i.e. criminal/terrorist intent. Also, by forcing weak encryption, this allows intelligence/law enforcement agencies the ability to more easily discern between legal and illegal activities. Terrorists/criminals will continue to use strong encryption and this will make them more easy to track.Weak encryption doesn't just let the good guys in; it lets the bad guys in as well. That's the problem. If you pass laws that say nobody's allowed to lock their doors so police have easier access, criminals have easier access as well.That is a small price to pay to prevent another 9/11 or something even worse. Also, the government having more access to data will make it easier, not harder, to capture the criminals you are talking about. Weakening encryption can only be a net positive overall so it is a good trade off.Weakening encryption can only be a net positive"
"So you're okay with anyone being able to read your credit card number when you make a transaction?  I don't understand. There are many types of information that I'd like to keep secure."
"I do have something to hide: my money from criminals accessing my online banking. And if that happens, you can easily get your money back, but if another 9/11 happens or worse because terrorists can easily communicate over any network, then those lives lost can't come back. Also, government having more access to data will make it easier to capture criminals stealing your information, not harder.I hate Apple, but just this once...amen.Coming from Apple, this is hilarious. What? Apple seems to be the only one standing up against the government for encryption. While other tech companies (i.e. Google and Microsoft) are being very quiet about it. apple wants end to end so they can control you like they do all there users"
"Well by that reasoning I guess my bank controls me because I use https...>Apple CEO: If you halt or weaken encryption, the people that you hurt are not the folks that want to do bad things. It's the good people. The other people know where to go."
"What about the good people, for some reason or another, are about to do bad things?"
"They make up the majority."
"People are not born hardened seasoned criminals, they are made."
"The governments reasons for snooping is to stack the deck in their favor, to catch the newly Breaking Bad types before they reign a lot of destruction."
"I don't mind the government snooping because the government works on the rule of law. What I don't like is when corporate leaders feel they also can do the same thing, profit by it and in the meanwhile blow a lot of hot air about how they are defending their users when in reality they are not."
"Like Tim Cook is really going to throw in for all the users and allow potential terrorists a means to communicate without their encryption being broken. Yea, right. "
"And since one cannot tell the good from the bad guys, or when the good guys turn bad, then everyone gets snooped on regardless."
"I would be just glad if Tim Cook would stop all the Apple spying and tracking that Apple is doing themselves without the governments intervention, it's not like they need the money."
"Innocent until proven guilty is an decidedly American tenant. Not only are you assuming people to be guilty before providing any evidence, you're already willing to knowingly violate the rights of more innocents to find this evidence. It's people like you who will bring about the police state. "

"And you're *asking* for this. Why? Because of the one in a million chance you'll get shot by a drug dealer or a terrorist? Your more likely to drown in your bathtub, or die falling down the stairs. These enemies of yours are imaginary."
"I assume this means your for banning all guns? And for outlawing personal cars, soda, cigarettes and beer?>I don't mind the government snooping"
"Just think of the time when the people in power are not the ones you agree with, and how they can use and manipulate your data to make you conform. it sucks that people like you existThis guy is a frequent contributor to r/applesucks. I think we can safely say he's not looking at the situation very objectively.Probably an nsa shill :p"
"Apple CEO: If you halt or weaken encryption, the people that you hurt are not the folks that want to do bad things. It's the good people. The other people know where to go.>Halt encryption"
"Literally the dumbest thing that anyone could ever think of. It is the core element of network security. Without it, there is no such thing as secure communication over the internet.It's all fun and games until someone in power gets their iMessages sniffed on a public network.More like the password to their bank account.I agree with him. If you outlaw encryption, only outlaws will have encryption. I've heard the exact same argument used with 'gun' in place of 'encryption'. Of course, the key difference is that one protects your property with deadly force, while the other protects it with passive force.Sounds like a familiar sentiment. Yet the government has no problem regulating weapons. I'm not a gun advocate necessarily but it seems like common sense to me that when you outlaw anything you just create a black market for it. Same argument for the second amendment.Sure. But we'll be able to crack the encryptionSame argument is used by pro gunners about gun control. Ban guns, only criminals will have guns. What about guns?Like gun control. The NRA can use this exact slogan. 'If you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns.'And then yay the rest of us who use encryption to be secure will be monitored since we would be indistinguishable from the outlaws  Just like with gunsWhen did politicians start believing that making something illegal will stop criminals... they're fucking criminals. If they didn't want to break the law they wouldn't be criminals in the first place. Boggles my mind."
"Better not encrypt my coke trafficking operation... because that's illegal.... Wat!If we outlaw encryption, we will no longer be able to exchange commerce on the internet legally.Except thats a good thing for them because there's less encrypted traffic for them to filter throughWell that's the technical term.Encryption is never going to be outlawed. People don't understand that Encryption is not something you do when you go to your underground layer. Encryption = Internet = Gaming = Cars = Airplanes. You can't simply stop Encryption....Encryption is Love Encryption is Life. This is the same argument used by pro gun individuals in the US. It is just as relevant in this situation. I wonder if he agrees that same logic applies to gun control. Not really comparable. I don't need to go to a store to buy encryption - nor can I read a book and magic a gun out of thin air."

"You could download a gun :)http://cdn.project-disco.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/YouWouldntDownloadACar1.jpgyeah you actually can. Im pretty sure people were freaking out over a 3D printable one called the patriot.[Liberator*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberator_\(gun\))close enough lol :)Guns aren't magic. You can build a rudimentary one relatively easily. [This](http://www.northeastshooters.com/vbulletin/threads/179192-DIY-Shovel-AK-photo-tsunami-warning) dude made an AK almost completely out of a shovel with basic tools. You can make a simple shotgun out of a nail and two pieces of pipe. Most gun designs that are considered modern are from the 60s or before, newer guns just iterate on those same basic designs. No, he built a receiver, which is the easiest part of an AK to build. Now let's see him build a barrel and a bolt.He built about the same percentage of that gun as someone implementing a cryptographic package built the encryption. He also didn't mine the ore to make the metal. You'd be surprised how easy to is to encrypt something well starting from scratch, and you'd be similarly surprised how non-functional a receiver is without a barrel and a fire control group, let alone a bolt.I'm a sysadmin for a living and I own several guns including a few that I put together, so I wouldn't be surprised by any of those things. Bolts aren't hard to come by in this country, neither are barrels or fire   control groups. The engineering specs for all those things are also no more a secret than the math that you need to encrypt something. I imagine homemade bullets are a lot harder to make.The bullets themselves aren't the hard part. For bullets you just make a mold, melt some metal, and pour it in the mold. They're just a solid piece of metal. The hardest part of making a fully functional round is the primer, because it requires very precise work. But knowing that, you could always modify the design of the gun you're making to use rounds that don't require that sort of primer, if you know you're going to be making your own ammo from scratch. Do you not also need to make gunpowder? Sounds quite complicated as compared to downloading some encryption software.you don't really even need gunpowder, but you do need a method of propulsion.It's all about skills you already have. It's easier for someone who is on here already to encrypt something using their computer, sure. But people, say where I grew up, out in the sticks. A lot of them already know how to make black powder. Smokeless powder is harder, but from what I know black powder isn't that hard and people still use it to hunt. They don't make it themselves because they can buy it, but a lot of them know how. Those people on the other hand would have a much harder time properly encrypting something and an even harder time actually coming up with encryption themselves. It's more about the materials you need access to. Yes some people might know more about manufacturing certain physical items than how to program or use software. "
"Point is the only physical materials you need to do encryption is a general purpose computer, you can't deny that's a whole lot easier to get than the tools and materials necessary to make a firearm."
"No, but you need materials as well as the instructions to make a gun."
"To use encryption you just need the equation. Computers make it faster, but you could do it by hand it you really wanted to (I wouldn't recommend it).To use encryption effectively, you need a computer. Nobody is SHA512 encrypting an entire message by hand, except cryptographers maybe. You also still need instructions to encrypt something, you need to understand math at a high level as well as knowing the algorithm if you're not using a computer. If you're using a computer, you need to know how to encrypt the message and how to send it, plus have the software to do so.Gun materials: Gunpowder and household junk + simple knowledge.  "
"Encryption materials: Computer and education + complex knowledge.  "
"Not a big barrier to entry for either.But they're not talking about outlawing a specific set of encrypted data -- they're talking about outlawing encryption.  That's like outlawing the knowledge of how to make a gun out of a shovel with basic tools, NOT outlawing the gun itself."
"Which makes enforcement something that belongs to the Thought Police: I see that you're doing something with that data that sure looks like it is transforming it into something unrecognizable.  I don't care if it's your bank account number or the plans to a secret airplane... what you're doing is illegal and must be stopped!"
"Here's another thought: what's the difference between encryption and encoding in general?  Are they going to make binary blobs and network level compression illegal too?  Because strong compression is indistinguishable from strong encryption.A nail and two pieces of pipe aren't thin air."
"Encryption is also less likely to prune you out through natural selection when you accidentally make a pipebomb and trigger it next to your face.You don't encrypt things out of thin air either. Unless you're literally doing the math to encrypt and decrypt something yourself, which the average person is not doing or going to do."
"Edit: effectively encrypt I should say. You can technically encrypt something with a caesar cipher easily without a computer or some other hardware, and it would be broken pretty much immediately. People didn't used to send bullets going 1500-2500 feet per second, until somebody thought up the gun. Your argument is like saying You don't shoot things out of thin air. Unless you're literally throwing a bullet 1500-2500 feet per second to cause damage to something, yourself, which the average person could not do."
"Of course they can't. That's the point of a gun. Likewise, calculating by hand RSA encryption has little practical use. The technology that actually *enacts* RSA encryption is very useful."
"Just because some individual cannot do it themselves, doesn't mean there isn't a solution that does it, or does it very, very well."
"That's really what is incredible about being human. If you have a problem, it's very likely that it's been solved, at least to some extent. If you're resourceful enough, you can take hold of that solution. Somebody's already out-thought you and figured out how to solve the problem. You just haven't found that solution, yet.> You can build a rudimentary one relatively easily. This[1] dude made an AK almost completely out of a shovel with basic tools."
"lol yeah, all you need is a full metal shop with a forge, a magazine, and the ammo. So easy! That's why, as we all know, criminals make their guns instead of buying them from straw purchasers.People are so far removed from how things work it is hilarious. That forge is some concrete sitting over top of some brick and with fire inside. Magazines (not clips) are just bent metal and a spring. The ammo is the hardest part to make yourself, more specifically the primer, but you can still do it. High-quality firearms were being manufactured long before steam engines were invented. do you know how many shooting sprees have been committed by people with home made guns in countries with stricter gun laws?[deleted]Compared to the rest of the civilized world it's the largest factor."
"Is mental health an issue? Yes. Media coverage? Yes. Preexisting crime rates? Yes."
"Does making it harder to get guns have a more immediate effect? Overwhelmingly, yes.Well it's a large part of it. You do know that In most of the shooting sprees that occurred in states with gun control, the guns were obtained in states without control, right?It's certainly a big factor.I think Americans fail to understand that *guns* aren't the American exclusivity, *gun violence* is."
"Guns don't kill people, but people without guns don't shoot people.Although to be fair the entire point of this comment thread is that if you outlaw X, only the outlaws will have X the point is there won't be a place where people don't have guns to shoot people. The whole concept is that isn't possible. You just create a place where only the criminals that want to shoot people have guns. "
"Criminals have guns in both scenarios, the difference is that law abiding citizens don't. None because there's no point for now. If you banned 100% of all guns, that's when you would see homemade guns, just like you already see homemade bombs. No amount of legislation can prevent people from killing each other. Humans are too fragile.I don't recall seeing any homemade guns while in the UK. You can still get guns in the UK. You can get up to a .22 rifle in the UK for pest controlYou mean [like this?](http://imgur.com/MkJSRRB)"
"That is a .22 I bought for my dad for his birthday.So I've always considered myself more on the anti-gun side than the pro-gun side but I understand that complete prohibition won't work (just like with drugs and such), but I've never really seen an argument that adequately explains a responsible pro-gun opinion (ie a good way to have pro-gun [rights] legislation while simultaneously reducing gun violence). Do you have one/know of one? Not trying to be a dick or anything, just would like to be more informed on the topic.Yes, we need more conceal carriers, and we need to get rid of gun free zones. Think about it, what is the one thing that stops an active shooter? Police right? Well how do they stop the shooter? They shoot the shooter... with a gun. You could argue vigilantism should be left to trained adults, but conceal carriers go through mandatory training already. And people practise shooting guns all the time for fun, so it's not like accuracy would be an issue. [There are already many examples of people taking down shooters with their own guns](http://www.personaldefenseworld.com/2015/03/10-cases-where-an-armed-citizen-took-down-an-active-shooter/#10-cases-where-an-armed-citizen-took-down-an-active-shooter-2), and since conceal carrying is getting more popular, I expect to see more stories of people preventing or mitagating shootings.Ok fair enough but a lot of people (myself included) are just uneasy with the idea of anyone being able to have a gun on them. Like there are a lot of people who would pass a screening process but could still have crazy anger issues (ie road rage).  I know they are definitely a huge minority and 99% of gun owners are responsible but that 1% scares the shit out of me.Here are some statistics that should make you more comfortable then."
"Gun ownership is already common. 1 in 3 people own guns. You've gone your whole life surrounded by gun owners."
"Everyone aside from convicted felons are already allowed to have a gun on them. Everyone can already transport guns in their car. We bassically have unrestricted access to firearms in this country, and we haven't descended into anarchy. Anyone who wants to kill people already has unlimited freedom to pick up a weapon and kill people, yet it's extremely rare. "
"Relative to other ways to die, guns should be the least of your worries. If you're confident enough to get on the freeway, there's no reason to be scared of guns. Over a million people die a year to car accidents. About 10k die a year to guns. I just don't understand how it's so scary. I'd be more worried about a bad diet than guns."
"Crime is at an all time low. You're living in the safest time in american history, and our gun laws have only been getting more relaxed. Gun laws used to be really restrictive, even in red states because people feared black people. Over the past 50 years, we've made huge amounts of progress in expanding gun rights, and we're only getting safer. This is actually a terrible argument. One would expect most shootings to occur via large-scale manufactured guns because there are far more of them and in the USA they are (for people who aren't good at DIYs) actually easier to come by. Make store bought guns illegal long enough and you won't be surprised to find out how many more murders there are committed by home-made weaponry.None, because why would you make an inferior product to do the job of a superior product that's easily obtained?What's your point? It's obviously still possible to acquire mass manufactured guns in those countries, and that's far easier than making your own. But if literally all guns were outlawed and unable to be acquired, then you can bet people would make their own guns.> http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2015/08/11/mystery-9mm-machine-pistol-seized-europe/"
"Soon, many."
"The Charlie Hebdo shooters didn't even need to make their own, and that was in France.ask chicago.None, they use either the guns they can still get or other means like arson/bombs. My point is that guns aren't magic. They're made from pretty basic materials. Funny you mention that.  In recent months police agencies have been finding these mysterious fully automatic machine pistols all across rights restrictive European nations...  http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2015/08/11/mystery-9mm-machine-pistol-seized-europe/"
"The origin of the pistol is still unknown.Oh what a shocker, criminals can get guns even if they are banned!"
"I don't understand why its so hard for people to understand this. [deleted]One thing I find very curious is the fake manufacturer markings.  If they are fake, then why bother doing the work to make them?  Is there some sort of underground product market to the point where there is brand recognition or something?I'd imagine so. With out some sort of name you're gonna walk up to your underworld gun dealer and ask for the black one with no name. It helps give a way to reference it just like people brand their weed or other drugs. So you know your getting the same thin you ordered before.I could make a bomb out of stuff I can buy at the hardware store. But we don't have complete assembled bombs on the shelf for sale because this would obviously lead to more bombings.The exact same logic applies. Both are tools that law abiding citizens can use to protect themselves and their privacy, while they're also capable of misuse by criminals. Any kind of ban only applies to law abiding individuals (by definition)."
"The only differences appear in their perceptions. One person might think Yes! Outlaw encryption because I don't have anything to hide while another person might say Yes! Ban guns because I don't have/like/want one.A gun is a phyical thing. You can't read a book and suddenly have a gun in your hand, or download ammunition."
"Encryption is an algorithm, a numerical recipe. A more apt analogy would be banning the recipe for gun powder and claiming this will stop terrorists from shooting people.would you download a bullet?The difference here is that it is literally impossible to outlaw encryption. Anyone with basic computer literacy can set up encrypted communication no matter how much the government tells us it's illegal. It's just math.We just have to encrypt guns and then guns are impossible to outlaw. Checkmate.The difference here is that it is literally impossible to outlaw guns. Anyone with a 3D-Printer or lathe and basic machining skills can make a gun, no matter how much the government tells us it's illegal. It's just fabrication.It's baffling how much Reddit loves to believe and enforce their echo chamber. What you said is entirely accurate, and yet they seem to think it's incredibly easy to just find a CS major who will encrypt stuff for you. I bet it's easier to convince a local machinist to break the law and make a gun than to convince a CS major to do it. But all it takes is a couple people downvoting you to hide your counterargument and help them maintain their hilariously ignorant confirmation bias. It's equal parts funny and sad.But you only need a few CS majors for everyone to have encryption."
"Also the encryption export bans didn't work either.CS majors are people, not vending machines. Not everything uses encryption, and it isn't suddenly going to start if it becomes illegal.What are you trying to say here? I honestly don't get how that applies to what I said.>find a CS major who will encrypt stuff for you"
"Why would you need to do that? There are loads of extensions and add-ons that allow you to use encryption by literally just clicking a few buttons:"
"[Virtu email encryption](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/virtru-email-encryption/nemmanchfojaehgkbgcfmdiidbopakpp?hl=en-US)"
"[Encipher It](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/encipher-it/fimncfoplhkgepigcpgjheeccdhemcfj?hl=en)"
"[Cryptocat](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cryptocat/gonbigodpnfghidmnphnadhepmbabhij?hl=en)"
"etc.It's a sad day when reddit has fallen so far that its users think running a few GPG commands requires a CS majorI mean, not necessarily a gunpowder firearm, although that's not *that* complicated, but everyone and their mom can make something deadly with much ease. Encryption, though, that shit is mad science to the overwhelming majority of people.But you don't need to *create* the crypto, merely download software. The issue isn't that the technology is trivial, the issue is that it's merely information and can be freely transmitted, copied, installed, and used by anyone. "
"Guns are tangible property, so while it's certainly possible for people to exchange the commodity, it takes a good deal more effort to acquire an illegally made or smuggled gun than to download freely available software. "
"Think about the protest aspect as well. If all guns were outlawed and collected, it would require a pretty substantial effort to distribute guns to a major share of the population. But digital revolutionaries need only publish openly licensed open source software from an off-shore server to completely subvert the ban... and the entity engaging in this protest doesn't even need to spend a lot of money or risk prosecution."
"Finally, consider enforcement. Exactly how would a ban on encryption be enforced? To know there is encryption at all, the government entity enforcing the ban would need to intrusively monitor billions of digital communications devices on a fairly constant basis. But if the crypto is any good, it would be nearly impossible to even detect in the first place, whereas a gun would become fairly easy to spot the moment it was used. So while enforcing a ban on guns would probably be difficult, enforcing a ban on cryptography would be literally impossible. You don't need to be a CS Major to set up some encryption software. You just need to know how to use Google and have the ability to read for about 10 minutes. That's a lot less skill than 3d printing a working gun (which you still have to buy the ammunition for from somewhere)Wasn't there a design on the internet a bit back for an m16 that is good for a few hundred rounds."
"So technically anyone who is good at google fu can make a gun.Yes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DconsfGsXyA"
"They get to about 30 rounds in that video but I assume they've made more progress.Oh this is what we're gonna do today? We're gonna fight?This is just a wild guess, but I'd say computers/computer skills are a bit more common in the general populace than machining equipment/machining skills. Also bullets.I am actually very pro-gun, but I really don't think it does any good to bring it up in this situation. The UK (which has already essentially outlawed guns) now wants to outlaw encryption, and my point is that no matter how hard they try, they will never be able to outlaw encryption with the same effectiveness that they have outlawed guns."
"The UK hasn't outlawed guns or anything like it. It has LICENSED guns and there are over 1.8 million in private ownership. Thats a lot for a country of 65 million where guns are supposed to be outlawed. "
"Millions of people in this country have fired weapons you're not even allowed to as a civilian in the USA such as fully automatic assault rifles. By the age of 14 I'd fired everything from a .22 rifle through to a 7.62 GPMG, the British equivalent of the M60, and a 40mm Bofors anti-aircraft gun."
"Shit if I want to fire a gun here in England without a firearms license I can walk half a mile to my local gun club any weekday night, pay a PS4 non member range fee, pay for my ammunition and use one of their club target rifles.You can own machine guns in the USA. It's complicated and like everything else, partially state specific, but you can.The principle is the same for both, the difference is that encrypting something takes literally millionths of the effort machining a(n effective) gun does.One time pads are dead simple and can be done using pen and paper. So long as the key is random and never reused, it's an incredibly strong system.That doesn't make it impossible to outlaw it. At all. It makes it impossible to eradicate it. "
"Which is also true of alcohol, drugs, guns, and basically any other highly marketable thing. Outlawing them does not make them go away - except in the hands of those who revere the law above all else i.e. *not* criminals.>That doesn't make it impossible to outlaw it. At all. It makes it impossible to eradicate it."
"Sure, a semantic error. You knew what I meant."
">Which is also true of alcohol, drugs, guns"
"Encryption is different from these things in that it is not a physical, tangible thing. It is essentially just an idea. A government can no more prevent multiplying two numbers together than they can prevent encryption (actually that's really all [encryption](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(algorithm\)) is). I agree that drugs and guns cannot truly be completely eradicated, but they can be to a much greater degree than encryption can.And to take it a step further, if you know the the government is looking for encrypted traffic, you can start hiding communications inside other data. For example, I wrote a working program that let me hide the entire text of the Neuromancer inside this image:"
"http://i.imgur.com/hR1dRZB.png"
"Granted, this is not the actual image file, I used a bitmap (which would be considerably larger in size) but it *can* be done. You'd never know there was any information hidden unless you knew specifically *where* to look (it is possible to find it, see if you can!), and even if you found it, you'd still not be able to read it unless you had the encryption key.ELI5, where is the data in this image? Sounds really coolIt's called [Steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography) and it's pretty cool.It's hard to get a true ELI5 explanation, but bear with me. "
"Any computer image is nothing but a huge array of pixels. Each pixel requires a certain amount of data to accurately convey color. In this case, each pixel uses three bytes. This is called 24 bit color mode. Each byte consists of eight bits. (8 bits *x* 3 bytes = 24 bits). What I do is take the least significant bit of each byte, and set it to one bit of payload data. You are left with an intact image that is visibly indistinguishable from the original. The payload data can be arbitrary, but in this case, I included an encrypted, compressed text file of the story The Neuromancer."
"The amount of data you can hide is determined by the geometry of the file. Let's say you have a 640x480 bitmap. Each pixel needs three bytes, and each byte can hold one bit of payload data. So... this bitmap would be approximately 921 KB. That means, I can hide 921 Kb (kilobits) or 115 Kilobytes. You can hide a LOT of data in 115 kilobytes.Thanks for that explanation! I suppose you don't even need a reference image to determine what data is there so long as you know the image is carrying a payload.Correct. There is a fixed scheme for how the data is stored. If you supply the correct key, it will be there. If you don't, you'll never be able to distinguish what's there from background noise.To elaborate (someone correct me if I'm wrong), the data being hidden in the picture is only a layer of obscurity (not encryption). It's like hiding a box in the bushes. "
"He mentions that, once unpacked, his payload is encrypted. So it's like he hid a box in the bushes, but also put a lock on it. Now someone would need to find the box AND have the key to unlock it."
"This distinction is an important one in cryptography because simply coding your payload into a picture like that could be easily intercepted if anyone ever deciphered the process (in this case, to look at the least significant bit of each byte).Comparing encryption to locks is misleading.  Encryption transforms the data.  So it's more like he took a box and stuck it inside wet concrete molded into the shape of a rock, and then  hid THAT in the bushes.  Now someone needs to find the rock, AND know that there's something inside worth chipping away at it to get."
"But you're right: steganography requires the original content be properly encrypted (such that cryptanalysis doesn't find any non-random repeating features) or else discovering the encoded content and then reversing it becomes trivial and can be automated.I mean the same applies to every illegal act. They've banned certain things but they keep getting done by the criminals who don't care about the law. Murder is illegal but that doesn't stop hundreds from being murdered every year. Drugs are illegal but that doesn't stop literally anyone from getting and using them. "
"Banning encryption only serves to make the innocent more vulnerable. Correct. You cannot uninvent something that already exists."
"It's staggering how many people I speak with that do not get this simple idea.Guns have been invented, yet are illegal in many countries. Same with cocaine. Right, because it's so hard to get cocaine or guns in countries where they are illegal.As is marijuana.If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns. Yeah but you cannot un-invent a gun or cocaine. People still use guns and cocaine even when illegal.Encryption algorithms are widely available (you can download from another country or ask an CS undergrad to code one up for you). At least with physical goods you have a chance at restricting access.So... basically.. Personally encrypt shit you want to keep private? Isn't this a given? Anyone who values encryption can't trust a corporation that is also lobbying for something else. If they want it bad enough, they'll sacrifice anything provided they can still deny it. "
"Sure we can trust Apple, Google or DroptoNSAbox, but that is just ignorance. Look at The Fappening.. Look at Google. They're a company that started off based on AD revenue.. You think your personal information is something they want locked away and inaccessible? Like discovering a inhabited continent Tell that to the war on drugs. I'm just saying. This is Apple we're talking about. Nothing is invented until they invent it.>  You cannot uninvent something that already exists."
"Counterargument: Like crypto, child porn exists and can be copied at zero cost, but banning it reduces its availability to everybody, including the criminal element."
"So banning stuff, even trivially producible stuff,  often works OK.>It's staggering how many people I speak with that do not get this simple idea."
"I get it, but from a certain perspective it isn't. "
"For many American's (or, humans in general), their exposure to technology isn't from a position of an informed consumer."
"Take for example: "
"* Verizon Wireless has a new ad that touts 50% less cost for their 'XXL' data package."
"* Fine print: 'compared to the next lowest tier'"
"Wat. Da. Fug. That's just one example. "
"Reddit, especially /r/technology, has a user bias as most users are embraced to modern technology, more informed, and passionate about keeping it free."
"That's not the case elsewhere."
"Look at Comcast. They own media outlets for a reason. (Granted, many reasons...). Imagine being able to influence people across multiple media outlets, while at the same time creating artificial limits in the communication pipelines (the internet) to boost profits. "
"So when it comes to things like cybersecurity, encryption, etc., how can we expect the average citizen that can't program their own DVR to understand it?"
"I passionately think (speaking as a US citizen) US citizens need to know more about encryption, don't think I'm arguing anything different."
"The way technology is changing, the population body really will have a hard time keeping up. As we approach the 'AI bubble' where algorithms and slick programming are going to start replacing jobs, we talk about it and it's exciting but we often forget something: **We're not telling people to stop getting degrees in areas that are going to get replaced; on a larger scale, we have no plan for what to do when thousands and thousands of jobs are replaced**."
"The other day I saw a machine that was flipping a sign. Yep. They automated the need for a sign flipper. Then we start thinking about automation in bigger categories. Fast food. Trucking. Driving. "
"Point is, all of this stuff is changing and we really need to understand that the population majority won't understand it. At that point something like encryption becomes an argument of Aren't you tough on crime?. Same reason bills like the Patriot Act pass. It's not patriotic. It's just a name. If you don't support it, YOU AREN'T A PATRIOT."
"You don't support banning encryption? YOU SUPPORT CYBERCRIME."
"Fucking awful. "
"The thing that's kind of more ridiculous is the existence of one-time pads.  Trivially simple encryption that's also perfect, and works just fine for digital messages or written ones.  They DO require organization though.So you're saying you can't put the shit back in to the horse?I don't see why a skilled surgeon couldn'tIt's the same impulse that leads to echo-chamber rejection of any other culturally scary ... well, anything.  The Good People Like Me in a safe camp with the warriors guarding us, and the Bad People outside worldview is probably genetically embedded, and it's behind a lot of this. Intelligent people's brains shut down when they're scared, too."
"Same with gun control slowing down crime to an extent. Maybe the petty criminals but anyone that would want a gun could get one I think the difference between encryption and guns is that with guns, not everybody wants to use them. Of those that do, not everyone is going to have the time and inclination to become competent in their use. They say that if you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns, but in many areas that becomes a near reality even without laws banning guns. Those that do tend to use them in crime, often crimes of passion."
"But with encryption, at the very least, every time you buy something on the Internet, you're using encryption. I can only imagine what other legitimate uses mandating backdoors would endanger.That doesn't mean you can't make it harder for people to get."
"I don't think you should halt or weaken encryption, but I don't think the then only the bad guys will have it argument is the best route."
"I think it's better to compare it to locks. People need locks for many reasons. Weakening locks would make the entire nation less secure.That's a really good analogy. Nobody'd be stupid enough to say We need to ban padlocks! It must be easier for law enforcement to get inside a criminal's house!, and yet that's exactly what an encryption ban is.They'd only insist that the government gets to have the master key, which also shouldn't happen.The issue is that locks can be broken with enough resources, while properly built encryption is totally secure regardless of the money you throw at the problem.Like those TSA locks?"
"Yeah, they are a master keyed system, and people have reverse engineered the TSA master keys because you can get a large enough sample at any hardware store.Are we talking about guns or encryption?Both. Trying to completely ban/outlaw guns is beyond retarded, same goes for encryption. The desire to outlaw them, and most other things for that matter, is based on irrational fears and boogeymen. Only violent criminals and nutjobs use guns! Civil people have no need for tools of destruction,  Only pedophiles and people who commit crimes want encryption! Civil people have nothing to hide!.I think after the fappening  the public would be more aware of the need for people other than terrorists and pedo's to use encryption. "
"I don't want it to be difficult for my doctor to adequately secure my records. [removed]Thoughtcrimes.They've tried that with drugs, guns, and many other things. They can't even keep them out of prisons. Banning objects works just as well as banning knowledge. I do find it somewhat ironic that this issue is important to the redditing community at large and therefore the same anti gun control message is used- which reddit is largely against. "
"Outlaw X and only criminals will have X. Works in so many cases and is probably the best emotional appeal for an issue.> Outlaw X and only criminals will have X. Works in so many cases "
"Works in all cases. "
"> is probably the best emotional appeal for an issue."
"No emotions; only facts and logic.I don't really agree that it's an emotional appeal. It seems like a logical appeal to me because it logically follows that criminals won't obey the law and such laws will only harm law-abiding people. The difference is that Reddit sees encryption as benefiting everyone, while Reddit sees guns as not benefiting everyone."
"I'm not here to argue about guns, but they're right about encryption.this is the first thing i thought of when i saw that headline. same argument about guns.is gun control a major issue among the American prison population?  No. But a few still find their way into inmate hands every year. "
"My point is that prison is literally the most controlled environment that most people could ever be exposed to in the US and they can't keep contraband out of the hands of the prisoners. Even if we all lived as prisoners, we would not be able to completely solve the problem and I don't think that anybody is willing to live their entire lives on lockdown. No but drugs are.The whole scenario really makes me think back to a book i read in high school called Harrison Bergeron. You can't control the idea of encryption since it is just math. It is like legislating stupidity.[Harrison Bergeron](http://www.tnellen.com/cybereng/harrison.html) is actually not a book, it's a short story by Kurt Vonnegut! You can draw a lot of parallels between this and [Export Grade Cryptography.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FREAK)It has been a long time since i was in high school. looks like i remembered it being a lot longer than it was.Especially when the thing that exists is just math.And in some form or another has been around for 1000s of years. The Romans used primitive encryption for their military communications. "
"Anyone that's suggesting banning encryption is a grade A moron. Any politicians doing should it be removed on account of mental disability. They're not fit to run a lemonade stand, much less a government.I have found that drugs are fairly effective in undiscovering math. I've found the opposite. Amphetamine has turned me into a math/programming boss.[removed]I'm a professional methematician, and this joke is soooooo old. (but that won't stop me from using it)Using what? Meth or math? Maybe both? But if you stop using math for  meth then how do you know if you're getting ripped off.When you get into the really complex stuff, ma/eth cease to be differentiable. Tried it once in high school. *MAN* was it ever trippy. Never again. I'm done with derivatives.The cynical part of me says that the government knows this already, and it's not the terrorists' data they're after. Terrorism just gives them a nice excuse to ban encryption so they can spy on all of us. Look into the history of communism over the past century and how the U.S. dealt with it. You get stuff like the Red Scare, Bay of Pigs, and DOZENS of Democratically-elected Communist governments. Basically, Terrorism is the new Communism and we've been fed a crock of shit for decades. People are still falling for it. The Military-Industrial complex is very real, it's not some conspiracy.You should append more easily, because that's the issue. Not whether they can, but the resources required.They do.  But if you make it so only terrorist can use encryption, legally, it sure does make it a lot easier to spot the terrorists!you mean the realistic, sensical, logical, and historically-referencing part of you? that part is smart. listen to it.> Terrorism just gives them a nice excuse to ban encryption so they can spy on all of us."
"If they ban encryption the entire banking industry will grind to a halt. It's required for communication and secure data storage.While I think so too, it's not right to think that way. It's like saying all terrorist are perfect and that they will never make a mistake. The more info the government has the more chance they have of catching a mistake. I don't agree with that but you're argument for it is not goodEveryone always assume conspiracies, but in honesty the best way to do bad things is to find **true believers** and then direct their outrage to benefit yourself."
"Kind of the entire background of organized religion being created.Exactly. They know full well this won't do shit to help against der turrists, what they're after is control. Full control over everyone."
"Politician up-and-coming that might rock the boat and upset corporation's profit-making ability? Well let's just dig up their browsing history and smear them with some kinky shit they looked at 5 years ago. Suddenly they're unelectable!/r/conspiracyNever waste a good tragedy.Im probably going to get shit on for saying this. But this is the same Exact principle to gun control. It's different, and the comparison is disingenuous. "
"For one thing, control implies regulations. I don't think anyone thinks there should be no regulations on guns or encryption. So this would only work if discussing a ban on encryption alongside a ban on guns. And that's not even close to the discussion on the table; it's always been about the degree of the regulations."
"More than that, all things equal, they aren't. Encryption is far more important to liberty than guns in the modern era. Guns are a method, one of many, of protecting yourself. Encryption is the only method of protecting digital information, and information is everything; it has every piece if meaningful data on everyone on the planet. It's the largest violation of freedom in history."
"And lastly, defiantly saying that gun bans would never work because guns already exist is foolish when you look at nations that DO have a ban on guns, have low crime, and 1/4 of the homicides the US has."
"I'm not arguing for a gun ban, but trying yo say it can never work is retarded when you consider it exists and it works.  You can say it's not for us; fair enough. But don't say it's an inherently flawed practice.But there is no regulations on encrypting. I could encrypt any data I want in couple minites.Im more interested in what the non-cynical part of you says?That they're really just that stupid. 'The government' or elected officials? The latter makes policy, and can be astonishingly clueless.Thought police, crime prevention.its a sad state of affairs when cynicism and realism are indistinguishable.> The cynical part of me says that..."
"I don't think you're being cynical at all, given the bills they're trying to pass and the businesses paying government to push these bills.There is nothing cynical about your line of thought. This is exactly the case. For Your Safety is the oldest line in the book.That's hardly cynical. There is no shortage of unambiguous evidence that this is exactly what government wants. I remember reading somewhere a while back that the NSA still bulk stores encrypted data they can't access and then they come back and crack it years later once they have the computing power/ability to do so.Unencrypted data from Americans is on a rolling deletion cycle. If they don't receive a warrant within 30 days (IIRC) it's flushed. "
"Encrypted data is stored indefinitely, but there are not attempts made to decrypt it (computationally infeasible) unless they receive a warrant. And even then it should be computationally infeasible to decrypt. That would be in no way unsurprising.meanwhile, if you ban real crypto, people will buy from someone who doesn't. the rest of the world is getting real tired of our shitEven more cynical:  They know there's nothing to find and don't give a shit, but expanding data collection expands contracts and budget."
"Ultimately government should be a way for me to legally redirect public money into my pocket.> expanding data collection expands contracts and budget"
"The main aim is and always has been financial gain, but not though bloating, try fraud. If you get wind of an upcoming windfall e.g. an oil company finding a new field then you can invest in the company *before* the knowledge becomes public. A form of insider trading for all extents and purposes. "
"There are also dozens of proven cases going back decades when these spy networks have been exposed as being used to steal technologies and to get an advantage in trade negotiations. The infamous 2001 EU Parliament report into ECHELON details them and that's what was known about 15 years ago!"
"All of this stuff *pre-dates* the fascination with the War on Terror by a long-shot. Economic espionage has traditionally been the primary function of spy networks. It would be naive to believe this has changed. Security theater is an incredibly lucrative business."
"The NSA's primary 'function' aside from that is economic espionage, as it also spies on foreign countries.And the TSA's primary function is as a federal jobs program.Give a man a fish, feed him for a day.  Give a man a TSA screening job and improve employment numbers for low-skilled labor! Can we just pay them to pick up litter on the side of the roads or something like that? I feel like that would improve the populace's lives much more than what we're currently paying them for.I say we pay them to make art. Paintings, music, dance, Youtube tv shows, whatever they might be good at.  At least there is some evidence that exposure to art reduces criminal behavior, unlike TSA searches.there is everything to find out. a complete record of everyones lives. the amount of money you can extract from this is infinite. insider information in every market, deep knowledge in human psychology. a complete sample size for advertisers. the possibilities are endless."
"then the pervs get all their sexts. "
"they arent doing it for no reason. no one does something for no reason.Ah, the Iron Law of Bureaucracy: An organisation will always put its interests ahead of its goals. And another top quote. This thread is a goldmineIt's the first thing I was taught in management 101: the primary goal of *anything*, including any group, is self-preservation.Some of the government might know this and are tricking the parts of government who don't know."
"Always assume your politicians are clueless and keep sending them knowledge whenever it looks like they're ignorant.UK's minister of internet security used to work in Google AND FacebookWhat particularly objectionable things has Joanna Shields been responsible for?The fact that there are so many documented examples of rogue agents conspiring to commit criminal acts within an agency using the agencies' resources demonstrates that this is possible and probably likely. "
"Just humans being humans. Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.Hmmm, where have I heard that before? Yet that's just not how reality works.A good quote, but more of a general observation than an actual rule. You honestly think the NSA, our fucking intelligence agency, is just straight up ignorant? Bullshit. This is not ignorance, this is control. Nobody in power wants an informed public. Let alone a public with the means to defend themselves. Yes, your normal day to day politicians might be clueless but not our intelligence agency. "
"Edit- I'm a dangus and flew right past the UK part but the point remains. Top people in power are not idiots or ignorant. They are well informed. "
"It's a big club....and YOU AIN'T IN IT!-George Carlin> You honestly think the NSA, our fucking intelligence agency, is just straight up ignorant? Bullshit. "
"The commenters above are not referring to the NSA, but to politicians in general. It was suggested that the most likely case is that a subset of people in government want to deliberately spy, and the rest of the politicians just thinks they're doing the right thing, as told by the smarter/more powerful people. The NSA was never mentioned.I still have a hard time believing that the majority of politicians are unaware of the ramifications of all this. They may be outta touch with some issues but not when it comes to the subject of power, influence, and control on a wide scale.[deleted]But blatant ignorance is intent.[removed]I'm on your side, but I think saying our lives are at stake is a little hyperbolic. Plus, that's the type of fear-mongering we're trying to combat."
"edit: In case it wasn't clear, I'm on your side. As in, I'm for encryption and think it's important for protecting privacy, which, again, I'm for.If someone stole my identity they could pretty much steal my life along with it.Many medical devices we use on a daily basis rely on encryption. If that encryption is compromised bad actors could potentially gain access to things like medicine pumps, heart monitors, and many other devices. Lives aren't always at stake, but it's hard to say compromising encryption doesn't at least make us less safe in life threatening situations."
"Source: work in healthcare information security.This, also every Tesla on the road as well as every piece of farming equipment and grid connected power station. If we open ourself up to low grade encryption we give ourselves to whomever wants to hack and take us over.I managed to convince my mostly computer illiterate grandparents by comparing encryption to bank vault."
"A strong encryption is the shinny 2 ft solid steel door with all the fancy lock on it at the bank down the street."
"A weak encryption is like the wooden front door of the house."
"No encryption is like the public park across the street from the bank."
"When you have sensitive or highly valuable stuff, do you keep it on the bench in the park, a closet in the house, or in a locked box in the bank's vault?"
"And now they believe encryption to be very important and the government is been stupid.I prefer a safe, an envelope and a postcard."
"A safe has a lock and a combination that can only be opened with the combination or a lot of effort. This is like strong encryption."
"An envelope is openable by the government if they want but there are rules saying when they can and can't do it. There's also very little protection against a criminal who gets into your  mailbox. This is like a government backdoor."
"A postcard is public and readable by anyone who can see it. It's not necessarily plastered on billboards but anyone who handles your mail can read it  easily. This is no encryption at all.Haha. Yes, that does sound like a closer analogy. It was spur of the moment, and we were just at the bank. So that's the only analogy I could thought of at the time."
"Oh well, it worked, so that's all that matters. :PYou could use an analogy with only a safe.  Imagine a super secure 2 feet thick steel safe with a high tech ultra secure unlocking mechanism that's unlocked by some sort of iris scanner or facial recognition technology.  The only persons that can access the safe are those authorised to be able to open it by the scanner.  However the safe also has a shitty traditional pin tumbler lock and master key that overides the high tech scanner so that the government can come along with their master key and check you're not keeping anything they disapprove of in the safe."
"So what happens when some nefarious person comes along and decides they want access to your safe?  They obviously cant abuse the scanner to gain authorisation without another authorised person present, so the only weak point of entry is the shitty traditional lock.  Being a knowledgeable person on how such locks work, they know that there are several methods of entry using just the vulnerabilities of the traditional pin tumbler lock.  They could try and find a way to obtain the master key, but that's unlikely to happen.  They could drill the lock open and try to gain access to the inside of the other locking mechanism but this may be too much of a brute force approach that damages the higher tech lock, but it might just work.  They could however learn to pick locks and simply open the lock with a simple lock picking set purchased from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/GOSO-Piece-Lock-Pick-Set/dp/B0079IKMX6).  Even locks that are designed to defeat lock pickers can be overcome by someone who who [reasonably practised at the art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI7Lx-73lU0).  Lastly, they could find out what sort of key is required to open the lock and then manufacture what is known as a bump key that will [open up any lock of its type without even having to know what the original key looked like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=131j0htYIoU).  "
"So yea, not only has the addition of a master key rendered the high tech lock useless, but its also given a way of entry to anyone with a bit of technical know how that doesn't even require access to the master key.That is way too much information and fancy high tech stuff for my grandparents. LOL. Years of dealing with them has taught me that - when it comes to technology, keep it simple, keep it something they can relate to.What If Apple would just stop selling their products in the UK in th event of an encryption ban?considering Apple products are popular in the UK and the UK is a major market for Apple i am guessing they won't.Who would win, in that situation? No one.I know that Apple is too greedy to lose on UKs worth of sales..."
"[But *if*.](http://i.imgur.com/SZAXMD7.jpg)That cash that Joker is burning in that picture is absolutely nothing compared to the cash that Apple could burn. "
"Apple has approximately $250 billion in cash. "
"Scale wise, that's roughly 2,000 pallets of cash. "
"They could lose UK sales for a couple years and be totally fine, they wouldn't even blink. Apple does have ~~millions~~ billions in cash to fall back to."
"And who wouldn't love to see some riots in London over no more iPhones?"
"But yeah, everyone does lose.206 Billion actually, but yea, they won't pull the product, but they might get creative about it.Apple. Riot different.This is truly the most innovative riot yet.It's beyond innovative. It's ... *revolutionary.*It would probably cause enough public backlash to get the government to reverse its decision.One election cycle is all it would take. The politicians who made the law would be booted from office. Politicians against the law would be voted it. The law would disappear. Apple could sell their phones again. Everyone wins.Except for the massive loss of sales by Apple, it's gonna hurt Apple a lot more than the UK and there's no certainty it would take one cycle, that's just your prediction."
"Edit: I'm just pointing out it's not as simple a decision as this looks, there is potential losses/gains no matter what direction they go unless certain political action is taken.I personally hope that if Apple has any respect for the privacy of its customers, they would stop selling the products, and release a statement as to why they came to this decision.http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2127048/Apple-6bn-UK--paid-10m-tax.html"
"This article indicates that about 10% of Apple's revenue comes from the UK. That is quite significant, but considering what a firm position Cook has taken on this issue I would not be surprised if Apple pulled out of the UK rather than backdoor their products. Pretty old article 3yrs~. I really doubt it's that high anymore because Apple has expanded to several more markets since (namely China). Accommodating the UK regulations would be expensive and potentially damaging to the security of their services in other regions (you can't remove end to end encryption from iMessage in just the UK). So I could definitely see it being more worthwhile for Apple to pull out of the UK to at least some extent. Think of all the good press and publicity they would get. Wouldn't they just disable iMessage in the UK? Seems to me that this would be the most reasonable thing to do. I truly hope this would happen - if only to see Cameron backpedalling like the clueless cunt he is.You wouldn't see that happening.

"[deleted]TIL I'm a bad people. Obviously the government know that. Tim is saying this to inform the average citizen. The gov says they *need* to spy for their safety, and Tim is pointing out this isn't the case, and will only work against the average citizen.Tim knows that too. But he can't just say it that way. He's doing the best he can to retain our right to encryption. Good guy Tim CookWhat I really like is that Apple put a 'canary in the coal mine' with a statement on their webpage saying they have never surrendered data to a government agency (paraphrased). I believe the thought is that they aren't allowed to keep it unless it's true, and since they can't reveal a secret court order, they're giving a warning if they remove it. Quite a few websites do this, actually:"
"https://canarywatch.org/Tim Cook can and has been [saying it that way, to anyone who will listen](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/10/01/445026470/apple-ceo-tim-cook-privacy-is-a-fundamental-human-right):"
">I don't think you will hear the [National Security Agency] asking for a back door. ... There have been different conversations with the FBI, I think, over time. ... But my own view is everyone's coming around to some core tenets. And those core tenets are that encryption is a must in today's world."
">And I think everybody's coming around also to recognizing that any back door means a back door for bad guys as well as good guys. And so a back door is a nonstarter. It means we are all not safe. ... I don't support a back door for any government, ever.So this is why Tim Cook has been getting unwarranted sheit, all along? He doesn't want to get in line with backdooring and general security dismantling?I'm pretty confident that he's familiar with backdooringIt's funny because he's gay"
"Samsung's CEO is even more gay. And waterproofFor the record, anyone who doesn't use Apple products or has a Jihad against them: I've been able to format my Hard Drives using AES encryption for years, and when you reformat a drive it gives you three options in OS X.  Quick format which just writes over the old information, full format which writes 0s over every block on the hard drive before formatting it, and an extended format that will write random bits of data all over the hard drive and wipe it 7 times before formatting your drive.The formatting on osx is nice. When I sold my MacBook, I just picked the option to wipe three times because why not. Took 3 hours lol.The write 0 option is all you need. There has been ample research that it's impossible to recover data from a drive wiped like that.Actually, if that drive is encrypted and you erase the keys then all data will be no more then noise.True. How hard is it to brute force the keys? Serious question. I imagine the NSA has farms of systems designed specifically to brute form through encryption.Breaking it through brute force would be impossible, as in, the universe would undergo heat death before then even if you combined all of the computing power worldwide. Their only hope would be to discover and exploit a weakness in the encryption algorithm.> How hard is it to brute force the keys?"
"As shown above, even with a supercomputer, it would take 1 billion billion years to crack the 128-bit AES key using brute force attack. This is more than the age of the universe (13.75 billion years)"
"[Source](http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1279619)Don't forget, they can store your data and decrypt once quantum computing is viable. That might take a while, but when storing seriously incriminating stuff, this might be important.> Don't forget, they can store your data and decrypt once quantum computing is viable."
"AES is not vulnerable to quantum computers. Well, slightly, using something called Grover's algorithm, but doubling the key size will easily stop that.Quantum computers can't crack AES256, it remains strong even against Grover's algorithm For an encrypted hard drive, simply overwriting they key is sufficient. But 7 times man!then microwave it.  Thanks Mr. Robot.I accidentally chose this option when formatting a 300gb partition on an external hard drive. It took 14 hoursThat's the standard for many organizations and even the govt so I can see why Apple would support it. In reality a simple override with 0's is more than sufficient. Worked for a company that refurbished gov't/university computers for use in high school and elementary schools. "
"The gov't drives were often wiped once before sent to us and then we had to reformat them using the 7 write process. Took forever on mechanical hard drives.> Quick format which just writes over the old information, "
"Actually quick format just removes the directory entries that tell the drive that there's something there. The data is all still there, untouched. This is absolutely true, which is why I actually like the extended format options on OS X.  I usually just go for writing 0's because the extended format takes something like an entire day, but I totally appreciate having the option.I'm a linux sysadmin."
"Without strong encryption I have no idea how I'd do my work on a day to day basis."
"I'm pretty sure if the US outlaws encryption for everyone, then tons of companies will move to a country where it's legal."
"Are they going to outlaw it for personal use only and force everyone tech savvy to incorporate themselves? That's also silly.Don't be a pussy and just telnet.  Correct. And we have enough flaws in our security now. Weak encryption makes hack almost trivial. The government are the ones spying. The way this sentence is laid out, they are the bad people. What's the point in telling them this?Victim disarmament.If Apple really wants to get the message across, they should refuse to sell Apple products in the UK if they implement this. Make an example of them. When 60 million people can't get access to their precious iPhones, they'll start screaming at the government and the government will back down. And Apple can afford to forgo UK profits for a time.[removed]I've always thought of it like this."
"Trained robbers rarely bust down the front door. They get in through weaknesses in the building and surgically collect the cash, then get out as quietly as they entered."
"The government would rather bust down the front door and case the joint just to make sure you're not up to anything.The government would rather forbid you from having a door, actually.I will try a slightly different angle on why they want this. This is about being lazy. The government wants to leverage you against you when you do something bad. This is a nice way around the 5h amendment. "
"The FBI might be the front for this chatter on the hill but they are not the ones crying like babies. That is the DEA. The DEA had grown accustomed to wire tapping every one and any one they liked if they could even vaguely justify involvement in drug activity. These people hired IT people finally and no longer use standard level non-encryption to communicate.  They use end to end encrypted iMessages. This is why they are hell bent on bringing down iMessage. The DEA does not want to use human intelligence they just want to go back to the old way they worked which is skim and exploit you agains you. "
"This terror smoke screen is that a smoke screen. "
"I am now putting on my tin foil hat, and say once they have this massive data bank who is minding the shop so to speak. Once you have this data how will it be used if your not subject to a current investigation. This is where they invoke the secrets act. The end point is full history of you and when it suits them call it back up. This should be immensely scary to people.  You realize this is about the UK, not the US right?I am aware.  I am also aware that the UK could be a bell weather for where america wants to go. The Five Eyes arrangement makes it too likely that expanded surveillance powers in the UK -- where they already record *all* Internet traffic under Tempora -- can be used against Americans via intelligence sharing and parallel construction. Something scarier than the NSA is the NSA minus the Bill of Rights, and there is such a thing: GCHQ.Well that is trueAaaaaaaaaaamen.  "
"Organizations under the governments, like the CIA, FBI, NSA, already know this.  Our leaders are either naive or evil enough to believe it.  A-fucking-men. Laws are not there to stop the law breakers. Law breakers don't care about breaking the law."
"It's the UK government to be specific. They are not to be trustedInformation gathering is not to counter terrorism it is to get an advantage in economy. It has nothing to do with fighting terrorism Ten bucks says he won't apply that logic to guns.If you outlaw guns, then only outlaws will have guns."
"Well, duh.[If you outlaw encryption, only outlaws will have encryption.](https://xkcd.com/504/)It's pretty fucked up companies are trying to protect us from our governments. It should be the other way around.You can replace the word encryption with the second amendment and still have a true statement.   As a matter of fact, the first amendment would also be an appropriate substitute. Finally, something from Apple that I can get with! Apple CEO..."
"You mean Tim Cook?OP: He who shall not be named...How many people off the street would know who that is though? It's better to make it easier for people to recognize."
"Edit: AutocorrectTim Cook"
"You mean the CEO of Apple?Apple CEO..."
"You mean Tim Cook?Yes, the CEO of Apple is in position to be Tim cook."
"Wait a minute....WTF? Why am I seeing so many comments about gun control in here? It's not even remotely close to the same issue. If I owned a gun, there's no way a government or other entity could spy on me with it."
"As soon as we allow one person in through a back door, it means criminals can get through it to. There's no point in twisting that analogy to work with guns because computers can't kill people (unless it's a big server and falls in someone).Because the If you outlaw encryption only outlaws with have encryption is a verbatim argument against gun control if you replace encryption with guns. This argument is super common among gun control opponents.ITT: gun controlThis is EXACTLY the same argument that can be used ANYTIME a government wants to use to ban anything. If it has a good side and a bad side (which everything does) then someone in government wants to take it from the people. Bad people will be bad no matter what the government does. except in this case, the solution being proposed would do literally nothing to hurt criminals. they would simply not use algorithms that have a backdoor."
"for the average person, this is a nightmare scenario. breaking encryption is essentially a nation-wide enforcement of compromised internet connections for individuals and businesses. "
"on top of that, the government would have full plaintext access to all communication sent by any entity using a device in their jurisdiction."
"> Over the last 16 months, as I've debated this issue around the world, every single time somebody has said to me, I don't really worry about invasions of privacy because I don't have anything to hide. I always say the same thing to them. I get out a pen, I write down my email address. I say, Here's my email address. What I want you to do when you get home is email me the passwords to all of your email accounts, not just the nice, respectable work one in your name, but all of them, because I want to be able to just troll through what it is you're doing online, read what I want to read and publish whatever I find interesting. After all, if you're not a bad person, if you're doing nothing wrong, you should have nothing to hide. Not a single person has taken me up on that offer."
"Glenn Greenwald in Why privacy matters - TED Talk*drops iphone*when they talk about banning encryption what does it actually mean for someone who isn't computer savvy? Do they mean anyone can read my emails and messages etc?It basically means if you ever thought about starting a company that helps people who have had identity theft it's becoming a really good time to do it.so, then we all have to become criminals with the knowledge to encrypt our own phones. "
"we all go to jail>not enough jails and building them seems silly> everyone on lifetime house arrest>still go to work/school/hang out and live our lives because they still need people to turn the wheels and press the buttons, but under FULL surveillance>3 meals a day and full medical care provided at tax payer expenses>It's like requiring that everyone have no locks on their doors by law. Criminals will have clandestine locks installed and be safe. Law-abiding people will be in constant danger and have their homes trespassed into all the time by criminals.This is the same paradigm with the war on drugs."
"Simply outlawing and maybe adding stronger punishments does not give the government control more control. In fact it does the complete opposite. You lose control of what you are attempting to control.'Good people', have morals, morals are anti-government..100% true and accurate. If you halt something that is mostly used by good people, to protect themselves, the bad guys will still be able to hurt them."
"Sound familiar?"
"I was legitimately flabbergasted when I read this headline. I thought to myself....this is exactly the same point with law abiding gun owners.This is the same for gun laws.Could we not replace the word 'encryption' with 'firearms'?Exactly like gun laws.  Thank you for making a great parallel.  It's almost like the same argument with gun laws ... Take away guns from everyone then only the bad guys have them and not the good .Maybe Apple can put some funding into https://letsencrypt.org then. 2nd AmendmentThose who would give up essential liberty, to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety."
"-- Benjamin FranklinI think this can apply to weapons tooIsn't this the same argument with guns, drugs, and prostitution?Gun Control LogicI'm not really sure what this quote means.  it means anyone who is going to use encryption to evade the law will do so whether or not the encryption used is illegal."
"outlawing encryption or weakening it with backdoors severely hurts people who want to protect their personal identifying information when, for example, shopping online or accessing personal accounts from their mobile device. "
"compromised encryption can be exploited very easily for the benefit of hackers and identity thieves. in the security world, if an encryption scheme is  even suspected to be weak by some attack, it is essentially sworn off and replaced by a more secure algorithm. government-backdoor encryption is broken by design and is a joke in the security community. it's ludicrous that this is even being proposed let alone discussed in a serious manner.sounds like gun controlWhy does this sound like the anti-gun control argument?Same thing with gunsSounds like the argument for guns. Funny that we accept thus argument for encryption, but not gun control, especially with the advent of 3d printersSimilar argument to be made for overreaching gun control?[removed]Yes. Especially in the US as we already have 300,000,000 firearms in private hands. If you banned them tomorrow the criminals wouldn't turn theirs in and it would take probably 50 years to make a good dent in the illegal firearms. If you banned guns tomorrow, 99% of law-abiding people would also not turn them in.    > If you banned guns tomorrow, 99% of law-abiding people would also not turn them in.    "
"That's an oxymoron. I think it is understood to what I meant.  If you want to be technical, fine, 99% of law-abiding people would suddenly become criminals because they wouldn't turn them in.  Shouldn't the second amendment apply to encryption? Has anyone tried to make this argument in court? It doesn't seem like such a stretch of logic, if you think about it.I think the 1st Amendment is all we really need to defend encryption. The founders even used encryption when they sent letters (hiding messages in code). "
"You can't ban speech except in cases where it endangers others like screaming fire in a crowded theater or telling everyone to kill such and such (ex. Hate speech). Encryption by itself is neutral. It would be like trying to ban a language just because only a few people can read it.  "
"The only reason encryption used to be restricted was because it was classified as weaponry/state secrets and the 1st Amendment doesn't give people the right to endanger the nation by exporting/selling state secrets. However that argument is dead since everyone has encryption now. Restricting big companies from including high-end encryption for their customers doesn't change the fact that they can get it elsewhere. "
"Terrorists don't need iMessage and I doubt they trust it anyways. When they are building bombs or buying weapons do you really think they aren't buying military grade encryption? "
"> A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."
"Arms seem pretty ambiguous so maybe. But then again, that could also mean background checks for the use of encryption, just like people want background checks for the use of guns. Or maybe, just like you may need a permit to carry guns, you may need a permit to use encryption.It definitely seems like a huge stretch of logic. The second amendment deals with a completely different subject matter. Both encryption and arms are tools to fight tyranny. I think it's a valid comparison. I guess the logical step is akin to how patenting something people do every day in the physical world, but on the internet is absurd. So why do we draw a distinction between being armed in the physical world, vs arming oneself on the internet?[removed]The 1st Amendment and 4th Amendment seem to apply much more clearly here."
"1st -- no abridging the freedom of speech -- i.e. I can send you encrypted code, or whatever else I want."
"4th -- No unreasonable searches and seizures -- i.e. privacy against their reviewing my communication for code/content they don't like.I've never thought of it like this. Have an upvote No. It cannot; they are different entities with different uses with different reasons for existing with different abuses."
"It's like comparing oranges and rocks.[removed]There are similarities in the argument, but no similarities behind WHY you would make that argument, nor the objects being argued about."
"It's like saying training your dog to pee outside makes life easier, so you should train your kid to pee outside.> There are similarities in the argument"
"Isn't that literally what the person you were responding to was saying? Exactly, came here for this.  The only caveat is that if your kid accidentally gets your encryption keys he's not likely to kill himself. [removed]Many gun deaths are due to previously law abiding citizens. The kind of people who would not own an illegal firearm. Things like accidental death and 2nd degree murder (no premeditation, just anger). That being said, I'm against banning guns altogether. Waiting periods and background checks do save lives. Also, buying a gun on the black market is not as easy as the NRA would have you believe. It's also much harder for a 5 year old to understand encryption than it is to shoot somebodyWhich is a huge difference, so its not really the same argument at all when any sort of context is included.But that's the point: the authorities want to track the good people. They have other methods for tracking bad people -- they always have, back when encryption meant secret book codes and dead-drops. It's called espionage, and governments are very good at it."
"But they want to control the masses, and the best way to do that is make sure they (the masses) know that the government knows (or will find out) all their dirty little secrets.ITT: a gun control debate in /r/technologyMy thoughts exactly: when encryption is outlawed only the outlaws will have encryption!Why are we still buying into this terrorism argument? It's just a stupid talking point. This is about the average person and collecting their money. Government is strangling us with taxes and crippling the world economy to save their asses.  THIS IS ABOUT YOUR DATA AND HOW THAT DATA CAN BE USED TO CONTROL YOU AND YOUR MONEY. FYI public officials: If you're not smart enough to understand why weakening encryption is a very bad thing, you shouldn't be making decisions for the public interest. Think of Apple what you will, but come privacy these guys are on top compared to other major tech companies. The ol' gun control argument.Surprise! It was never about the bad people.This is pretty similar to part of the pro gun argument actually.The idea that stopping encryption helps catch criminals is ridiculous, any serious criminals will buy encryption packages if necessary.  "
"The war on data is like the war on drugs. Currently a massive waste of time and money.Apple CEO: I'll say whatever it takes to sell more product. I'm an Apple fan, btw.That's no doubt the whole point. "
"Spying on the average citizen is no doubt far more important to these agencies who want to weaken it than spying on the tiny amount of terrorists and the like out there. "
"The likelihood of anyone in an industrialized nation being a victim of terrorism violence is so low that it barely exists. "
"In the USA, in the past several years combined the amount of people dead from terrorist violence just barely ekes into double digits, as in somewhere between 10 and 20 depending on how you count and what you include as terrorism. Basically none of it was Muslim terrorism, which seems to be the bogey man du jour."
"Meanwhile, tens of thousands have died in traffic, 8500 people have been murdered with guns in non-terrorism involved ways, and millions have perished from preventable illnesses and the like. Terrorism barely registers on the chart."
"For that, people should give up their civil liberties and right to privacy?"
"Seriously?Ah, Apple CEO, you are so adorable."
"It's not to go after whatever excuse they can come up with. It's to acquire and maintain power by doing things like illegally monitor those communications through the ministries that have no supervision (i.e. defense industries) for the interests of those who govern so that they can keep on governing. It is so naively egocentric that they would seriously jeopardize the security of their telecommunication services because of it."
"The law is not for everyone. I though that myth had been debunked some time ago. It is a high ceiling that gives a house advantage to the established few and maintains order between equals.Were going to ban use of the letter 'e' while were at it.People that are always watching you can't be trusted. They're not doing anything useful and present only risk. Increased risk increases anxiety, unease. Increasing anxiety and increasing population density can yield only one outcome.Look fellow gun owners--another double standard!Computers weren't designed to kill people though....Same exact logic applies to gun control. NRA has being saying that for years. So if we ban guns the good people will be the only ones that are affected? hmmm...EXACTLY the same reason DRM is bad.I am all in favor of pervasive encryption but this is a silly argument.  Most crimes are poorly planned if they are planned at all, and there is a good chance the the cops will find something on the suspects phone which will aid the investigation / prosecution.  We're not talking about terrorist masterminds, we're talking about some guy who texts his buddies about how he's going to kill his ex's dog, and then goes and does it.u can't hack me, I got Norton!!http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nKf2KtXnhB8/Uqfif1t8tBI/AAAAAAAABBs/nyIWLXCBXCA/s1600/hackers-gif-preparing-to-hack.gifApple is talking to the people, not the NSA and the rest of the government.  The government already knows this because the specific reason they want this is to spy on Americans, not terrorists.Welcome to the gun argument. "
"If you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns. Sounds exactly like the argument for guns. Just as valid too.Funny. This argument being used for phones and surveillance when it is a strong argument against overarching gun control laws and often dismissed.I wish this logic would be applied to gun control. Is he talking about encryption? Or gun control?It's the same thing with gun control^^this, but unfortunately I believe the stereotype demographic that would own a Mac would probably disagree with you. Not all of those, mind you, just the stereotype. I'm glad you see my point. Yea the typical stereotype wouldn't agree that's for sure. It's an interesting concept I like to think about. It's the difference between a good idea in theory and a good idea in practice. In theory, you have a problem. Either gun violence or criminals/terrorists being able to encrypt communications. How can we solve this? Oh by putting backdoors into encryption or by saying concealed carry for lawful citizens isn't allowed and all high capacity rifles should be limited to 10 rounds and have a fixed magazine. In practice this is horrible. A terrorist or criminal will find the encryption without a backdoor. Same thing for someone wanting to kill a bunch of people with a gun. So you say they can only have ten rounds and the magazine needs to be fixed? They can still quickly kill ten people. Not to mention the fact that guns and gun hardware is available anywhere. Someone looking to kill many people isn't exactly going to follow gun laws. They will just order that pmag 30 online. "
"It's ridiculous that people think outlawing or disallowing certain things that are readily available will prevent people that have already chosen to break the law from getting those things. Especially gun control. There are millions of gun owners in this country. Even more guns. By suddenly trying to control them out outlawing therm you are only putting law abiding citizens in danger. So lawful people will listen. But that guy mugging people doesn't give a shit. They will likely be even more capable to get a gun because where are all the guns people owned that are now illegal?This same argument can be applied to gun control.So kinda like gun laws? If you outlaw guns for the good law abiding citizen then only then bad unlawful people will have guns.This is a great analogy."
"Encryption : protection of data :: guns : protection from terrible people.This is essentially the same argument many make on gun control..."
"Gun laws only affect law abiding citizens because the bad guys are already cool with breaking the law.correct"
"the differences are many, however."
"everyone uses encryption in their daily lives, whether or not they know it. they only reason a guy sitting in grand central/times square with a wifi sniffer can't collect millions of credit card number is because of encrypted network connections. weakening the encryption used on these networks would be a serious attack vector that would make everyone vulnerable to these attackers."
"additionally, there is a significant gap between the average gun criminal vs the average cyber criminal. anyone using encryption in a nefarious manner is smart enough to simply not use government-broken encryption. so the ban is essentially worthless."
"people who acquire guns for nefarious purposes do not need any exceptional skill or knowledge to do harm with them, but acquiring an illegal firearm is an actual challenge that may dissuade the average dumb criminal. Except the facts simply don't support that statement. The vast majority of crime guns come from straw purchases/illegal transfers and theft. The laws on the books prohibiting straw purchasing and thefts haven't done a thing to stop these illegal gun transfers. I struggle to see how adding more words to a piece of paper will do anything to dissuade criminals...i agree with the overall argument that gun control is worthless and mostly ineffective"
"however i wouldn't agree that banning encryption is in the same league with strict gun control. i would venture to bet that at least one gun crime has been avoided simply by virtue of guns not being readily available by a would-be criminal. however, exactly zero criminals who use encryption would be stopped by a ban on encryption. a gun is physical equipment while encryption is something that can be searched for and downloaded within seconds.So wait, conservatives use this argument for gun rights and get ridiculed by liberals for being naive, but liberals can use it use it for internet privacy rights and its justified?Kinda like gunsThis could be a quote against gun control"
"The same logic applies to owning firearms, drugs, our rights, etc...I think this a conservative gun control argument applied to a different technology. If you outlaw guns, only law abiding citizens will stop buying them. ITT: every controversial comment is about gun control Just like guns. They know this, and going after the bad guys is not their true agenda. These same people don't understand this argument for more restrictive gun laws...Same can be said for strict gun control. Making it harder for a law-abiding citizen to purchase a gun does nothing to stop criminals.It definitely does.Well, just about every single other country in the world handily disproves that notion. Well, I might not quite agree, but I'm afraid to open up that whole can of worms."
"> Making it harder for a law-abiding citizen to purchase a gun does nothing to stop criminals."
"Have the lax gun laws made it easier to stop criminals?It allows more citizens to defend themselves; yes.Yes, which is why we need more conceal carriers.This same argument applies to gun control. It has been, is, and always will be about those in control retaining their control. There is a reason why there is a trope about hackers being the ones to free society from the bonds of government. This is strangely like that argument about banning guns to stop criminals.Funny, I use this argument to argue against gun control and get told that's totes not the same thing.Says the CEO of the company that ships a known-compromised version of OoenSSH in its latest OS and hasn't updated it.If you're talking about the SSH default keys, iOS doesn't ship with a vulnerability. Rooted iOS devices have it. Very logical. Sounds a bit familiar though, oh yeah, it's the same reason to not get stupid with gun control. Let's all clap and applaud Tim Cook for supporting public interests in privacy and then be totally surprised and outraged when it is eventually found out that Apple has been sharing our personal information with the NSASame thing with gun control and drugs.This is the exact same argument against more gun control."
"More gun control means you hurt the people who are law-abiding as the bad people already break existing laws and obtain their guns illegally. Except that you can't shoot somebody in the face with encryption.yeah but your kid can't accidentally encrypt himself in the head with the key you forgot to lock in a vault.funny - same could be said for gun controlWe have seen this exact law making philosophy when it comes to gun laws.  They don't care that they are only hurting the good people, that's the entire point of the legislation...His name is Tim Cook. Just like gun control!Isn't this the same reasoning people use to defend gun rights?  It seems to me you could replace 'encryption' with 'gun rights' and it would read the same.  I don't think this says anything about either issue, but I think it does say something about this argument, like, maybe it isn't all that sound.NRA or Apple. Sounds like the same argument.Yet whenever we apply this same logic to guns, reddit freaks out.Amusingly this is PRECISELY the same argument that Pro-2A folks use in regards to firearms!That's funny, this argument sounds similar to the one against gun control. Same argument regarding gun control. The other people know where to go: away from proprietary systems and companies which can be strongarmed by fascist governments like UK."

It's only paying customers that ever have to deal with it because pirates just remove it.This whole argument they're presenting is basically saying we want to be able to raid houses of dangerous criminals easier, so we should ban door locks."
"It's so dumb and easy to see through that I really think anyone that actually buys it should be banned from ever voting again.What?  If you stop making it harder to do things, the good people will lose out as the bad ones already taught themselves to do the slightly harder things.  "
"...what?Ehh its all useless when the IT Vendors all allow backdoors for the NSA anyway.I love the fact that Apple is so strong on its stance when it comes to this matter. I really hope whatever comes next doesn't shake them from current their business policies. Working in the IT field for over 10 yrs. I can attest to that statement. I like the way he's ELI5-ing this one. "
"Bad things, good people. etc."
"This is the sort of thing we need, because governments will try to spin us out of our freedoms *democratically* by getting the ignorant to vote for bullshit.I love how everyone in here is so supportive of this statement but wont even look at the same argument for firearms.  In addition to that, banning encryption violates our right to free speech.I may be stupid to ask this but whats the long term plan. Whats their plan with motive with all this data what do you think they will do with the information?Not true at all. Many criminals use extremely unsophisticated methods to commit crimes...Oh yes, I'm sure the government wants to weaken encryption because it will help the good people in the long run. They're just misinformed, that's all! Give them the right information and you can bet they'll do the right thing! Honestly, I think that they can read encrypted data. Yeah, well, duh."
"If you remove your front door, it's not the burglars you hurt, but the people who live there."
"DEEP.Guys."
"Why is this a controversy?"
"Encrypted data is a fact of life. Federal and State laws will have to change to accommodate some hypothetical no more encryption political movement, one example being HIPPA. We effectively wouldn't be allowed to have electronic versions of patient data, which means no online/automated health-care services or health-care related services PERIOD."
"Also, encryption is merely a mathematical masking of data. Like, how can you be against that without being against things like compression algorithms. And who among us wants to outlaw 7zip?"
"To the informed, this issue is just non-sensical. Just a small point: the concept of digital backdoors has been around since way, waaay before Snowden..Thank you for that seriously obvious statementMight as well require all mail to be written on post cards as well. Federally implemented back doors are the same as someone telling you to leave your bedroom window unlocked. Stating, it's ok, we're the only ones who know about it.Honestly I have no problem for the government to spy on my internet/email/phone calls as long as they stop putting shit in my food and water and the air I breath....I find, that somehow, people who agree with this argument, tend to discount the analogous one for guns.Yes, so now allow there to be a GPGTools for iOS.This argument sounds familiar. Reminds me of the situation with immigration laws in the U.SWhy do we have to dumb down the argument to this level? Aren't the government helped by brilliant enough advisors?Encryption is a tool that ups an arms war of encryption/decryption. It can be used for good and bad. Not sure how having an unbreakable lock is somehow more good than bad or more bad than good at all.There are already end-to-end encryption services available for text messaging and VOIP. So how do they expect to halt or weaken these services? In those cases the only people who can decrypt the signals are the sender and the recipient.It's OK Apple, I've stepped my security up, Decoder Ring! Makes a bunch of sense doesn't it?"
"What benefit would the government get if they implemented wide spread monitoring? "
"They wouldn't catch the bad guys, they know how to get around."
"But direct advertising is pretty good reason eh? They know what you want so they give you ads for that stuff.this feels oddly similar to many things that are said in the debate on gun violence (not that i am for the people who want to put guns in every classroom or anything like that)I can't believe people are even *considering* outlawing encryption. I know lawmakers are dumb, but I didn't know they were *that* dumb...Silicon Valley should form its own country, or buy California and [secede from the union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secession_in_the_United_States). The tax benefits alone would be worth it. Slowly it could buy up other cash-strapped states, offering free education programs that fin in with an overall corporate agenda - giving rise to a new generation of scientists, leaders, and designers. As the old American Union slowly fades into obscurity, world peace will start to have a real chance.I see the echo chamber is still functioning.Typical politicians... If we make a law against something people will stop using it"
"We should outlaw cocaine. Oh wait....i.e. You have nothing to fear if you have nothing to hide.Unfortunately people don't feel that same way about guns yea, thats the point, retard - FBIIt's less about terrorism and more about affairs and strange porn. Im david cameron and I want to ban copy/paste in favour of sticking my penis is a pigs mouth please? See also: LawsSo Apple makes the 2nd Amendment / NRA argument and everyone is with them?Its true the FBI knows it too. The deep web is quite the place As someone going into network administration, I fear what this will cause if anything is passed to weaken encryption. So in other words the exact people who are being targeted....."
"Working as intended.I know he's not Steve Jobs, but I'm sure we'll all know who you are talking about if you say Tim Cook, lol.Quoting my network prof back in college:"
">For every lock, there is always a keyJesus Christ... Man in the middle attacks take zero effort if nothing is hidden!For once it isn't US politicians doing something stupid. Although I'm sure they're thinking the same thing. Been saying this about crackers DRM and piracy for years, exact same thing only people you hurt with draconian methods is the clean folks, anyone doing anything shady is generally going to be skilled enough that they can bypass your measuresEat shit GCHQ - I'm in Canada now!The thing is, there's no actual way to tell what he thinks."
"This is just the most profitable thing to say right now. He might mean it, or he might be saying it because he thinks it'll be a popular thing to say.Hate on Apple all you want, at least they're taking this stand.Which is of no concern to the people who want this. In fact, its almost certainly the entire motivation behind it.I've been saying for years that encryption, network security suites and certain types of hacking scripts should have 2nd Amendment protections. just be like FINE, NO MORE COMPUTERS THEN"
"After reading the article for the first time I am considering using Apple devices. So impressed.Wait, is this about actual computers, or a subtle metaphor from anti-gun control enthusiasts?He is absolutely right.Politicians don't care. They are paid but care. After all they are taught that they know better than everybody else.Wow - Tim Cook being smart.  Weird.First sense out of his mouthWow finally something useful from Apple. I didn't read every comment, but the overwhelming majority of the people in this thread have no fucking clue how this works."
"Data being secure and that secure data being untraceable by the government are sooooo different.What's the point behind weakening encryption? To make it easier to crack the encryption? A fucking no brainer. Might as well not encrypt at all. Could well make it to a modern-day Monty Python skit.Is it just me or does there seem to be a lot of similar rhetorical motifs between gun control and encryption policy?This logic could applied elsewhere also. Like on gun control.Only good guys with encryption can stop bad guys with encryption.This is my argument against gun controlSounds like the NRA but what do I know.If you make your devices closed source, the people you hurt are not the folks that want to do bad things. It's the good people. The other people know where to go.The exact same logic applies to citizen disarmament.This is why Tim Cook rocks. It's the same dumb government logic as gun control. Cook is a proud NRA member btw. Gates is a OBAMA loving hippy. Source? I don't know what Cook's specific stance on gun control is, but regardless of that I doubt you could really call him a conservative.You don't have to be a conservative to have a logical/non-fear based stance on firearms.No, but the rest of your comment seems like it is trying to portray him as more conservative than he is."
"I would still be interested in a source on him being a proud NRA member. I haven't been able to find anything googling around for it.Is this satire or can you come up with a source for Tim Cook being a member of the NRA?He assumes that the government isn't one of the 'other people'.No he's not. He's just being careful how he's framing the whole thing. He's not stupid. Perhaps. Maybe this would be better:"
"His statement implies or suggests that the government isn't one of the 'other people'.It sounds like he was telling a room full of 5-year-olds.All criminals are technologically sophisticated and all noncriminals are not."
"Simply not true.I remember years ago when I, as well as many others, looked at Apple as the epitome of evil corporation. Now that's quite far from the truth. I really respect most of what they've done in the past few years and the way they shaped their corporate culture is huge.If banning encryption will help keep bad people from doing bad things, shouldn't banning guns do it as well? Hell, why not just throw everyone in prison, because they just 'might' do something illegal at some point in their life.Hahahaha. Apple CEO doesn't have a name. Where is Google on this issue?Thanks for not circlejerking about apple.isn't that what they say about guns? In Australia, after a minor incident all guns are taken by the government and VERY few gun misuse and accidents are found. though I can't attest to the violence (sexual assault, battery, ...) being reduced."
"Though the transport of guns can be easily caught as Australia is a continent far far away separated by vast ocean. In America, it might be downright impossible. Where are guns manufactured and assembled anyway?I can build a gun in my garage in a weekend. 3D printing is a bitch"
"Strange. This is the same argument used by 2nd amendment rightists.Don't Apple and Google already have backdoors in their phones?Same argument for gun control. Apple only is interested in protecting rich people.  Can't have people of more-than-modest means being inconvenienced by being hacked."
"Exhibit A: The Fappening.  "
"Exhibit B: Their release of a crypto library that doesn't work.Wait, wait, wait, did someone from Apple say something totally correct?"
"To everyone that doesn't know how often you use encryption, everytime you see a https:// instead of http:// you're using encryption. You need strong encryption, because the bad people might want your info and with poor encryption and backdoors they are likely to get it, and then it doesn't help you at all that the government have the same info as the bad people."
"Also there are already really strong encryptions out there that the bad people probably already use, so a weak encryption only really hurts you.Great argument. Same argument for guns and bitcoin... and... everything."
"Same concept for gun ownership.This is the same argument against gun control. Imagine if the same logic was applied to gun ownership.Or RPG ownership, or tank ownership, or artillery ownership, or ICBM ownership...Private citizens actually do own those things... Although I'm not sure where one would buy an ICBM but the others aren't difficult to come by legally.You are being sarcastic but I don't think you realize almost no weapon is banned in the US. Just heavily heavily restricted when you get past weapons the typical man could carry.Outlaw both PGP and RPG!!!!! /sSo by your logic, you, a regular citizen, only need 8 bit encryption. Only the government should have the best encryption, because they are the only ones that can be trusted with it.I'm glad you now see how ridiculous it is to try and compare weapon ownership to privacy rights.  I wouldn't say it's ridiculous at all. The government has no business in what weapons I own, or what encryption I use.Privacy and guns are totally different.They are not mutually exclusive.  The 2nd protects the other rights.  The bill of rights is an enumeration of basic human rights, it's not a ranking of importance.What makes them different?Privacy is the the ability to think or perform acts in a setting or situation where information about these thoughts or events are inaccessible to others. "
"A gun is a device designed to hold,  and trigger,  a chemically,  electrically,  air,  or otherwise propelled projectile, at a remote target. "
"I already understand the technical differences, although I appreciate your response. I should have been more clear with my question. When it comes to government control of citizen activity, what makes gun ownership or use of encryption different? Why can this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/3sa38d/apple_ceo_if_you_halt_or_weaken_encryption_the/cwvdz94) get up voted, but some one applying the same reason get down voted?And yet both are considered basic human rights in the United States.I bet he hates gunsHe's from Alabama, so that's a big bet...Translation: I am saying this because it makes my company look great and the competition look like assholes. They can profit from your information and we don't. We profit using huge markups so we'll tell you that your privacy matters... unless we ever decide to make money off of your information. Then, we'll pull the fastest 180 in the history of anything. Oh, the government already has ways to get your info. We couldn't do business in the US if we actually blocked them.Says the company that uses slave labor, bloody minerals, and dodges all taxes."
"They are bad people, they just like to pretend otherwise.Dumb dumb here. What's encryption? "
"Edit: I'll Google it, but if anyone wants to tell me anyways I'll be forever grateful."
"Edit 2: Googled it and still lost. :/Encryption is used to secure information, often when sent to someone. If you want so send hello to someone and encrypt it, an algorithm will transform it so something like iwjqkiwnamk so that no one can see the content of your message during delivery. Only the recipient will have the counterpart to your encryption (like a key) to see what you originally sended. It's an important part of data security today and necessary to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks (systems that sniff in networks to get passwords out of the sent data)"
"If the government would force devices to have a backdoor, like a master key for the government to decrypt the data, they would be adding a severe security hole to the device, helping attackers to get your data. It's dangerous and stupid to go against encryption, since it's already hard to prevent hackers from trying to breach into your servers as a company.Its funny how this argument is invalid when it comes go drugs or guns. yeah, the government already knows where to go if they want to fuck over apple users"
"the engineers/programmers you hired, tim cookI know this is pithy and it's going to be front page material regardless of the facts but it's not actually true. I work in law enforcement and your average criminal isn't moriarty or even the villain in a typical law and order episode. I quite regularly find troves of incriminating evidence that they are carrying around for no reason at all. I once had a girl with a netbook who had an excel spreadsheet accounting for her cocaine sales saved to the front page without securing windows with any kind of password. Encryption saves these felons from their own stupidity. "
"In other words: *If I look hard enough, I can find something to charge anyone with, please let me look at all their stuff so I can charge everyone*No in other words if criminals were already encrypting their info then law enforcement wouldn't care since the evidence was already beyond reach. Reddit has this misperception that if it's common knowledge within the hive mind then it is common knowledge within society at large. It just isn't true. Most criminals talk to cops even after their Miranda warning. People give permission for searches all the time. Even when they are hiding contraband. "
"If the average criminal was smart enough to take sensible precautions he wouldn't be a criminal. The average criminal isn't encrypting, so banning encryption is a good idea......"
"Just because some people give up their rights willingly, doesn't mean you get to take them away from everyone.That's not what I said. There are very valid privacy concerns especially with so much data being stolen by online criminals. But this statement linked by the op is incorrect. > statement linked by the op is incorrect."
"The statement isn't about innocent people being arrested, it's about hurt. There are many ways that breaking encryption comes back to hurt the very people government is said to represent. From economic impacts, to social, and onwards."
"Who cares about criminals stealing data when the government is stealing so much more data as to make criminal efforts appear comicalCould you provide a link for more info on that case? It sounds like you're exemplifying small scale incidents to support a decision of societal scale. Who wants to talk? ;)"

"-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----Well that was annoying. The problem is of course authenticity :)The circlejerk is strong here on Reddit. How about a more nuanced, realistic take: Encryption has both good and bad consequences, as does government surveillance."
"I'll take my downvotes right here, tyvm.Since when did Apple Care about common folk?[deleted]> Until Apple goes open source they cannot be trusted no matter what they say."
"You'll be down voted to hell, but your right.Their programming language Swift is open source, among what others have said."
"Anyway, they'll probably open source OS X and iOS as soon as Microsoft open sources Windows and Windows Phone OS. Which is to say never.Based on your comments here the best thing I can suggest for you is to not use any technology. I don't know what you do on your computer that makes you so paranoidYour downvotes confirm it. Apple. You will die a slow and beautiful death. You used to be good. And then you turned that gold into shit. That is some accomplishment. You can't seriously be suggesting that the largest computer company open source everything. That makes no business sense at all. No company would do that. Companies open source things that they don't mind competitors having.opensource.apple.comTheir OS kernels have been open-sourced from the get-go, and they recently open sourced their crypto library."
"https://developer.apple.com/cryptography/That's right. Hate on one of the few companies that's publicly opposing this fucking insanity. That will make things turn out right! Step 1: Be Apple CEO  "
"Step 2: Say Something obvious  "
"Step 3:???  "
"Step 4: random person gets karma.  It's hard to believe Tim Cook could be so naive. Attempts to weaken encryption are part of a strategy for eventual political profiling so that this society of the rich can identify and detain people who oppose their agenda.Yes, created by the illuminati. Maybe, just maybe, his message was to the public, not to the people who know this. You can be sure that anybody who uses the word folks in a public forum is a sociopath.Built in back doors at hardware level in processors? if an apple ceo said you put 1 and 1 together and you get 2, someone would be highlighting this quote as a notable observation from the apple ceo.Apple not being evil? What? "
"Serious propsSame thing with the second amendment right to keep and bear arms."
"I am surprised that it took liberals this long to figure it out finally. Actually, it's funny you say that.  There's a rare but horrible virus that I've run across while fixing people's computers."
"Basically, it infects through an innocuous file and encrypts every single data file in your OS in 2048 bit asynchronous encryption.  Then, it says that it will delete the encryption key if you don't pay them $500 or $1000 in bitcoins within 6-12 months of infection.  It provides instructions on how to purchase bitcoins, how to pay them, and how to use TOR in case their site is blocked."
"So amusingly, his statement is not completely true.  Encryption is already absurdly strong as-is.  Honestly, there's not much you can do to actively weaken it.  2048 asynchronous can encrypt 1 GB/s under virtually unbreakable encryption.  Is there even a point in entertaining the notion that it could be weakened or broken in some way without the public key?  Brute forcing the key would take millions of years lol.  At that point, the only weakness of encryption is the human element.Except even if us non bad actors don't have that level of encryption, the bad guys will still find it because *somebody somewhere* will ignore the laws and create stronger encryption. So your entire scenario doesn't even play out any differently.I fail to believe he really gives a shit given that Apple work for the intelligence servicesPlease, please don't downvote me because I do believe privacy is very important and shouldn't be compromised. But I cannot be a hypocrite and accept this reasoning because it's the exact same logic that gun nuts use to argue for looser gun laws. Banning guns hurts the good guys because the bad guys will still know where to go to get them anyways.the differences in these arguments are many"
"not everyone uses a gun in their daily lives. in fact, 99% of people do not. however, everyone uses encryption in their daily lives, whether or not they know it. they only reason a guy sitting in grand central/times square with a wifi sniffer can't collect millions of credit card number is because of encrypted network connections. weakening the encryption used on these networks would be a serious attack vector that would make everyone vulnerable to these attackers."
"additionally, there is a significant skill gap between the average gun criminal vs the average cyber criminal. anyone using encryption in a nefarious manner is smart enough to simply not use government-broken encryption. so the ban is essentially worthless."
"people who acquire guns for nefarious purposes do not need any exceptional skill or knowledge to do harm with them, but acquiring an illegal firearm is an actual challenge that may dissuade the average dumb criminal.Well you can argue that banning guns still makes it harder for gun nuts to obtain guns. And for guns, it's not just 'bad guys' who are the problem. A lot of accidents are caused by innocents owning guns, police carrying guns, kids taking guns to school, mentally ill people; these people are not in the category of 'terrorists', they are not necessarily the people would still know where to get a gun."
"The same is not true for privacy. Encryption is extremely easy, banning it makes no ounce of difference to the difficulty of encrypting messages for those 'bad guys'. > But I cannot be a hypocrite and accept this reasoning because it's the exact same logic that gun nuts use"
"So you don't agree with it because it sounds similar to an argument about another completely unrelated topic? That's some terrible logicIt's really not, if an argument isn't valid, it isn't valid. Context is irrelevant in socratic method.What an incredible generalisation So what reasoning do you use to stop the government from abusing its power?That's kinda the point.  When everyone uses PGP, it's really hard to sift through all that info and find the bad guys.  If only criminals use PGP, then you just find PGP users and you know you're going to find something in their ranks quickly and efficiently.If Encryption is removed from the face of the earth then what happens to those emails sent from the US to China that negotiate a way to crush the Russian economy forcing them to beg the US for help?

"That email is now free for anyone and everyone to read.  "
"How about those communications which could be so secret hidden from the public for years and years which has now been stolen by some 14 year old hacktivist proving that Bush ordered Bin Laden to blow up the towers then thought shit we need someone to blame and cover my ass... Saddam/Osama did it!.  "
"I hope the government understands that if they remove encryption all their stuff could effectively be laid bare to the public and any other nation intent on digging up some secrets to force politicians  in to bend over backwards to help avoid tax etc...  "
"Ask yourselves this? Are you fully prepaid to disclose every last moment of your life online? Are you willing to show that saucy text you just sent your wife to the public?  "
"Well thanks for the downvote. Maybe explain why?Theres already backdoors in Apple products just for the NSA. "
"Call it *conspiracy* until the next Ed Snow if you want.  Prove it? You're saying the NSA can break AES? No there aren't. And how exactly would you know?They aren't *direct* backdoors made specifically or in conjunction with the NSA. But just like MS, they often leave known vulnerabilities in their software, and share that information so that they can put their hands up in the air should something come back around. This is what we call the 3 way hand shake. it's funny that is's the apple CEO who's saying this."
"since apple product are known for their good security.If that's sarcasm, they actually are pretty good with security.Its crazy how people think encryption protects them, the NSA controls so many nodes they can middleman any password they want no problemo.How?? What good people need encryption the government cant access when the person is under arrest... ya know, for nothing. I dont need to encrypt my bank info, or my WoW login info, or my credit card statements, or my SIN number, or like whatever the hell else people think they need to encrypt. "
"Can anyone give me some examples of non-tinfoil-hat things people legitimately  need to encrypt that arent incriminating? medical records, banking information, sensitive business documents, legal correspondence, personal familly issues, Tax info, basically anything you wouldn't want to paste to your front window for everyone to see"
"think of anything you would mail that you wouldn't want to just write on the back of a postcard (which anyone can read and roughly equates to an unencrypted message).Naw, thats hardly comparable. "
"A) There is no post man delivering my emails by hand and for some reason curious of my personal business. "
"B) Why do you have your medical records / digital medical records?"
"C) Why do you have your banking information on a computer? "
"D) Sensitive Business documents almost works, except any company with business documents worth looking at have an internal network and business infrastructure. Not personal use. "
"E) Your criminal record is accessible by anyone who wants to know. And its not like they email you your charges... so this isnt even a real thing."
"F) Personal family issues falls under the mailman thing. "
"G) Assuming you do your own taxes and would have that on your computer, uh who would give a shit? What are they gonna do with that info? Not to mention the flawed logic there. If someone is taking an interest in you enough to hack your computer/phone then they already know you make money. They arent going to hack you and be like oh man, tax info! This looks interresting!!. "
"People mail almost everything you listed above *every day*. Legal documents, tax info, bank information, business documents, and *especially family issues*. Medical Records are probably the only thing shared digitally, and even then you get your health card in the mail. "
"The only thing anyone encrypts are nude pics, and assuming you have them legally then there are much better ways to hide them. Look man I gave you a good answer I don't have to make you accept itThats true, but my reply wasnt so much for you as for anyone who reads it. But thanks for the answer, even if I disagree. privacy isn't about what you have **to hide** it's about deciding what you want **to share**Wording something to sound dramatic doesn't change the reality of the topic. The average person doesn't encrypt shit and they're fine. The only thing strong encryption protects are criminals. "
"Also, you're computer is fine. You a aren't important enough to worry about it. If it da real concern people wouldn't have had to brute force celebrities iTunes passwords to leak their nudes. "
"Gotta be realistic about this. He also said  The PC is dead. You shouldn't necessarily listen to this guy. "
"Not that I'm for weakening encryption...Well, yes, that's marketing. He's not going to say Windows is doing amazing! as CEO of Apple.It's such a shame Tim Cook of all people has to say this. Apple is pure evil, I don't want them making sense.leave and never return please."
"how is he evil?It's Apple. They're the closest thing to a real-life SPECTRE. Why do you even ask?Just because Apple products are generally sold at quite a high price and are very closed doesn't mean that they're evil.That is *exactly* what makes them evil.Evil, or just unappealing to you? Because I don't see any problem with selling those items unless they have a monopoly, which they obviously don't.wow nerdittors praising Apple.. next step: cops for doing their jobOh please, Tim Cook is just pandering like politician.  something something something ANDROID IS LUITERALLY HEAVEN AND APPLLE IS OUT TO RAPE YOU.The government needs to make strong encryption illegal. There really is no need to have strong encryption unless you have something to hide, i.e. criminal/terrorist intent. Also, by forcing weak encryption, this allows intelligence/law enforcement agencies the ability to more easily discern between legal and illegal activities. Terrorists/criminals will continue to use strong encryption and this will make them more easy to track.Weak encryption doesn't just let the good guys in; it lets the bad guys in as well. That's the problem. If you pass laws that say nobody's allowed to lock their doors so police have easier access, criminals have easier access as well.That is a small price to pay to prevent another 9/11 or something even worse. Also, the government having more access to data will make it easier, not harder, to capture the criminals you are talking about. Weakening encryption can only be a net positive overall so it is a good trade off.Weakening encryption can only be a net positive"
"So you're okay with anyone being able to read your credit card number when you make a transaction?  I don't understand. There are many types of information that I'd like to keep secure."
"I do have something to hide: my money from criminals accessing my online banking. And if that happens, you can easily get your money back, but if another 9/11 happens or worse because terrorists can easily communicate over any network, then those lives lost can't come back. Also, government having more access to data will make it easier to capture criminals stealing your information, not harder.I hate Apple, but just this once...amen.Coming from Apple, this is hilarious. What? Apple seems to be the only one standing up against the government for encryption. While other tech companies (i.e. Google and Microsoft) are being very quiet about it. apple wants end to end so they can control you like they do all there users"
"Well by that reasoning I guess my bank controls me because I use https...>Apple CEO: If you halt or weaken encryption, the people that you hurt are not the folks that want to do bad things. It's the good people. The other people know where to go."
"What about the good people, for some reason or another, are about to do bad things?"
"They make up the majority."
"People are not born hardened seasoned criminals, they are made."
"The governments reasons for snooping is to stack the deck in their favor, to catch the newly Breaking Bad types before they reign a lot of destruction."
"I don't mind the government snooping because the government works on the rule of law. What I don't like is when corporate leaders feel they also can do the same thing, profit by it and in the meanwhile blow a lot of hot air about how they are defending their users when in reality they are not."
"Like Tim Cook is really going to throw in for all the users and allow potential terrorists a means to communicate without their encryption being broken. Yea, right. "
"And since one cannot tell the good from the bad guys, or when the good guys turn bad, then everyone gets snooped on regardless."
"I would be just glad if Tim Cook would stop all the Apple spying and tracking that Apple is doing themselves without the governments intervention, it's not like they need the money."
"Innocent until proven guilty is an decidedly American tenant. Not only are you assuming people to be guilty before providing any evidence, you're already willing to knowingly violate the rights of more innocents to find this evidence. It's people like you who will bring about the police state. "
"Better hope you never disagree with the government, or piss of a rich guy.  maybe some evidence happens to find its way onto your computer. It's really that easy. We found child porn on his PC.  And you just disappear. "
"And you're *asking* for this. Why? Because of the one in a million chance you'll get shot by a drug dealer or a terrorist? Your more likely to drown in your bathtub, or die falling down the stairs. These enemies of yours are imaginary."
"I assume this means your for banning all guns? And for outlawing personal cars, soda, cigarettes and beer?>I don't mind the government snooping"
"Just think of the time when the people in power are not the ones you agree with, and how they can use and manipulate your data to make you conform. it sucks that people like you existThis guy is a frequent contributor to r/applesucks. I think we can safely say he's not looking at the situation very objectively.Probably an nsa shill :p"
"Apple CEO Tim Cook directly responds to court order requiring decryption of San Bernardino shooter's iPhone> And while the government may argue that its use would be limited to this case, there is no way to guarantee such control."
"This is the single most important point in this whole debate. There is absolutely no guarantee and furthermore, access by unauthorized parties becomes a function of time.Similar to the gun debate in that regard.A government actor could, instead of getting Apple to create a compromised version of iOS, obtain the Apple source code and signing key and do it themselves. Getting the source code would be straightforward--all they need is a spy working there. Getting the signing key might be a bit harder, but with the resources of the U.S. government, it sure seems possible."
"Same goes for any company that has source code. It's not *that* difficult to obtain. Hell, the source code for Windows is out in the wild--I bet the source code for iOS is obtainable, too.I mean, there probably is (in some capacity) an internal code repository at Apple. I'd wager it's *extremely* locked down from everyone that doesn't need access, possibly encrypted in the same way that iMessages are, so only the engineers working on the project can access the code for it.They would still need to install that software on the phone which requires the phone to be decrypted prior to the installation. Apple should build a device to beat their own encryption, let the feds use it just this one time with the supervision of Apple, then after they get what they need Tim Cook will simply type in his own name, and the machine will self destruct and catch on fire The modern iPhones all use full disk encryption, where the access to the flash chip goes through a chip that is needed to decrypt the flash memory. If I am not mistaken, this is also the chip that would wipe the memory if the wrong password is entered too many times. The flash memory is AES256 encrypted with a key burned in, in the factory. In other words, not even the owner of the phone knows this particular key. That is why you can't simply move the flash memory from one device to another, and then keep using it."
"So that device you are talking about, would need to break AES256. That would not be feasible for the near future, unless they are in possesion of severely advanced quantum computers, or a lot of time. Or they could to extract the key from a most likely tamper resistent chip.It was a joke referencing The Dark Knight movie where Batman makes that machine that can eavesdrop on everyone in the city and Lucias is against it I'm confused now - if that is the case, how would creating a new iOS which removes some security features gain them access to the data, presumably you still need both keys to get to the data?"
"*edit* ok the BBC says they only want to be able to guess the passcodes without the risk of the flash being erased. And then Gotham will be saved. "
"And... I am pretty sure they are not liable if you are compromised. Plus their phones become a ***lot*** more vulnerable to a brute-force attack.Unlikely? I guarantee that the government/courts will apply this again, to the point that in 10 years, it's routinely used in things like divorce cases. Doubt me? Look at what has happened with car black boxes and cell phone gps information. It would be another stingray. It would be commonly used, clearly illegal, but used in a way that makes it unchallengeable. Scope creep...  Back doors and internet filters both..Isn't the phone the property of the county, as it was a work phone? So Apple is refusing the owners request here. The county authorized the FBI to help here.I look at this as the soccer mom debate point. They think some power of the government will only be used in a case like this, then ignore how it's abused for every run of the mill drug investigation and more. I wonder if the person making that argument actually believes that bullshit or is just a evil lying sack of shit.Kind of makes you think of the atomic bomb. Terrifying.It's also absurd since there is no evidence that any event the Federal government has expanded it's authority claiming it was for a single emergency has ever been given up and almost always used again.  I hate to be brutal here but the Fed's are liars.  Always have been.  Maybe it's not their intention to be so but they are making promises they know good and well they can't and behind closed doors would say they have no desire to keep.If there is one thing the government, particularly its intelligence agencies, have shown time and time again, it's that given the opportunity, they will abuse *any* privilege they are granted for any ends they see fit."
"I am as absolutely certain as the sun will rise each morning that if this tool is provided to them, it will be abused in a matter of hours. I can't imagine it being more than a couple of years before the tool is in the hands of everyone from the FBI down to the small town police station and it becomes a normal part of day to day policing. Arrest someone for drink and disorderly? Confiscate their phone and go fishing for something."
"This is law enforcement's wet dream and the likelihood of them behaving themselves with it is somewhere between 0 and none."
"This response is what happens when you spend decades abusing the trust of the people and then have the nerve to say trust us. Given the lack of oversight and accountability of these organisations, I think it safe to say they have no reason as to why they *should* be trusted.> access by unauthorized parties becomes a function of time"
"So does the likelihood that an FBI agent gets turned by a foreign government. "
"You'll be surprised what threatening family or giving a few million will do to a person.The FBI can't keep it's personelle records safe from"
"China, does anyone believe they could keep this secret from China? Especially now that they know said magic bullet might be made?Is it the most important?  I'd say that not only is it *not* the most important point, but it's a bad one to make the most important point.  Even if they could make a magical guarantee, they are still wrong.  "
"When we say things like but you can't guarantee... then the conversation becomes about how they can try to make said guarantee or at least be able to to convince you of said guarantee.  It shifts the goal posts and creates misinformation for the many people out there that are not too familiar with the concept of encryption.  A trustworthy government has no more right to this as an untrustworthy one. "
"Encryption is encryption and nobody, include the government, has any special right for secret ways to break it.  It undermines freedom.  It undermines security.  It undermines the entire Information Age.  It's as simple as that.  "
"This may happen but in my opinion the real problem will be that with all the hassle they'll possibly go back to making less secure phones. Then they can just unlock them next time."
"But if they do the authorities will continue to ask them to unlock every phone they seize from then on. So, Apple can't win either way. Damned if you do, damned if you don't."
"All it is essentially is the gov harassing a technology company regardless of which solution they offer.> All it is essentially is the gov harassing a technology company regardless of which solution they offer."
"And doing it publicly so as to either shame the company or gain public support. As my security professor once told us, it's not a matter of what are the chances. It's a matter of when.Not just a matter of can't guarantee, it seems *hilariously* unlikely that this won't immediately lead to the same request every time they find a device they think is interesting, and shortly after that it'll end up in the hands of third parties. I think you mean "
"Contractors"
"Then, a few years later local cops ala stingrays.You're absolutely correct.  Eventually, the technology to brute force phones would be sold to local PD's by a private company.  Hell, it will probably just be an upgrade on a [UFED] (http://www.cellebrite.com/Mobile-Forensics/Solutions/ufed-pro-series), which many local departments already have."
"Source: Retired Detective - and have used these types of devices.Yep. Cellebrite is notorious for this. To my knowledge none of them work on recent iOS or Apple hardware.Cellebrite sure makes it seem like they're a handy, helpful corporation - except their sole reason for existing is violating human rights and invading privacy."
"The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) supports Apple's position:"
"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/02/eff-support-apple-encryption-battleI like the message, but how do we verify that Apple upholds Cook's promise? "
"I know this might sound like conspiracy gobble, but for all we know, this public address could be a publicity stunt to cover up the opposite and garner trust in Apple as a defender of privacy."
"Secret courts and gag orders are thing.We can't know. But by writing this open letter, Apple is shining a light on the attacks on privacy by the US government, ones that are even more personal than the Snowden leaks.Because right now they could say they've been ordered by a court and must comply, but instead they're having their lawyers fight it in court, which costs them money and risks them getting bad PR-- you know Fox News will paint them as terrorist lovers. It's government vs. big business. Fox News might be more sympathetic than you expect.Just donated to the EFF and I urge other redditors to do the same. They've been fighting for our freedoms for a very long time.I feel like anyone sane and remotely knowledgeable supports Apple's position."
"But in seriousness, it is good to see another organization speak out in support.Wow. Major props to standing up for what you believe in, even at the behest of your own government. All I can hope for is that other tech companies will stand in solidarity with Apple.Lol, it's marketing.They can afford it. They do have more money than the government after all. A bum on the street has more money than government when you consider debt.  Remember that when they want to raise taxes.I'm sorry but I can't take you seriously when you make a comparison like that. "
"I get what you're trying to do but it's not coming across like you want it to. Indeed! Not all companies would stand up like this. The reply Apple has given makes me proud to be their customer. What if Apple is just making a stand against this publicly, but actually willingly complies anyway? He needs to be willing to step forward as the one saying no when the contempt of court talk starts.  Be willing to sit in jail for a little bit as the CEO of the world's most recognizable company to make a point.  I think this would go away.He should have linked the apple 1984 big brother ad after his name.I don't understand this though. It seems like other tech companies like Yahoo, Google, and even Apple were forced to hand over metadata etc. How is Apple, who once spied on their own customers via the iPhone suddenly standing up to the feds on this? It seems inconsistent.You act like our government  doesn't do shit all the time to fuck people over... You can certainly count out Google and the NSA."
"http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/5/6/nsa-chief-google.htmlEverytime Cook brings this up though we don't hear a peep from either MSFT or Alphabet. It'd be nice if the 3 big companies stood together.This was nearly 2 years ago (the story), and it says they had email exchanges and a relationship with the NSA _before_ the Snowden revelations. Apparently, Google was under the impression the NSA were the good guys and were helping in terms of technology. NOT in just wholesale turning over everyone's information to the NSA. "
"After Snowden and Google finds out just what the hell the NSA was doing, including hacking into their own networks, they were pissed:"
"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131106/00235225143/pissed-off-google-security-guys-issue-fu-to-nsa-announce-data-center-traffic-now-encrypted.shtml"
"Also, Google has been one of the few companies that have actually gone to court over the National Security Letters they get from the FBI. Hey, blame Google for looking at searchs for vibrators that play o cum all ye faithful all you want. But they don't want governments prying into everyone's business either. "
"And also, this:"
"http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-now-requires-full-device-encryption-on-new-android-6-0-devices/"
"Remember, Android isn't like Apple. Google didn't have total control over devices and software. Manufacturers like HTC, Samsung and Motorola can take their software and then do whatever they want to with it...including choosing not to encrypt them by default. With 6.0 though, Google is requiring it and their trying to gain more control.There's nothing there suggesting Google is any more willing to provide backdoor access to Android devices. Apparently to you just speaking to the NSA is criminal. You must have missed the bit in Tim's letter where he stated that up until this point they have been cooperating with the FBI and have provided all the data they have access to.I mean, I don't think they really have a choice in the matter to talk to the Feds if it's court mandated... Very different than willful cooperation. Are t most android phones unencrypted because it's software encryption which was too resource heavy? Therefore they wouldn't need a back foot to hack into the phone. Pretty much any Android phone can be encrypted, easily. From Android 6.0 on, the encryption is on by default. And the performance boost you get disabling it is in the range of not humanly perceptible."
"At least, that's the case on high end phones. I guess that with 80EUR toy phones, it might be a whole different story. "
"The high-end devices most likely all have hardware acceleration for the encryption used, so the performance hit will be negligible.Thats because all new phones will need to have a hardware encryption chip installed so that it no longer bogs down the software.My brain just moved Apple from the Fuck You bin to the Good Guy bin.Superficially I agree wholeheartedly with you, but in this instance that is only because Apple's interests align with ours.  On another issue this could be an example of a corporation acting against the will of the people's government in order to protect its own interests."
"I don't know what I find more scary: that a corporation can wield this much power; that it takes an entity with the power and profile of Apple to stand up to the government; or that the government's agenda is so diametrically opposed to the needs of the people it represents.Apple's power was given to it by _us_, and we could take it away in a product cycle. What's more inherently democratic than that?Product cycles are even more frequent than election cycles. I like where this is headed...The amount of money they have... It would take more than a product cycle to lose that power.A democracy. I'm not yet ready to fully transition to a corporate Republic Well if Apple felt it would lose their customers by opposing this then they wouldn't do it. Ironically we're actually seeing corporations representing our interests better than the elected government officials, because the corporation is financially motivated to do so. The government is acting in the best interests of itself and the country, not it's people.I always thought that a country was it's people...THAT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE SOMETHING A TRUE PATRIOT WOULD SAY!Oh you sweet summer child.Thank you, Tim Cook!"
"Maybe the FBI should have been more thorough at the suspect's apartment instead of leaving shredded documents, and volumes of other material behind and Letting the media storm the apartment. Were they just being lazy or something?Apple has many faults, but the thing that I admire most about the company is its stance on encryption and data security. Even the recent news on Error 53 if a third-party Touch ID Home button is used on an iPhone highlights their focus on security; controversial as bricking the device is, it definitely prevents any compromised fingerprint sensors from accessing and storing fingerprint data. I hope Apple will continue to fight the efforts of out-of-touch politicians and overreaching government agencies like the FBI to weaken encryption, which no doubt is used by the government itself to protect its own secrets. "
"Much more about iOS security in [Apple's white paper.](https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf)To be fair, encryption and security have only become larger issues for Apple within the past couple years. The article is referring to the user pin code on the phone itself, not transmitted data. Messaging to and from Apple devices can still be accessed by the government as it passes through cell networks, from what we know."
"The change in messaging, I think, has more to do with ripping support from public-sector BlackBerry contracts. BlackBerry data is encrypted locally and is not accessible by the government while traversing a network. It is the reason why BlackBerry is banned in India and China, as they have refused to allow government decryption. They are still the go-to smartphones for the public sector in every single developed country, and those are contracts that Apple wants its phones on."
"Apple is playing catch-up on the only remaining field that it doesn't have an edge over BlackBerry, and that is data security. I'm glad that it is finally being taken seriously, as I'm an iPhone user myself.I also support and applaud Apples stance, but lets not put a halo on them and call them revolutionaries fighting for our freedom."
"A very large part of this stand comes from a twofold self interest. "
"Firstly as a commercial enterprise in personal communications, it is a massive value drop to be told publicly that your data and conversations cannot be considered secure. A publicly acknowledged backdoor will mean that anyone with the right security clearance,and the right black market channels has unlimited access to any ones data, be it of commercial, personal or criminal nature. "
"Try selling that on TV and billboards with bright primary colours."
"Secondly, given the huge amount of public data dumps stolen recently, Apple are wise enough to know that by drastically weakening the publics expected security, they drastically weaken themselves. Large companies from Ashley Madison to Sony know they are primary targets in the encryption wars."
"Thankfully for us, Apples economic survival depends having access to exactly the level of security the pubic needs and deserves.It makes zero sense to brick the device when they could just disable the touch ID feature instead.  Which is exactly what they do UNTIL you update the device.   Then they brick it.  They only care about your security until you update it.   "
"Your comment makes no sense.  Their argument is if someone were to create an unofficial device which plugs into the wire where the one button connects and brute force access to a stolen phone. all they need to do is open up the phone and connect their device (pre-iOS 9.2.1) and boom they have access.  Now they can no longer do that as home buttons have an authenticity check which a 3rd party device (home button brute forcer) would fail."
"Simply disabling the Touch ID means that the system falls back on the less secure method a key code.  which could be beaten by trying 99,999 times if the user doesn't set the phone to erase itself after 10 tries and erasing itself still doesn't stop the bad guys from selling the phone."
"It is still better to brick a stolen phone than to allow the bad guys access to stored passwords which may include bank accounts or personal information.  "
"Apple should unbrick currently bricked devices allowing them to return to older versions of iOS, but still keep the bricking functionality moving forward (including blocking users with modified phones from future software upgrades)."
"It's simply too hard to create a grandfather clause for phones with unofficial home buttons because eventually bad guys find a way to use that clause to allow them to connect and use a brute force device.I've argued this point *dozens of times* in the past week so I'm going to up vote your negative post in the hopes others see this reply: "
"The TL:DR is the nature of the fingerprint sensor involves trusted access to something called the secure enclave. A modified device could pull not just your fingerprint data but the MASTER KEY derived from your passcode + UDID used to write the AES-256 scrambled data to NAND storage. "
"Basically, it could fuck you. Nobody in the security world was mad about this. It was absolutely, 100% the right call to do and awesome for Apple to even have this kind of security at all.They don't take this stance because they believe in privacy. Just like Microsoft they will stand by it as long as it's profitable."
"I'm not saying it's a bad thing, just remember that it's because of money, not principles.Apple has always been about privacy. "
"http://youtu.be/39iKLwlUqBoAnd it's the same with Google, etc. They're companies, meant to make a profit. But what you're missing is that companies need to be founded on principles in order to be an organization at all. Because if profit is their 100% sole motivator then there's plenty of other industries they could be in or things to sell. I was gong to say, all of a sudden the Touch ID debacle makes a lot more sense. Originally it was cast as apples war against 3rd party repair companies, and while that's a side effect, it was likely an action they took in response to the security concern. > controversial as bricking the device is, it definitely prevents any compromised fingerprint sensors from accessing and storing fingerprint data."
"So that's what it was? Have a source for that? Couldn't find it in your link. Because that would make infinitely more sense than them just locking out third party repairs (while they don't brick devices for third party repairs on other parts of their phones). Somehow must've missed that during the outrage back then."
"EDIT: found one myself: http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/06/apple-says-iphone-error-53-is-to-protect-customers-securityWell, that's because when it comes to Apple and Reddit, outrage outruns facts by several hundred miles an hour. >  Even the recent news on Error 53 if a third-party Touch ID Home button is used on an iPhone highlights their focus on security; "
"but that was only after you ran an update, so why not make the update query the Home button and refuse to install if it does not come back as working correctly followed by a message telling the person to go get their device serviced by a Apple certified tech?Because people wouldn't so it's still a security weakness and its still Apple who get the blame when security is breached. The most secure thing in the world is a box you cannot open. "
"I'm sure if you asked lots of people would they prefer an insecure phone that they can get the data off till they are able to get it repaired properly vs a secure phone that will never work again, they will opt for the former. "
"That would completely defeat its purpose as a security measure. Like it or not, the way to make it work correctly would be to make it brick instantly as it turns on. "
"My preferred fix would be instantly just lock the phone so it can only be wiped at reinstalled or unlocked by Apple. Self destruct the data, not the hardware.Not even brick the device. Just refuse to decrypt data on the device and display a message that bad hardware has been installed, please visit an Apple Store to get it fixed. > My preferred fix would be instantly just lock the phone so it can only be wiped at reinstalled or unlocked by Apple"
"My preferred fix is bricking it. Otherwise it's possible for someone to tamper with my phone, wipe it, and then trick me to restore from backup and continue using the phone without noticing that it's no longer secure."
"> That would completely defeat its purpose as a security measure. "
"no, you don't expect protection from an update that you don't already have installed. The bricking for security was a facet of the new update "
"Therefore doing a check (will this update immediately brick the device) is the sane thing to do prior to installing the update because at that point the user has no reason to expect that level of security. The whole point of the security enclave is that it destroys the part of itself that holds the key, making it resistant to tampering. Apple specifically cut the Jtag connectors to the chip so it cannot be read or written to externally - the chip destroying itself in case of unauthorised scanner being used is just a fantastic security measure, really that's how security should be done.If I understand it correctly, this was because the security hole was fixed in the new update. Previous versions of the OS did not check for this. Yep, the idea behind it is good, but how Apple executed this is just a huge middle finger to its customers.Coupled with their history of not being friendly to third party repair, it does imply a certain anti-competitiveness, whether intentional or not.Well, do you think it is unfair for Apple to assume that a piece of hardware that they installed in the device is present on that device? Especially since that particular device contains an encryption key.I think if an update has the ability to render a device inoperable if one of the parts is missing or broken it should check that part before allowing the update to be applied. What he said"
"That, or show a message every once in a while warning the user of the issue and, in short, explain what could happen and that bringing it in a shop could fix itTin foil hat time: What if Apple purposefully made their reaction to third party tampering severe to garner more attention toward encryption?As a privacy- and security-minded iPhone user I for one am very glad that they responded to that situation as they did. It was a gaping security hole and reacting as they did closed it securely. Had they not patched it hacking into any iPhone would simply require physical access for long enough to replace the Touch ID sensor."
"Edit: Added the previously-omitted words iPhone user.Yes, I too am glad that they didnt bend to the attempt at trying to exploit emotions in order to pressure them to bend to their will. Perhaps bricking the Touch ID functionality and not the entire fucking phone would have been smart.I know where you're coming from, but no, that would not have been smart. Secure systems will always come at the cost of convenience. "
"Whether we're talking about the convenience of being able to replace the Touch ID sensor in an unauthorized way or the convenience of being able to gain access to your phone for mass surveillance, more security will always come with side effects that make certain things less convenient, almost by definition.Perhaps reading the white paper and understanding the intricacies of the crypto system would have been smart. If you'd have done that you'd know such a thing isn't possible and would create unnecessary vulnerabilities. Security comes whole or not at all, there are no compromises in cryptography.And having access to the device to further tamper with the software til you figure out how to override touchID being disabled or entering new info about the component you just installed"
"Just because you don't understand something entirely and can curse on the internet about it, doesn't make you right "
"Trust in the people more educated then you fighting for your security Trusting other people to look after your security is exactly the wrong message...So you're gonna make your own phone hardware and software independently? You're gonna defend your home from military take over? "
"It's easy to act like you're capable of anything on your own when you've relied on everyone for your protection up to posting that comment How would bricking touch-id, and requiring The user to Enter Their passcode instead, be a Security problem?You're just thinking about yourself, ignoring all the government and military contracts Apple has. This is not about you.  Chances are you don't even own their phone. Apparently, It didn't work in the iPhone because the passcode was managed by the same hardware as the touchID. This was a change made in the iPhone 6 and continues. > Trust in the people more educated then you fighting for your security"
"isn't this ironic?"
"It would be if he was claiming to be more educated, but I don't believe he is!Indeed, because trust itself is not a secure mechanism of humanity.Its not as simple as Apple standing up for what they believe in. Apple is an international company which tries to sell in every market it can. If the FBI can get a back door into iOS that means two very bad things for American tech companies."
"1. The American government now has a backdoor in every iPhone sold world wide. Apple couldn't limit this just to the ones they sell in the US because then all one would need to do to get around this is by a phone from another market. No one likes the idea of a foreign government having access to their information. This would seriously hurt American businesses as non-Americans would be much more inclined to use alternatives or create their own competing devices."
"2. Now every government world wide can demand their own back doors. It becomes a logistical nightmare of keeping track of who can and who can't have access. Going back to point one how would Americans like it if the Russian government demanded Apple give them a back door to all Apple devices?Not only that, but if someone could exploit the system *they* would have access to that data as well. Three Secretaries of State have used unsecured servers to store official (work) emails. I can only imagine wtf they've got in their unofficial (non-work provided) phones. Or their spouses, or children. A fence is only as strong as its weakest link. It'd be silly to think those people aren't targets for attack. Another thing to consider, if they weaken security, then organizations that use their device for secure communications would likely drop them. It has market share implications as well. He has to be diplomatic in his message I suppose. But we all know for a fact that the FBI, NSA and quite possibly your local police station would abuse the hell out of this backdoor, whenever it suits their purpose."
"The rules with regards to search and seizure aren't as well defined with newer forms of technology, especially data. Or even if they are it seems as if authorities do not seem to care as long as they can't be caught. Nor do they necessarily care since the courts are not even willing to hear any arguments against such search and seizure."
"FBI will abuse this backdoor(if built) every chance it gets.I'm not the most tech savvy, however that's been my argument the entire time. If Apple does this once, they'll be doing it a million times. What's worse is they're building something that could cause world havoc. Again I'm not the smartest however all this talk over Hillary having sensitive documents in her personal email? If there was a back door couldn't it be breached on her phone and those emails brought to light? All I know is at 36 years old I've seen the internet go from a general idea to having access to it in our pockets, there is a lot of information that can be found from our phones, over the internet, to the point where it's frightening. We can all give what ifs, but that's the problem, the only way we'll figure out how bad this can get is if it does. Man I kinda miss the 1980s. Even if the FBI won't abuse it, and that is a big if, it will be leaked eventually.Apple is also being singled out.  If they comply, they will become a pariah and their iPhone sales will bleed away to every other smart phone vendor who still has secure data."
"...or have the other vendors already happily complied?> FBI, NSA and quite possibly your local police station would abuse the hell out of this backdoor"
"The problem for politicians is that they can't or won't see that a backdoor of this type isn't just for the good guys. As we've all seen, it doesn't take long to spread the details of how to exploit the backdoor once they are discovered.> He has to be diplomatic in his message I suppose."
"He could have said nothing and embraced the government's wishes... The rules for search and seizure are plenty defined for everyone's private property regardless of technological advancements. Which is why civil forfeiture is a thing... > But we all know for a fact that the FBI, NSA and quite possibly your local police station would abuse the hell out of this backdoor, whenever it suits their purpose."
"They probably would, but that's not the primary issue. Consider that Apple are basically being asked to *build a way to circumvent their security measures and hand it over to a third party*. It is just insanity - I would be surprised also if it didn't violate their terms of service, thus making it illegal. I agree with you when it comes to Local PD. State level government is still a bit like the wild west where depending on locality, all sorts of shit can happen. Chris Christie shut down the busiest bridge in the country, Alabama jails a clean 75% of it's black male population. "
"But with regards to the federal government, it has to be considered that the FBI, CIA, etc. has enough information on you, the day you turned 18, to ruin your life had they chosen to. They are the ones who gave you your SS number after all. Society has, and will probably always be, a system where the people trust the government and the powers that be to do right by them and when that power is abused, there are measures to correct the issue, like voting. The nuclear option for the people, if the situation gets as bad as some doomsday say-ers claim, would be a full overthrow of government where total chaos ensues, much like the French Revolution or the Chinese cultural revolution. "
"Because of this, I personally do not think that a government accessing our online data, changes the fundamental basis of how society runs.  I am against the government having our data for personal privacy reasons, for instance, they don't need to know if I told my girlfriend I loved her today, but as far as that abuse of data for the sake of imprisoning the innocent... I believe it won't change those metrics. Whether or not the fed is competent enough to keep our data safe from the hands of hackers, and dangerous individuals is a whole other argument.Why hasn't a new amendment been ratified to match the new technology age? So many were ratified in the 100 years after the first singing, and signings have since tapered off into nothingness. The amendments need to be reexamine and new ones ratified to match the current age of the world.Because polarization. It's getting harder and harder to pass bills and everyone has different interests. Many Democrats and Republicans in Congress are actually pro surveillance. > FBI would abuse the hell out of this backdoor"
"Maybe. Maybe not."
"But you can bet your ass the NSA/CIA/rogue agents inside the FBI sure would.Rogue nsa agents in the FBI sounds like a good spy thriller book. That this might actually be true is terrifyingYes they would, the US gov has previous, they simply cannot be trusted.>>     FBI would abuse the hell out of this backdoor"
"> "
"> Maybe. Maybe not."
"Uh... what? The FBI is as bad as the NSA when it comes to violating rights and ignoring the constitution, they're just less capable."

"http://www.engadget.com/2015/12/08/fbi-says-it-uses-zero-day-exploits/Slippery slope argument. It is equal to how the patriot act was targeted at terrorist but has been primarily used for domestic surveillance. A thing that is intended for one purpose, unless clearly restricted to that purpose, leads to a slippery slope ever expanding purposes due to legal precedence.Its less a 'slippery slope' and more of a 'we're already at the bottom of the canyon'. The FBI and US Gov use any means available regardless of the constitution or due process already- this would just give them another tool.Even when it's clearly restricted, it still ends up in common usage otherwise.  People cannot be trusted with omnisciency.  Period.Or any hacker that gets an idea of how it works. This could then be used in any world wide government to spy and detain people fighting against a country. I could hack a CEO phone and start insider trading, or they could have some weirdo stalk women easily with this. There are so many bad scenerios that can happen with a backdoor that it's insane.Weirdo stalk girls? Like what has proven to be rampant among the NSA of agents using their powers to gain unlawful access to exes and people of their interest?That's the quiet story that shocks me the most. The amount of corporate espionage you could have control of and using it to play the  market or steal from other companies. China is doing it, who says others aren't either?I suggest everybody will have to install an additional door to their home with one master key, and this key will be given to the FBI. The key will also open any safe inside the house. Sometimes there's a need to search the house or even save people in it, and it's very difficult when the owner is not around. This way, the FBI will have access, to be used only in legitimate cases and truthfully, based on the good intentions of the agents. For our own good. Politicians and public figures are excluded. Unless they have something against the FBI, in which case this key will be used to get information that might shape their agenda and priorities. Again, for the public's benefit.And if FBI is busy then perhaps a private bailbondsman can do it for them on a retainer? Sounds safe and easy enough.Damn. Standing up for the privacy of millions in the wake of adversity by your own government. Gotta respect that move."
"U.S Government: *Please..*"
"Tim Cook: **Fuck You.**Yeah, I don't think the US govt would ever say please. It's usually, Do as I say, or else...Its like a gang half the timeApple: We have more money than you ...-5 years later-"
"READ ALL ABOUT IT! READ ALL ABOUT IT! APPLE AFTER  LOSING COURT CASE PURCHASES USA AND FIRES COURT!USA- United States of Apple**US Govt:** We hereby sentence you to-"
"**Apple:** Pssst, we are considering moving out of the U.S. completely."
"**US Govt:** -Innocent of all charges, go about your day.Moving to Iceland would be a hell of a threat! Iceland would be so happy about it. The risk is the US government then cracks down on 'imported' foreign-owned hardware to strike back.Now I understand why they have built new 'Spaceship' headquarters. If something goes wrong they just take off and start to pay taxes on any planet they want.That may be true, but what is the or else in this scenario? Apple is one of the few companies to have deep enough pockets to fight the US Gov in court. And i think they would stand a decent chance of winning, too.> And i think they would stand a decent chance of winning, too."
"Uh, they already lost....?"
"That's kind of the whole thing. This thread wouldn't exist if they had won. They lost, and they're saying don't care, still won't do itWell thankfully we have a fully functioning court system, including a Supreme Court ready to hear this potentially important case.  I mean think of what a mess it would be if we have a SC with an even number of justices...The appeal court decision will stand if the SC is split."
"And there is already somes cases were some SC judges recuse themselves and the number of justices is even."
"Furthermore it will take quite some time to reach the SC.I hope everyone finds solidarity with Apple on this subject. It's infuriating what the government wants to do.[According to wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Writs_Act) it appears it has previously been used to get a small cellphone manufacturer to create a backdoor.  It'll be interesting to see what difference it makes now that it's Apple.  They can actually defend themselves from the FBI."
"[On October 31, 2014, the act was used by the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York to compel an unnamed smartphone manufacturer to bypass the lock screen of a smartphone allegedly involved in a credit card fraud.](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7012457256018582034)Someone needs to craft a clever FOIA to get the name of that manufacturer.I am usually no fan of apple, but my opinion of them just soared.I agree! I have always disliked the the marketing scheme, overpriced hardware, and the ego that comes with Apple. However, they are standing up to the encryption. This alone gives me motivation to buy an apple product. These days I actually find the ego thing to be the opposite, with Android users tending to be the ones talking down to iPhone users instead of the reverse. Then again I never see anyone discussing this outside of the internet.> the ego "
"Let's be honest, the android master race is much worse. Honestly, I got an iPhone recently over it. Compared to android, this thing is secure as *fuck*. iMessage uses end to end encryption by default, Touch ID is used extensively, four digit pins just aren't good enough and are disallowed, apps cannot access your location without asking and rarely get access when the app isn't running, unlike android which asks you once before installing, and gives whatever away to them. Individual apps don't have unfettered access to the system and can only background for 15 minutes after closure (with a few exceptions such as audio).  It blows my mind how much better the idle battery drain is, probably because it doesn't let apps track you however they please constantly. Screen on battery life is equivalent to Android. "
"I don't know if I would have liked it nearly as much with older software releases, but it's got feature parity with android nowadays. If you want emulators and such, you can build and install them for free now, assuming you have a bit of technical knowledge and a Mac. That's pretty much the only thing that's tempted me to jailbreak. You can do things like replace the keyboard and stuff nowadays. They've done this since the FBI asked for unencrypted iMessages a few years backFrom the BBC:"
">**The FBI has asked Apple to do two things.**"
">**Firstly, it wants the company to alter Farook's iPhone so that investigators can make unlimited attempts at the passcode without the risk of erasing the data.**"
">**Secondly, it wants Apple to help implement a way to rapidly try different passcode combinations, to save tapping in each one manually.**"
">**The FBI wants to use what is known as a brute force attack, trying out every combination until stumbling across the correct one and unlocking the phone.**"
"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35594245"
"So it doesn't seem like Apple can unlock the phone for the FBI, but they can modify it to make the chances of breaking into it easier.i understand why the FBI wants the first one (not that i agree)"
"But the second one? Those lazy fuckers. its only 10000 combinations get one of your interns to do it.Because the key is destroyed after a few brute force tries and at that point it's impossible to recover.  They want a custom os that removes that so they can brute force it.Except point 1 bypasses the wipe after N failed attempts! Did you even read? You are like the 8th person to bring this up.Can the passcode be more than 4 digits though?Seriously, 20 tries per minute should be doable, that means after 1 workday you've tried all combinations."
"1 workday. You could find plenty of people to do this for $200 over a day or two (plus on average they'd only need to try 5K to find it)."
"Meanwhile they want some Apple engineers to actually spend time on this at a fully loaded cost of upwards of $1500 a day to make that software. It shouldn't be too hard, but even if the engineer needs to spend 4 hours on it that's considerably more than the $200 bucks. And this is IT, that 4 hour estimate is probably on the conservative side."
"It's just insane - probably even just the people involved on the request side, lawyers, officers, ... that had to vet, read and edit the second point would've cost more than paying the $200.They are probably thinking they are saving taxpayer's $200..."
"> its only 10000 combinations get one of your interns to do it.  "
"Well, they are asking to make it so they can try all 10000 if I understand it correctly. Currently the phone doesn't allow that and will disable itself after repeated failures"
"you see, the issue is that after repeated failures the phone will wipe itself,"
"which is point 1, to disable that to allow for multiple attempts with no wiping."
"Which means that given point 1, anyone can sit down, spend a day and try all possible combinations of 0000 to 9999. "
"which means that they dont really need the point 2 but they are asking for it."
"So i can only surmise that they are extremely lazy."
"But of course they are lazy. since they are here harassing people for the easy way out instead of going out, talking to people and doing actual investigative work. >which means that they dont really need the point 2 but they are asking for it.  "
"Ok, I never gathered that they specifically wanted that on top of 1. But I know if I were asking for 1 I would also ask hey, can you fix 2 as well while you are at it? so I guess it makes sense."
"Yea, they probably thinking that too since they were already breaking down the door, might as well raid the fridge too.It can wipe itself after 10 tries.which is what point 1 is for, so it doesn't wipe itself."
"with that, you dont need point 2, just sit down, and try from 0000 to 9999."
"but nah, these lazy people who hasn't done any real investigative work can't manage that, they need an easier method. Lazy Lazy Lazy. > But the second one? Those lazy fuckers. its only 10000 combinations get one of your interns to do it."
"Except most devices are set up to erase themselves after 10 failed attempts.Except point 1 bypasses the wipe after N failed attempts! Did you even read? You are like the 7th person to bring this up.Yeah but as far as I remember from when I had an iPhone it locks after 3 tries, locking the phone for 5 minutes and that 'locked time' increases every time, meaning after  another try you would have to wait half an hour, then an hour and so on. I can't remember when it caps out though.I imagine that was part of the first change, remove both time and attempt limits.Presumably a removal of that system is included in the first thing mentioned.Uhm.... iOS now supports alphanumeric passcodes. It takes a little by of digging to find (settings, touchid and passcodes, change passcode, passcode options) but it's there. "
"Trying to brute force that with manual entry would take multiple lifetimes. it is confirmed that the phone in question uses a 4 digit numeric lock."
"iphone 5C without any security enclave, nor the security features of iOS 8 and above.It would be funny if they gave them  the first one but not the second.morbidly so.The first one is the key to the whole thing though. Electronic inputs can be as fast as you want but as soon as you hit a certain number of wrong guesses, the thing times out or starts erasing data. If you take away the guess limit/time out, you've broken the entire thing. FBI goes through all this shit, 5 years of court proceedings and 3 different presidents, finally Apple is forced to build an unlocker firmware which they drag out for another 8 months. FBI drooling and rubbing their hands together. So much juicy info. Been waiting so long. Today's the day. Slide to unlock... ok it begins, this could take a while... first up:"
"1111"
"success>Rather than asking for legislative action through Congress, the FBI is proposing an unprecedented use of the All Writs Act of 1789 to justify an expansion of its authority."
"Seriously? THe FBI is using an act, made in a time long long before even the invention of electrical lamps, to justify their demand for Apple to create a backdoor into iPhones? "
"That is unbelievably, undeniably, stupendously ridiculous.The current version was actually first passed in 1911. And the message behind all writs has nothing to do with technology, so it's really the same as saying that someone is invoking the 10 commandments or the constitution. We didn't have cell phones or TVs or automobiles when the constitution was written, but we still abide by those laws even when they involve phones, TVs, and cars.  This is not even the first case of the all writs act being used to try and unlock cell phones to get information from a suspect."
"It seems it was successfully used in a credit card fraud (of all things) in 2014. https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7012457256018582034"
"And they were harping on Apple to do it in December of 2014, a year BEFORE San Bernardino, again bringing up all writs. http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/12/feds-want-apples-help-to-defeat-encrypted-phones-new-legal-case-shows/"
"This feels like an opportunity for the gov't to once again bring up the act so that they can get a master key. You have to wonder if the efforts just won't go away -- repeating themselves tragedy after tragedy -- until finally the backdoor exists once people become afraid enough of society to let the gov't buttfuck 'em once again.Its a matter of physical vs digital.  It is considered 100% normal and reasonable for the government to ask a safe manufacturer or locksmith to open a lockbox/safe.  Its considered sane and reasonable for a court to order someone to open there locked filing cabinet, or to acquire a mastery key to open the cabinet from its manufacturer."
"Yet when it comes to cellphones and in general digital documents people start losing there mind.  Its suddenly completely unreasonable to ask someone to unlock there cellphone, even with a court order.  Its suddenly completely unreasonable to approach the manufacturer to unlock a cellphone even with a court order.  Yet if that were a safe, filing cabinet, or lockbox people wouldn't even think twice about it.  "
"To this end encrypting your documents should not somehow grant immunity to prosecution, or make all information that was encrypted get thrown out of court.  "
"Yet by the same token, the government can't just walk in your house and open your safe, while theoretically with backdoors, artificial access, etc they could access your digital documents without ever notifying you directly or completely without your knowledge.  Doing that would obviously be illegal, but people still fear it anyhow.  "
"I know my opinion and points are not popular on reddit, but at the end of the day encrypted documents should legally be treated the same way as physical documents/items in a locked container.  "
"I disagree with you, but this is a well reasoned argument that I consider often. I genuinely think we would be as a net gross more safe if the Feds were given back door access to popular services. However, I think of encryption as more of a first amendment issue than anything. What is encryption but a language to store information? And then at that point, the fifth amendment should cover any argument to be forced to explain the language. Check out the Bernstein vs US and Hubbell vs US Supreme Court cases.  For a start, the courts are already able to force people to unlock their cellphones, just like they are able to force people to unlock their safes. "
"This is more like the Gov telling the biggest alarm manufacturers that all alarm systems must have a single master code that disables them, which 'only the police' will have."
"Sooner rather than later, that code will be available to everyone who wants it. Do manufacturers actually have master keys for top-end safes? I am struggling to find any useful reading on the topic of government safe raiding. "
"I can imagine manufacturers advising the FBI on structural weaknesses of the safe so they can brute force it, but a safe with a backdoor sounds like a very, very bad safe."
"If everyone stored private data in physical safes made by apple, it would be equally as bad for apple to build the safe with a backdoor, because as soon as somebody with malicious intent notices the backdoor, absolutely everybody has their safes compromised. "
"It's a lot harder to abuse seizing a safe or locked container because it requires physical access.  I think the concern is that, with the internet and digital age, a backdoor means a vulnerability that anyone could abuse from anywhere (rogue nation state, hackers, terrorists, etc).  It also has financial repercussions.  What company would trust a product that has been deliberately rendered compromised?  How will this affect Apple's iPhone sales, which would directly affect the US economy?  So, this has both security and financial repercussions, which is significant enough to have a public debate over.But if the safe maker creates a safe that even he doesn't know how to crack then the request becomes unreasonable. He can't crack it if he can't crack it.This IS the difference between physical vs digital. If the government asks for a way to unlock a strongbox or filing cabinet, that does not allow someone from ANYWHERE else in the world to reverse engineer and gain access everyone else's filing cabinets."
"The analogies aren't even the same. These devices, iPhones and other smartphones, contain vast information about a person. It's not only a matter of the government breeching privacy, it's that it leads to every digital attacker gaining an ability to track and abuse this power at will. Physical goods are not the same as the security of a digital product because one does not have to have physical proximity to access it."
"If a backdoor is created, anyone will be able to access it, track you, listen to you, and abuse this. It is something that the NSA is already abusing with gathering information about every single internet transaction wherever they can just because they can. How is this new power not going to be abused when it could then be done so easily to millions of people?> encrypted documents should legally be treated the same way as physical documents"
"Consider the difference between using physical master key and digital one. Specifically how easy it is to copy the latter. So no: they shouldn't.yeah but forcing people to crack their safes is not the same deal as forcing people to give access to all their data- especially since merely the existence of the ability to access all your data means it's guaranteed to be abused and be out there in the wild.  "
"imagine your local police officer listening in to your private voice mails/text messages just on the suspicion of you doing something illegal. that's the endgame here not privacy or whatever you're talking about.  "
"also it's very clear now that if you give the govt the ability to do something it's not a question of them following due process, it's do whatever they want ask questions when someone blows the whistleYour analogy is wrong and I will tell you why."
"Yes, no one blinks an eye when those requests for *physical* access are made. They are reasonable precisely because access will always remain physical. This matter is different in the digital world. To stay with your analogy: the FBI needs a warrant to go into your house and open your safe for the documents you hold there. One could argue that they could theoretically enter your house for that purpose without that warrant but that would clearly be unconstitutional. Moreover, you would be able to know if someone had entered your home to open your safe. What the FBI wants here is to be able to view the contents of your safe without anyone ever knowing they did so. The implication is of course that the barrier to do so *without a warrant* is immensely lowered and this opens the door to all sorts of abuse.Would you mind if I look at any and all files on your computer and on your phone? If you allow a backdoor, I'll get in there eventually.Are you the hacker known as 4chan?It's not surprising though. Thankfully it seems Apple is willing fight it. That Supreme Court nomination is looking more and more important.I suspect the PR war is even more important. Apple seems to be making good early gains in this case but overall the government is still winning: If you don't give us what we want you side with terrorists, etc.You didn't say it, but lets not forget that despite all the other reasons reddit hates Scalia he was actually on the correct side of this issue:"
"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/antonin-scalia-fighter-privacy-rights-fourth-amendmentIt seems like a paradox at first, but conservatives are normally against this sort of thing, while liberals are for it. Eh, it's not like it is that cut and dry. This does not seem like an issue that can be easily put in a spectrum of conservative -- liberal.IIRC all of the republican candidates except for Paul were pro backdoors when asked during the first debate.[Hillary Clinton](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/12/hillary-clinton-wants-manhattan-like-project-to-break-encryption/) also is in favor of breaking encryption standards.My favorite part."
"The government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone. But that's simply not true. Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices. In the physical world, it would be the equivalent of a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks -- from restaurants and banks to stores and homes. No reasonable person would find that acceptable.**Tim Cook with the reverse Taylor Swift!**"
"Nice to explicitly see They asked us to create a backdoor. Has this ever occurred in Silicon Valley(other than a canary)?"
"Hope others will stand up, this ought to bring awareness.It makes me wonder if they were ordered not to reveal it, and if not, I wonder why not? The government has been so free with orders to suppress exactly this kind of disclosure, it is hard to believe they wouldn't have applied it in this case.Terrorism cases are highly public and the locked phone has been a public issue as a result. It suddenly becoming evidence could not have been hidden.It happened with a secure email provider called  [Lavabit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavabit) but they said they'd rather shut down than give in. So they shut down!Not in silicon valley that I know of. But Linus Torvalds said he'd been approached by multiple governments.That's kinda interesting given Linux being open source.

And ultimately, we fear that this demand would undermine the very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect.   "
"This right here is the 4th Amendment. Allowing access into our private information is a direct violation. The federal government has no right and this is why Apple refused. [Scalia probably would have joined the liberal side of the court to support Apple](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/antonin-scalia-fighter-privacy-rights-fourth-amendment)Yep. I'm pretty confident that he would say the average citizen has replaced most paper transactions with their phone and that the 4th should be appliedLooks like they offed him just in time then!"
"#tinfoilApple leading the way on privacy, from [Steve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39iKLwlUqBo&t=49s) to Tim.  Incidentally, the piecemeal permission system he talks about in that video (as well as full-disk encryption) are just now being made mandatory on Android Marshmallow (5+ years later).And most devices are going to suffer big performance penalties for the new mandatory encryption. Android manufactures have been skimping out on quality NAND chips and controllers for years. "

"The average user will not be happy about this. Time and time again it has been proven that users will trade convenience for security 9 times out of 10. I can foresee a lot of Is your Android device slow? Here's one quick fix!! articles popping up in the near future. Just a heads up, modern SSDs have hardware-accelerated AES-256, and can run at full speed. "
"See all the latest Samsung SSDs. FDE performance issues came from a time when it was done with software only.not only SDDs, but modern intel CPUs have hardware accelerated AES, there's almost no difference in performance Yes, modern SSDs do have hardware accelerated encryption. But almost all Android phones do not, as they do not use SSDs in the same sense as your computer. 95% of phone's use eMMC, which is a long evolved derivative of the original SD card standard pretty much. "
"AES acceleration is included in the ARMv8 architecture, which Android phone's have just started to get in the last year or so. However, Apple includes a dedicated encryption engine that sits between the memory and storage on the phone that is faster than the ARMv8 instructions could ever wish to be. It's shit like this which is why the spec argument between iPhones and Android phones is pointless. Apple do a lot to get the most out of the hardware, more than just throwing more cores or more Mhz at it. > And most devices are going to suffer big performance penalties for the new mandatory encryption. Android manufactures have been skimping out on quality NAND chips and controllers for years."
"The situation with encryption on Android is quite bad because it just does full disk encryption in the kernel. It's slow and not very secure in the grand scheme of things. "
"Apple's phones do AES256 in hardware on the DMA path between flash storage and main memory. They can encrypt the disk as well as individual files on top of it without significant loss of performance. The iOS kernel doesn't even handle anything relevant to encryption anymore; iPhones have an isolated coprocessor running its own OS for interfacing with the encryption hardware.It's funny how apple adopted ARMv8 almost a year before the rest of the industry when they already had hardware accelerated encryption since the 3GS. The dedicated hardware still smokes the ARM implementation though. It shocks me this isn't the industry standard yet. Apple buying PA Semi back in 2008 feels super prescient right now.The loudest advocates for encryption backdoors seem to be republicans who use the argument, If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear. I suspect it was intentional that Cook essentially stated, If we defeat encryption, only terrorists and criminals will have encryption and law abiding citizens will be vulnerable. He paraphrased the If we ban guns, only criminals well have guns argument so the target audience understand it. Brilliant."
"Source: Am somewhat of a republican and support the second amendment. I also support privacy and agree this is an overreach by the government. > Source: Am somewhat of a republican and support the second amendment. I also support privacy and agree this is an overreach by the government. "
"It is impossible to be a republican and support privacy and reason. It's like being a rapist and supporting women's rights.Or supporting equality but banning jobs moving overseas."
"Wait..Well you can actually be a rapist and support womens rights. I can rape a woman and then vote pro abortion, for example.Somewhat relevant: https://xkcd.com/504/I support the second amendment in the same way I support being allowed to build a fence in my yard: I could do it, but I'm happier that I get to live in a community where I don't need to.http://i.imgur.com/vfulNIt.jpgWow. Associating  this with just Republicans....This is not limited  to them.Hillary called for a new Manhattan project on breaking encryption. Its not just Republicans.Wasn't it Snowden that said Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say?Hillary is no fan of encryption either."
"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/12/hillary-clinton-wants-manhattan-like-project-to-break-encryption/I think he also intentionally makes numerous references to the government as an entity to make it clear to any republicans who claim they believe in smaller government and who oppose taxation that there's a contradiction there if they think it's ok for a government to reach into the pockets of private citizens.> If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear"

"Please cite your source for that statement. Because that's the circle-jerkiest thing I've heard all day (granted, it's only seven thirty in the morning)."
"No one's actually saying that. What they're saying is We'll just use it this one time and they likely truly believe that, but I think it's clear to all of us that it won't stop there."
"The issue isn't that Apple is literally making a master key and handing it over-- it's that they're making a mold of a master key, and they may be asked to use it over and over again. *Eventually* that's going to turn sour-- but right now, no one's planning on ever abusing it. Of course, what they plan and what actually happens ain't ever been similar.Oh cmon, someone's opinion on one matter shouldn't implicate their entire political view of republican or democrat. "
"This is just panderingYep. I'm a conservative and have always been pro-privacy. This is not a party issue. There have been planet of liberals who support back doors.You being somewhat of a republican is not any kind of source for your statement. Come on, man.Ah yes, the republicans are definitely the loudest advocates.  That's why we need to vote a democrat into the presidency to run the executive branch and be in direct control of the FBI.  Why, once we had a democrat president such tactics by the FBI could be stopped by a single phone call to the FBI director or by telling the AG not to take Apple to court over it.  If only we had one of those....  /sIt's more of, I like the status quo, and I won't ever be fighting it. Screw everyone that might ever even try and fuck with it down the road.I like that you make this argument, because I like to see encryption and 2nd amendment linked. In my head, if the second amendment exists to safeguard the rights of citizens to defend themselves, including against their own government; and if the US government, many times in the past, has classified strong encryption as a munition and controlled its export, I believe that encryption needs to be defended on the grounds of the second amendment."
"Encryption is a defensive weapon, but it is a weapon.I invite anyone who uses the nothing to hide argument for encryption to take a dump with the door open. Pooping is natural and you're not doing anything illegal, right? So you've got nothing to hide. you are supposed ^^to ^^close ^^the ^^door?... ^^:(So simple. Thank you. Indecent exposure is illegal, so pooping in public is a shitty example. I try to leave the door open, but my girlfriend gets pissed.You need to work on your aim, bro.Does that mean I should close the door or continue the course? I'm mid push and require direction. Instructions unclear, poop stuck in ceiling fanOnly El Chupanibre can help me now. I've never noticed the hypocrisy there before but you're absolutely right. If wanting privacy means you have something to hide, then wanting a gun means you plan on shooting somebody. "
"Ironic too how second amendment activists claim the right to bear arms as important for overthrowing any future tyrannical government, when these days reliable and widely available encryption technology would be considerably more useful than guns should that need ever arise. If the data is encrypted, how would a new version of iOS be able to decrypt the data?They just need the right 4 digit code. So Apple install a new version of iOS without a limit on attempts. The FBI then try out 10000 combinations until they unlock the phone and view the contents. The idea being that custom Apple-signed iBoot software could (theoretically - there is some disagreement from Apple on this point) be written, allowing one to bypass password guess limits / automatic device erasure for failed passwords, thus allowing for the possibility of a brute force attack.> allowing one to bypass password guess limits / automatic device erasure for failed passwords"
"In the larger picture, you'd think that Apple will build the limits and deletion into hardware in the next iThings, so that an alternative firmware would not be enough to do the job.The iPhone 5s and newer use hardware for the time limiting. :)Unfortunately, the firmware on that hardware is still what decides how the time limited works, so we're not quite there yet. Source: people on Twitter who hack iOS for a living https://twitter.com/johnhedge/status/699881253189853184> In the larger picture, you'd think that Apple will build the limits and deletion into hardware in the next iThings"
"They already did, but this is an iPhone 5C with an Apple A6. The Apple A7 phones and later have an isolated coprocessor running its own OS that handles security and the timeout is implemented there. The iOS kernel has no direct access to it anymore. I just wonder how they'd install this custom version of iOS. Far as I remember you can't just plug the phone in to a computer and upgrade, you need to unlock the phone first. You'd also need to trust a new computer before the phone even communicates with it."
"You could put the device in to recovery/DFU mode but I don't think you can install iOS as a n upgrade from there, it would wipe the data they're trying to access.Remove flash chip, dump data, update data needed to run custom iOS. It would be more of a dual boot I imagine.Perhaps they have some kind of serial interface on the board that can circumvent these modes.Ah, thanks; that makes much more sense!If we continue to allow efforts of government agencies and out-of-touch politicians to weaken encryption with the justification of fighting terrorism, then the terrorists have already won. Terrorism is not merely killing for the sake of killing, but seeks to strike fear into the hearts and whittle away the freedoms of the target population. "
"Regarding the San Bernardino attack, the investigation *can* continue without targeting the privacy of every other electronics consumer - tracing connections through interviews, house warrants, and other traditional means will almost certainly provide no less evidence than engineering a weakness in software in *suspicion* of the presence of some clues. "
"Your voice *can be heard.* [Write, call, or email your representative](http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/) if you feel strongly that encryption is important to the 21st century world and must be protected. This. "
"Also, it's time to shake social media boys and girls. Get on Facebook, get on Twitter, get on fucking YouTube comments if you have to. "
"This is *Apple*, everyone knows Apple. People need to hear about this and know what our shady government is up to. "
"BernieBros? Trump supporters? This needs to become a campaign issue. Spread the word, we all need to fight this. Apple fanboys, android fanboys, freakin PCMR needs to get behind this.The government rarely gives up power once given it."
"They would immediately use this for economic spying and worse.I'm a hardcore FOSS user, but this sort of stance really does make me trust Apple. I respect them for handing over the data that they had when given a reasonable, just, legal order. I also respect them for taking a stand against an unjust, dangerous order. This is the sort of stance the major players need to be taking if a culture of protecting users privacy is to be adopted by all the other tech companies out there. Nothing but love for Apple here.I've been wanting to move to FOSS for a long time, but Apple's stance on issues like this is what keeps my trust in them and makes my probably inevitable move a less critical priority.As someone who hates Apple, wow... Tim Cook just earned so much of my respect with this.I've never understood the hate or even the need. The reality, as I've seen it play out over the last 15 years, is really just divisional marketing in a limited market."
"A great example would be Samsung. Initially copying elements of the look and feel of the leading brand and setting it up as an us versus them situation. People bought into it and they became the biggest phone vendor by volume in the world for a while. Not only doing well but they obliterated other Android resellers."
"Other companies are famous for competing in this way.> The government is asking Apple to hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customers -- including tens of millions of American citizens -- from sophisticated hackers and cybercriminals. The same engineers who built strong encryption into the iPhone to protect our users would, ironically, be ordered to weaken those protections and make our users less safe."
"Major props to Apple for standing up to this.>But now the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone."
"Very powerful words. Good on them for being so direct on this issue.*Now* Samsung needs to copy Apple.Thank you, TimThey should show Tim Cook's letter on the front page of apple.com, not some obscure customer-letter page."
"Well I guess media will pick it up pretty quickly."
"It's the fourth link under the header on the home page.They kinda did. www.apple.com, it's on one of the 4 items below the big header.Kind of happy with my choice of phone today.So fucking bad ass!Not the first time an arm of the US gov has done this. "
"Usually against smaller companies, but if you look, you'll be surprised how many big US multinational companies have had the same strong armed request and threat and complied out of fear (financially, criminally and politically). "
"Not many took this stance and survive unscathed, so I tip my hat to him. Goodluck."
"Most end up with their business ruined, bankrupt and sometimes even criminal charges and somehow end up dead or in hiding shortly afterwards."
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LavabitTim Cook has so much of my respect for standing as a crusader for encryption and privacy. "
"Even though I'm not an Apple guy, they're currently the only company actively pushing this issue and not just with words but they're actually building products and software which supports this. Out of curiosity, why couldn't the FBI just build the backdoor themselves?  I'm specifically asking about this phone in question.  How would they get this backdoor onto an already locked phone that even apple isn't suppose to be able to access currently?The FBI can't create iOS from scratch in order to build a back door into it. "
"The fbi is, from my understanding, is essentially asking the new version of iOS to be built by Apple to include code to remove the limit of times a pin code can be attempted prior to it erasing and resetting as per current iOS protocol. Removing this feature would allow the fbi to simply brute force 4 digit pins until it's unlocked. They would also need the use of Apple's security certificates to sign the update and their server infrastructure to pass the update to the phone IF they somehow built their own firmware.While I'm no fan of Apple and it's past actions, I applaud Tim for this statement. Apple just gained some massive cred today. For once I'm glad that I'm using their phones.People ask me why I trust certain corporations like Apple with my data over the government. It's pretty simple, Apple has a financial interest in protecting my data, the government does not. This is a fantastic step forward against the moves the US Gov is taking to bypass encryption."
"The standard consumer does not read tech blogs. They don't read forums such as these and journals on the pros and cons of strong encryption on personal devices. They buy gadgets, and use them."
"When someone like Tim Cook is so open about the intentions of Apple in this case, people will listen. He has the opportunity to speak directly to the consumers and be heard by a much wider audience, unlike the tech blogs which have been saying the same thing."
"It's by getting these consumers to be pro-encryption that we can ensure it's here to stay. Tech geeks like us can care all we want but if the standard consumer doesn't understand why it's so important then it's easy to spread misinformation or for people to simply not care when it's gone.I am a pretty staunch Google supporter and have stayed away from Apple products for a while. If Apple wins this fight I will buy an i something just to show my support. Your turn Google/Alphabet. Time to step the fuck upHoly SHIT. This is an amazing show of integrity from Apple and Tim Cook.This is the best course of action to bring the issue of what the gov't is doing to the surface. The average American probably wouldn't batter an eyelid if their response wasn't this big.Data Security is definitely something Apple take pride in."
"I sit here waiting for the next jailbreak to fiddle around inside, but on the other side of the fence it's their, mine and all consumer's worst nightmares for reasons/posts like this. The exploit being used for something other than just an enhancement platform.I guess the US government will have to decide which they love more: invading the privacy of their citizens or sucking corporate dick.Apple just went up a few points in my book. Taking this threat and telling the people about it up front. Does the government not understand that compromising security on the iPhone would destroy apple? If (when) this masterkey version of iOS got into the wrong hands, the iPhone would no longer be secure for anyone. People would be tossing iPhones in the trash. It would be ruinous for apple. "
"I understand that what the FBI is asking for isn't a simple backdoor access code, but the average user won't take the time to understand the difference. Oh the iPhone isn't secure? Better toss it."
"I'm happy to see Cook taking this stance on privacy. I hope enough people care about this to get some definitive protections against the government prying into our devices.I wholeheartedly agree. I am very happy to see Cook taking this stance on privacy, which has become a vital, if overlooked, necessity in this day and age. I never have much to say about apple, but I have to applaud their integrity with this decision, regardless of how much these decisions are self beneficial. As much as i dislike apple i deeply respect what they're doing hereNot a fan of Apple or its products, but my respect for them shot way up. This was a huge. Props to them for standing up when it mattered the most. My position on them definitely changed in the positive light The people that support backdoor access do not fully understand why encryption is needed and what serious repercussions can happen.  Don't let the government scare us out of our freedom like the Patriot Act.  Educate yourself on what encryption is all about and why it's a necessity and you'll understand why creating a backdoor is such a bad idea.Cook deserves much respect for this response.I have to admit I gained a bunch of respect for Apple just now."
"Earlier today I thought They just want to remove the security system that prevents brute force attempts. Not actually remove the encryption so its okay. This slapped me back to my senses and helped me to realize this is NOT okay."
"Apple allowing this would be saying it is okay to weaken security because something is bad enough That is the kind of crap that got the Patriot Act passed and the police thinking that excessive force is okay. "
"This IS a real slippery slope. Not some fake They coming for our guns! slippery slope the gun nuts are always saying whenever someone wants to pass a gun control measure."
"So I applaud apple and hope they take this to the highest court. The FBI should do its job and do a complete investigation (The one they didn't do when they left a frakking crime scene open to the media!) not work on eroding civil liberties hoping for a quick fix.TIL that Apple encrypts your iPhone to the point they put the data out of our own reachAs an Android user, I must say...BRAVO. "
"Makes me wonder if Samsung already has a backdoor in my Note 4....I don't like their products, but I applaud them for their stance on this matterDevil's advocate here. How could we ever know if a backdoor was created? Couldn't Apple publicly refuse but secretly allow access to the government? Our nation's history is full of lies and scandals, why couldn't this just be another?More than likely it would be found. That information would then be used to blackmail the company or sold to competition to use as proof and ruin Apple or others."
"The backdoors can be found, especially since there are a lot of people out there actively tracking things like this down. I love watching Defcon videos and gotta figure a lot of things like this would come out there for certain.Yeah I've pretty much read the same thing from a lot of people. Backdoors are very hard to hide especially in something as popular as an iPhone.The feds should have directly contacted the Chinese for assistance in this matter.Can you smell what the TIM is cookingI hope other companies use this to make a stand as well.>All that information needs to be protected from hackers and criminals who want to access it, steal it, and use it without our knowledge or permission. "
"I think I'd actually be more worried about government and law enforcement than I would be hackers and criminals. The latter might have the ability to steal your money or identity but the former can flat out destroy your life!*Gets the popcorn ready*Apple giving the finger to the over intrusive government and exposing their legal tactic in doing so... Using an Act from 1798?? Seriously?? "
"If they had a legitimacy to what they are doing, they would pass a modern day law. I own zero Apple products and I am about to run to the store.....Fucking glad that I only use iPhones and buy the same for my family members as well.Tomorrow's submission: Tim Cook held in contempt of ~~FBI~~ court and arrested by US Marshalls.Can someone ELI5 what the call to action is?  I don't understand the purpose of the letter...Federal government wants into the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters. Apple says that literally can't be done. FBI wants Apple to build that back door from scratch. Apple says fuck that, knowing that it sets a precedent and the code to do this couldn't possibly be kept safe or even reserved only for terrorism investigations.All the people saying they respect apple now, or they hate them but agree on this... This sort of thing is par for the course in my view. This is the apple I've always known and this is no surprise at all. "
"The way they pushed recycling, reducing harmful materials, and other noble causes when there was no financial incentive to do so. They do things because they're the right thing to do. [Mad props.](http://i.imgur.com/VfaGh9P.gif?noredirect) Not an Apple fan but I definitely admire Tim Cook for that.What is the FBI claiming they may need from the phone that they don't have?   Sounds like they are trying to use this as an excuse to force Apple to give them a tool they have wanted for yearsThings that affected this; Guns and Religion"
"Things that didn't affect this; Encryption and Tim CookOh shit, I hope Bill Gates gets behind this. That'd be huge.i dislike apple as a company but this is the correct response. Praise should be given for this decision.i think my respect for apple just went up a notch(android user)"
"This man has just earned my absolute respect. If this is indeed the way he's proceeding, and this isn't a ruse to keep the public at bay while some back room deals are being worked out, he's a model for other companies to follow.Today I hate Apple a little less.Imagine you live in a home built by a large home builder. Toll Brothers, Ryan Homes, Ryland Homes, etc..... Imagine the FBI were trying to get a criminal in one of these homes. So they turn to the home builder and say Give us a key that opens the backdoor to every home you've ever built. But we only want to use it this once, even though we will keep the key afterwards. Would you find that acceptable? I would not.Oh wow, Props to Apple for doing that. Respect! Maybe my next phone will be an iphone. If iPhone isn't your thing, turn on full Disk encryption. Just note though. Apple, as with every other company, has to hand over information to the FBI if they request it. They have no choice. The issue here is that the FBI wants an easy way to decrypt it. So while companies like Google may have a bad rep for cooperating, its not like they had a choice, and they too are firm on the no backdoors policy. It's just that Apple is more outspoken about it because they are the first to implement full disk encryption as standards in their phones and do it retroactively via updates. So they encounter these requests more so. I'm no fan of Apple in general, but support their stance on this issue.Good for Apple, MS are also fighting the good fight too, the US want access to MS accounts outside the US and issue court orders to do just that!!The FBI is attempting to use a 227 year old law (1789) to justify forcing a private company to create a software backdoor in 2016...exposing the private information of millions of US citizens and even individuals abroad. This would include access to our health data, location tracking, text messages, etc. Kudos to Apple for standing up against tyranny; let's hope they prevail and prevent a precedent from being established which would effectively demolish the final barrier of privacy we have left.Title is a tad misleading, FBI wants a backdoor in all iPhones, not just getting into this one person's phone. Good for Cook and Apple for saying noI read that they only want in this phone. They want a way to brute force the password. They want Apple to change the software in THIS phone so they can do that. I'm OK with them wanting in this phone as it's proven they are terrorists. Anymore info gained from this phone could be valuable. However I think Apple should be the ones to get the data and then send that to the FBI and not just allow the FBI to do the 'cracking'. Once they find a way in, fuck knows what they'll get upto. At least you can trust Apple to not do this on all other phones, once they have the data the FBI want.Tim Cook, you really earned my respect!"
"https://giphy.com/gifs/little-jeter-yCAoGdVUCW5LWPLAYER 2 HAS ENTERED THE GAME>Customers expect Apple and other technology companies to do everything in our power to protect their personal information, and at Apple we are deeply committed to safeguarding their data."
"https://m.popkey.co/1c786e/kvKXd.gifThis is nice. But nowhere does it say we won't or we refuse. It simply says they're asking us to, this tool does not exist yet, and we think it's a dangerous thing. This almost reads as a canary. As in, this is what we're being asked to do... now you know."
"The article says they've complied with every FBI request (and then some). And remember under things like the Patriot Act, these companies aren't ALLOWED to tell you they've given the government access to your data. We'll see how things go, but this seems like nice PR, allowing them to seem well-intended (and maybe they are) while ultimately going along with it (and maybe they feel they have no choice)."
"It's really important that users control their data. Decentralization, encryption, etc. If you are funnelling your data to one company (Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Dropbox, whoever), signing huge EULAs you don't understand/read, using code that can't be understood, that you don't control... then we can't be surprised when these things happen. People want everything to be easy and don't care as long as it works. But the power we're giving to these companies, and governments around the world, is very very dangerous.People don't care. Look at how many people use Chrome, for example.It's a sad day when I completely agree with Apple on something...  Fuck you, government. If a lone analyst could sit inside the army and take off with all top-secret data, imagine the story repeating itself over at FB(Ayyeee) with all your personal data.Could this create a similar scenario to Lavabit? If this goes all the way to the end, is one of the options for apple to shut down in order to maintain its stance?Something related to the subject of device encryption. [This](https://theintercept.com/2015/11/15/exploiting-emotions-about-paris-to-blame-snowden-distract-from-actual-culprits-who-empowered-isis/) may provide further insight into what the government is trying to do."
"Damn. Props to apple for thisMajor Respect to him for standing up to his beliefs o7Why do they need to oppose this?  I was under the impression that they couldn't do it in the first place.  They can still update the phone to a new insecure OS, and then hack that new OS."
"With the current OS/software/hardware/etc they can't.Could someone explain how this is any different from trying to gain access to an encrypted hard drive?"
"Why can't you take the memory out of the phone, clone the encrypted data, then do as many brute force attacks as you want?"
"Any info appreciated!The encryption on a hard drive can be easily brute forced since it is not protected by an outer layer of security. It can be copied bit by bit or attached to a third party computer which then can try to decrypt the file system for as long as it wants. The iPhone on the other hand protects its file system; it is only accessible via the touch interface and strongly limits the amount of tries you have to enter a password. It also provides the option to erase the system if the password is entered incorrect ten times."
"Imagine your HardDrive in a save that you have to open by punching in a code and if you enter the wrong number ten times it will nuke the hard drive inside..."
"Why they don't just repsond we don't have the means to unencrypt this phone? done.Because they've not been asked to directly decrypt it, and AFAIK it's established fact that they *do* have the ability to do what they have been ordered to do.That is what they normally reply with when ordered to decrypt the device.  This time the court ordered a custom firmware be created so that the FBI could attempt to guess the phones passphrase as many times and as quickly as they wanted so they could gain access.  Also the new firmware would remove the auto wipe after 'x' attempts protection.Wow. Um yeah what he said. The next thing he should do is publicly call out other tech giants to take the same stance.Tim Cook is referring to 2 different things and I'm unclear of what is actually going on here :"
"* a master key which would be installed on a new iOS version which would presumably be usable as soon as the user decrypts content (a master key is by itself unusable if it wasn't used to encrypt the key to the data and if the current protection is well designed it can't happen until users decrypt their data)."
"* a way to input passwords at a faster pace than through the interface."
"Like he explains the first is a technical and social aberration, but the second is a different beast and he doesn't explain why it's such a bad thing. I'm even surprised the FBI needs Apple to circumvent the GUI and input passwords directly. If they can't it's more security through obscurity than real security : if you get at the flash content (which should be possible, I don't think iPhone are destroying themselves if they are opened) and know the data layout you should be able to copy the data elsewhere and brute-force the password. There could be a TPM device in there protecting the password though : is the US government requiring the TPM device to be backdoored too?Bad things await us frensAs long as Apple publicly supports this type of consumer security, they've got me as a customer. God damn it US Gov, see what you did, you made Tim Cook sad.Not a big Apple guy, but good for them. Encryption shouldn't be lessened. GG Tim Cook. Holy shit, i thought this was all talk from some some sincerely stupid mother fuckers. The judge that ordered this needs to be disbarred immediately. "
"Everyone should encrypt their phones right now.Well I hope if apple does cave the will tell the world so people can avoid that IOS update. Its small shred of hope, but it would be nice. I'm very impressed Mr. Cook. You came off extremely heartfelt and trustworthy. I'm wondering, if this attack was just a part of a larger plan and going through imessage could have revealed/prevented this what would happen?Don't like Apple but I like this stance they're taking. >While we believe the FBI's intentions are good, it would be wrong for the government to force us to build a backdoor into our products. "
"So they might not have a choice to do it.. people say usa has democracy. FBI and USA government have been doing such things for a long time. apple will eventual give up. there is no please. do it or you are fucked.The government already has access to our health records and financial data.  The government can even track cash spending on a limited basis (newer bills are chipped).  "
"Anything uploaded to iCloud will be turned over with a subpoena and can be hacked without a subpoena (Did you people forget about The Fappening already?)."
"If you do anything on the Internet, the NSA has it in their databases."
"The letter sounds great but the only thing protected by your phone's encryption are photos not uploaded to the Internet and data stored in apps with no Internet connectivity."
"If you believe owning an iPhone/iPad or an encrypted Android secures your data from anyone but petty thieves, don't kid yourself.It's in Apple's interest to refuse to provide a backdoor. Otherwise, their products will stop selling in 250 other countries over the world. Even American citizens would probably switch away from iOS on the day such a backdoor is created. Ultimately, Apple would probbably have to close its Phone business.The government is like the creepy guy who tells the girl it's just the tip.Dear FBI,"
"Fuck off. "
"Love Always,"
"Tim.Serious question. What can the government do if Apple engineers just shrugs and say we don't know how to do it?I wonder if the FBI would allow US president or other high level politician to own an iPhone with a known backdoor.Secret Service only let Obama have a limited Blackberry after a whole lot of back and forth. I remember there was an episode of that Bear Grylls show where Obama was with him, Bear suggested they take a selfie by a waterfall and Obama said he had to borrow a phone from a member of his staff because he was not allowed to have oneThe cynic in me worries that this is just a PR move while they do indeed comply with the demands of the FBI in some way or another, but I'm gonna try to push that aside for now and say, good job Tim Cook. If this is honest and sincere then I'm very impressed despite not being much of an Apple guy myself.I think he should have ended it with saying We dont negotiate with terrorists"
"That would have gotten the message across.I've never been a fan of Apple. Somewhere between the image of the average Apple user and the company's marketing and/or business decisions, I've found countless arguments opposing the use of their products."
"But, this. I don't simply like this. I *respect* this. I may not get rid of my smartphone tomorrow but I am paying attention. And if the world we are heading towards involves governments being so shamelessly indifferent to a citizen's privacy, Apple may just have won a customer by taking such a clear stance on this.Really gonna need a 9 the justice who supports strong encryptionMore back bone than other tech companies."
"In a world where the vast majority of American's aren't educated in the relatively complex mathematics of data security, how can we expect people to even understand the implications of the FBI's request. I guess my biggest concern here is the implication that this *is* possible, even if Apple are refusing to do it."
"The technical specialists at the FBI know what the roadblocks are and what's needed to bypass them. Getting Apple to write the software is the easy route. The hard route (writing it themselves) is still available and they will probably take it."
"What this also exposes - not just for Apple, but probably all mobile OSes - is an inherent security flaw where the security of your data is directly reliant on the security roadblocks placed in the software. That is, that the security of the data can be massively weakened simply by replacing the OS."
"It would seem fundamental now that the two must be interlinked and go as far as encrypting the entire OS along with the data such that you either decrypt everything or you brick the device. Simply, it shouldn't be possible to replace the OS without having authority to access to the data."
"How many smart phones use hardware security modules in addition to data encryption?"
"Edit: To use the door/key analogy, while they don't have a master key, they have implicilty confirmed that it is theoretically possible to replace the entire locking mechanism with one that's way easier to pick, without opening or damaging the door."
"That's a fundamental design flaw.As much as I hate their walled-garden app ecosystem preventing me from developing without Apple hardware or paying through the nose for a rental server just for compilation, it *does* give them a hell of a lot of control to protect average users. Good on you Tim!!! I hate Apple, but damn, I really love Tim Cook.Very well stated. I may not support Apple in much, but Tim Cook is amazing for standing up for Apple users. Apple may be the only company that can lead in such an endevor. Nothing against Microsoft, but I personally doubt a similar message from Satya could have as much sway behind it.I hope they get what they wantWhich party? If Apple, me too. Maybe it's just due to politics but the whole article sounds like it would actually be possible to do it and decrypt an existing so called secure iPhone. If the iPhone really is secure, no discussion would be needed as nothing could be done to encrypt it."
"But how is the iPhone actually secured? A 4 digit pin isn't exactly hard to break. Just need a summer student trying out all combinations in a smart way."
"http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2012-09/infographic-day-fastest-way-crack-4-digit-pin-numberHe could have just shortened it to fuck da policeHe should make some more donations to congressmen. They have the IRS covered already, a couple of extra mil should take care of the Feds....He better have his mechanic check his brake lines. I have an iphone and really like it. That being said, is it really that hard to believe that there isn't already a backdoor in ios and this is just for publicity?If they have the possibility to unlock an encrypted device even if they have to create a tool that does not exist yet, doesn't that mean there is already a backdoor?Just yesterday two City Watch officers beat up a citizen, drove him to a forest and threatened with death after he pointed out that they were breaking the law. Now they are in jail mostly thanks to the fact that he recorded the incident on his iPhone. They tried accessing the phone to delete the video but failed. "
"Edit: Happened in Warsaw, Poland. They are innocent until proven otherwise, but that video is a pretty solid proof. And City Watch is not a police in case anyone wonders. It's a glorified security without guns. "
"Could Apple use The First Amendment as a defense against the court order compelling it to backdoor iOS?"
"https://plus.google.com/+CodyCasterline/posts/Cx21oSbbo4wWhat prevents people from brute-forcing the memory directly instead of using some intentionally limited UI? Does not sound that hard with only 10k key permutations...I wish there a presidential candidate that held such views... Oh, wait...Time to post a scene from one of my favorite movies, a Man for All Seasons: https://youtu.be/PDBiLT3LASk"
"Can someone explain this to me? The FBI requests a new version of iOS to be installed on a single phone that was involved in the attack.  What, exactly, does this mean?  If the phone is locked, how will they install new software on it without unlocking?  People are suggesting an update to iOS that will get pushed-out to all users, but contain a backdoor that is specific to that one particular device -- but how will the new iOS version be installed without unlocking first?I believe you can force an update to a device. I don't know the specifics. The Update wouldn't be available to everybody. Only to FBI for them to use when they need to decrypt someone's device. Automatic software update just for that phone, maybe? Apple would surely have the tools to force the phone to update with or without its passcode The update would allow it to be unlocked. But just in forcing Apple to make that happen, the update may as well be put on everyone's phones for all Apple's customers are concerned. It would mean our data is no longer safe. can someone explain to me what how exactly is the terrorist's phone encrypted? I'm here thinking because they can't get past the lock screen and icloud activation. Is that all? I bet this has already been made."
"This could be a cover up. Makes me wonder about Samsungs or any other phone company's stance on this. Does google embrace this as well with their products? I'd like to hear from them now.My next phone is an IPhone.I wonder if the backdoor can be also applied to android, or already has.I really dislike apple and their walled garden approach and policies. However this, this is right on the ball.Why doesn't Apple create a tool to get into the phone but not give it to law enforcement? You want to get into the phone, get a court order, bring us the phone, we'll do it for you. Problem solved? It's a burden on Apple, time, employees, etc.. so charge law enforcement $1,000 per device. Does anyone really think there should be no way to access the information on two mass murderer's phones? Both extremes are unnacceptable ie No one can access a locked phone or law enforcement has carte blanche to break into people's locked phones. Seems pretty simple to find an acceptable middle ground.>Why doesn't Apple create a tool to get into the phone but not give it to law enforcement?"
"The problem here is, where is this tool going to be stored? Is it just one computer/server inside a special room inside Apple HQ? Like it was said in the article, the fear is not so much the Government (though we know it is), but also the other people who may potentially get their hands on this.What if the tool leaks?What about people autside of USA ? Can they not just Patriot Act into it?damn, much respect to tim cook "
"I'm confused. Are the FBI trying to install a 'back door' which allows them to simply open the phone, or are they trying to get access to a program which would allow them to input a passcode infinetly without consequences?Never been an Apple fan but fair play to them for the stance they're taking. Wish more companies would do the sameHate the products. Despise iOS. iTunes is the worst piece of shit to ever contaminate a PC."
"Love the stance on encryption, howeverEveryone is so worried about what uncle sam can get off your iphone. chances are they already have it. I-phone might be encrypted, but once data leaves the phone, that data is open to anyone wanting to grab it. "
"The San Bernardino killers can't use their phone anymore, so that data is just sitting. Won't xmit. 10 failed login attempts and the phone resets, losing all data that could potentially help in the case or prevent more attacks. "
"Let's say some sicko kidnaps a shit ton of kiddies, stashes them all over, and stores that info on his i-phone. Gets into it with our boys in blue, and gets shot 20 times.....killer is down. What about those kids? You guys gonna scream 4th amendment then?"
"slippery slope argument can go a lot of different ways.As a practitioner of law, I got to say, attempting to use the All Writs Act of 1789 is a bold move Cotton.  I get uncomfortable when I have to rely on case law from the 1980's.I'm usually not a fan of apple but this is objectively a good thing for them to do.Hah, a US corporation is defending people's right to privacy. Meanwhile in the UK the government introduces surveillance laws and the public doesn't even blink an eye. Preach on, brother Tim.  Apple is not in the business of peddling personal data, nor should it be.Good on Tim Cook ... I am not a fan of Apple by any measure, but kudos to the company standing up for its customers/constituents - pity politicians don't have the balls to do the same thing!"
"(except for Bernie Sanders of course)Reddit in a nutshell right here.Congrats to apple for not giving in to the FBI; However, with all of the security flaws, in damn near every release of iOS, all the FBI has to do is wait around for some script kiddie to notice it, and brag about finding it, online. That'll give them a little more of a chance to gaining access to the device without apples help, and didn't do anything illegal because Apple released the iOS version that gave such access."
"I mean, when apple decides to release a patch, the FBI doesn't need to update the iOS until someone else brags about another security flaw they've found, and so on, and so forth. "
"Trying to get a shell program to access the data is just ridiculous though. Millions of Apple iOS users, not even just iPhones. Those without iPhones probably have an iTouch, or an iPad. "
"That expands their access to damn near everyone in the US and insane amounts overseas. All they would need to do is obtain your device for a short period of time and load Thor version of iOS and BAM, your info and everything you say/do is right in front of them. "
"Who knows, maybe they can even just do a fake Apple server and when people update, it's actually a phishing site to the FBI's version. Apple would be none the wiser and just think people wanted to jailbreak, or haven't updated yet. By then... It's too late. All your data is compromised, and so is Apples integrity. "
"Good on Apple for not being the governments bitch outside what is legally required. "
"Edit: their* version of iOS, not Thor. Although that sounds like a nice update name. I wonder if Steve left this on his will and why they're so adamant. Good job Apple. Steve hired Tim, presumably because he trusted him. No need to put anything in writing. Apple really pulled through for their end users this time. not yet. "
"This is just the start of pulling.>We oppose this order, which has implications far beyond the legal case at hand. "
"Sorry for being dumb. Does that mean that they did not give up yet, or they already gave it to FBI very and publicly reluctantly. Simply means they won't do itThey are refusing a court order. So the government can now decided to come in and force them at gun point arrest them all shut down apple attempt to sue them"
"But they won't because that would really step up the whole police state thing.Bravo Tim Cook! Bravo!I fully support Apple in this. If they compromise I wouldn't buy another iPhone. Law enforcement will have to do their job instead of relying on technology.You do realize that Apple are one of the strongest supporters of this, if Apple are forced to back down, then there aren't any other phone companies which would be safe.Pretty sure that was clear in the letter that they support it Wow, imposing The Writ Act which was written in 1789!? On 2016 tech? That's reaching a bit, to put it mildly. The FBI should ask China to help. I'm sure they already have a suitable backdoor enabled iOS version already they could lend out.When the government feels it is beyond the protocol of checks and balances..If the Apple team can create a new IOS that can unlock the data on an existing iPhone without destroying it, I wonder if a hacker team couldn't do the same.The FB fucking I can't get into the phone themselves??? And they expect me to believe this?  All they want is a back door device that they can use over and over. 10 failed attempts and the phone resets. They need to preserve the data within, not just break in.# The 4th Amendmemt"
"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things ..."
"Thank you Tim Cook for respecting the 4th Amendmemt.The problem here is that also becomes a Well....we tried letter when they are strong armed to do it anyway. I applaud Mr. Cook in this efforts, but does anyone seriously think  this ends well, without government overreach? I have a distaste for Apple products for reasons I won't discuss here but this response is exactly why I appreciate their existence. An open letter to the customer on such a controversial topic regardless of stance is a courageous and commendable move.As a loyal Android user and Apple hater I have to say I have nothing but respect for Mr. Cook.  While I'll never support Apple as a company I will support them on issues like this.  I hope Apple and Google can put their differences aside and work together to fight this, let's face it if any company gives in that sets a precedent and the rest will fall like domino's."
"Bravo Mr. Cook.Dear United States Government: Fuck off.And this is how it begins ..."
"They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety. - Benjamin Franklinlol this begun like 15 years ago bud.....good quote thoThis is insanity."
"As soon as Apple products have a legally mandated backdoor, everyone will stop buying them. "
"We're talking the death of the company here."
"Imagine a world where only American products had legally mandated backdoors.... "
"The lack of understanding it shows from the FBI is telling, too.... the people in charge are simply too old to be working there any more, they just do not get how information flows in the modern world."
"The 1960's world of shut the presses, arrest the journalists, squash all leaks is dead and gone. You CANNOT stop the spread of information in our world. Which means as soon as one hacker, criminal or terrorist has access to that backdoor, they all will within weeks...there is NO WAY to stop this. Ask Edward Snowden. Or DVD John."
"What needs to be done is, the heads of the FBI (Or whoever suggested this nonsense) need to be retired. They are dangerously old and outdated - what other stupid decisions are they making that actually endanger America rather than keep it secure?"
"I think this would be death for American IT products...goodbye to your server sales, phone sales, router sales....I honestly don't get the support for apple on this one......It's not about the shooters. It's about privacy generally. Once you build a back door into your house, anybody can walk in. Once you build a back door to your iPhone, anybody can hack it. Am I naive to say that if it means me being safe from the bad guys, I really don't give a care what the govt wants to do with my meaningless text messages.  Are you that scared that you're willing to part with every last shred of your privacy? I'm pretty sure that's how the FBI wants you to feel.I hate Apple, like down to my core, deep seated hatred. I have my reasons. But I must commend them on their stance on encryption and government overreach."
"I fear that the government would try to force this issue by using terrorism, much on the same way the Patriot Act was implemented, but they would never stop with just the San Bernardino case. No, if history and working for the government has taught me one thing it's that once the government has a resource then they will use that resource for their own twisted purposes."
"The NSA and other 3 letter groups keep talking about backdoors and that if we, the American people, are doing nothing wrong then it shouldn't be a problem. No, the problem is that the American people don't want the government having unfettered access to their personal lives - personal conversations - or other things. The problem is that these 3 letter organizations are making enemies out of each and every single American citizen."
"When did we become enemies of the state that they should need unlimited access to our personal data at any given time?Fuck the government. Eh, Apple are protecting their sales. They could help unlock the phone, they just don't want to.Although I don't like the idea of multinationals saying no to the government in a case that is obviously in everyone's best interest to solve, I am also against Big Brother creating secret privacy exceptions for itself alone. "
"I'm torn on this one."
"I hope the courts can sort it out.Its not that simple."
"The Police allowed the media access to the murder scene obliterating any forensic evidence there."
"This isn't about solving a case, this is about using this heavily reported emotionally fuelled situation to set a legal president, the defeat of encryption.Hang on a second. The fact that what the FBI is asking for is even possible in principle --- for Apple to write *software* that can be *installed* on the phone to facilitate its decryption --- means that the security of iPhone encryption is not actually resting on strong cryptography, or on the tamper-resistance of the secure coprocessor, a.k.a. [secure enclave](http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/10/why-cant-apple-decrypt-your-iphone.html). Instead, it's just security through obscurity. If Apple can write this software, then in principle someone else can write it by reverse engineering the stock firmware.From the letter they wrote Specifically, the FBI wants us to make a new version of the iPhone operating system, circumventing several important security features, and install it on an iPhone recovered during the investigation. In the wrong hands, this software -- which does not exist today -- would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone's physical possession.Apple is being asked to create a version of iOS that won't enforce passcode attempt limits and, ideally, will allow for electronic (rather than on-screen) passcode entry."
"Essentially government wants Apple to remove to OS-level protection against brute-force attacks.This is the iphone 5c that does not have hardware based security with the secure enclave. Thanks, you're right. Here's a source with the details: http://blog.trailofbits.com/2016/02/17/apple-can-comply-with-the-fbi-court-order/I don't understand why the fbi doesn't disassemble the phone to get to the memory it self and do a memory dump. Then they can brute force it all they want, and much faster than over the iPhone user interface The answer is one word: encryption. EVERYTHING in the iPhone is encrypted. Because the data is encrypted. So they could do that but you just end up with a senseless mess.I bet the government (NSA) already knows how to hack these phones but they are playing it off like they can't. To convince the world that smartphones are private and can't be hacked. So when Apple sells user information to government agencies for money without the knowledge of the user, it's very much ok, but when they are ordered by court to help solve a monstrous deadly case, it's not ok, and users must be protected. What a crock of s**t.Great statement. Now bring back manufacturing to the US and I'll buy an iPhone forever.Are you willing to pay $5000 for one though? hahaha at this rate, i hope Apple moves headquarters to somewhere else entirely. "
"If it makes you feel better most of the design and software engineering is done in the USTheir most high end, specialised and most powerful desktop is made in the US."
"Do you want expensive iPhones? Because that's how you get expensive iPhones.They already are expensive."
"Do you want American jobs? Because that's how you get American jobs.And they will be substantially more expensive if manufacturing is brought back to the US...The American Jobs guy was a massive asshole to his employees.It's not even just cost. The sheer _capacity_ does not exist. Apple already manufactures short-run products in the US, like the Mac Pro. You don't have the skills in the US unfortunately. "
"Edit. "
"http://m.theregister.co.uk/2015/12/21/apple_60_minutes_interview/I just read through all 50 responses.  100% of which support Apple plus a few questions mixed into it.   I don't see a single person supporting the investigators to find out what else is on the terrorists phone.  Maybe who funded it.  Maybe some leaders who are leading another terrorist cell.  The goal would be to prevent more deaths."
"I don't get why Reddit users are so passionate about back doors, encryption, and privacy.  "
"I've seen people worried about a big brother looking at all your stuff and a slippery slope that they could just look for any reason at all but unless you are a terrorist, why would they even care and what would they even do when they looked at your phone?   "
"To me, it seems like Reddit users, using the same logic, would also ban every form of wire tapping under all circumstances.   "
"I just don't get it as tens of thousands of murders, pedophiles, terrorists and such have been caught using these methods.  I don't see why this is so bad where privacy concerns are more important.   "
"Can someone give an example of why I should want terrorists to have encryption so that I can have my encryption?"
"Terrorists will still have encryption and you won't, you haven't thought about this much have you.I'm no security expert but if all terrorists will have encryption then why couldn't normal civilians who are so passionate about their own data just apply the same encryption? "
"Because once you put a back door in, anybody can use it for anything. Because if Apple is forced to make that back door, next time, what if it's not about terrorists? Or what if someone with nefarious purposes exploits the newly-added security flaw? Think of how much deeply personal information is on your phone. Don't say you have nothing to hide. You have plenty that the government and other individuals have no right to know."
"The government has no right to force Apple's hand by making them craft a security flaw that does not currently exist. Encryption is easy to do but hard to crack. Forcing companies to weaken and disable their encryption will make you open to hacking. Privacy is more than just your texts and photos. How often do you do your banking online? How often do you do your taxes? Submit resumes with private information? No encryption makes it SUPER easy for a hacker to just swoop in and pretend to be you, steal your identity and your money."
"Do you have a job? You probably have knowledge that would be useful to your employer's competitors. Hope you don't have anything that could be used to extort you. Businesses outside of the US won't want to work with us. Like, they simply won't trust anything made by the US and for good reason."
"Worst of all, the bad people will always have encryption. Always. It's just math."
">tens of thousands of murders, pedophiles, terrorists and such have been caught using these methods."
"Have a source on that?I'll bet most are members of facebook, and all the rest of social media."
"People themselves are their own worst enemies when it comes to privacy and security."
"Guys, help me out here. I'm struggling to find a way to hate on Apple for this.He's just trying to make himself look good for when they're finally forced to comply. It's smoke being blown directly up your asshole.What stops the government to write this code them selves without Apple knowing anything about it?Technically nothing. But it would be a very tedious process to rewrite big chunks of iOS from scratch. Not absolutely impossible (I guess you could hire some ex-programmers from Apple) but very expensive and time consuming to craft."
"I am also pretty sure it wouldn't be easy to do without some Apple internal keys - I somehow doubt you can flash iPhone with any firmware/software you want and it will work fine, it probably uses some checksums/keys. "
"Much easier (and actually legal whereas stealing Apple's keys and forcing former employees that have signed NDA to help you write a backdoor probably doesn't count as such) to ask the developer to do it for you. I don't normally say this, but *Daaaaamn!*, **respect!**Privacy aside, it would also be a massive blow to Apples sales if this was made public as people would desert in droves. Where would they go? Google and Microsoft are also American companies, vulnerable to the same issue. Excellent point - if one caves, then it's likely the others will follow, although being truly multi-national I'd suggest they would simply move offshore.I don't think most people realize just how damn important this is. This is nothing more than government mandated security vulnerabilities, and it should be called that explicitly to remind people just what the FBI is asking."
"This is a rare case of a company putting their butt on the chopping block to stand up for consumers, it's important that they're supported.Wow. Once this blows over, I'll go back to hating apple. For now, rock on! Dear US Government. Go. Fuck. Yourself. Signed, Suspicious Person 389.You are guaranteed protection from illegal search and seizure.  Once warrants are granted and there is an investigation, you have no more protection.  Never in our history has there been anything that was protected from search when court ordered.  I am an advocate of privacy, but that all happens before the fact.  Once you are being officially investigated, the authorities have every right to search your things.  What you are all arguing is not preserving privacy, it is creating a new class of never searchable no matter what documents.  This has never existed.Which one? The two found dead? What about the three, tall and athletic shooters reported initially?The fbi wanted a back door on a potential suspects phone? Like, a bug? Is that it? Why wouldn't he do this? Confused. I guess I'm one of the only people seeing this as a business strategy. I think it was a damn smart move by Tim. Make that shit public and let everyone know.Proud iPhone users here. Always have been and always will be."
"Thanks Tim for standing up for what's right So let me get this straight, it's okay for society to give cops guns and allow them to shoot people so long as the cops actions fall with-in the rules, but we draw the line when it comes to giving the cops Muhammed's iphone contact list.  Nice soapbox reddit, but this makes no sense.  Decrypt that phone if you have a warrant.This isn't just any old search and seizure warrant. The FBI wants Apple to make its customers' data less secure generally. It's a terrorism investigation now, but what's it going to be tomorrow?Go Timmy, dude's got balls, gay balls, but balls nonetheless.>FBIs intentions are good."
"I didn't realize he was writing a comedy piece.Is this the exact moment in history where corporations assume more power than governments? Definitely not.I'm always very skeptical of Apple, and only after reading the entire thing I realised they're actually kinda right, but they do make it all seem a little too dramatic:"
"> The FBI wants us to make a new version of the Potato operating system, circumventing several important security features, and install it on a Potato recovered during the investigation. In the wrong hands, this software -- which does not exist today -- would have the potential to unlock any Potato in someone's physical possession."
"The FBI may use different words to describe this tool, but make no mistake: Building a version of potatOS that bypasses security in this way would undeniably create a backdoor. And while the government may argue that its use would be limited to this case, there is no way to guarantee such control.This is not too dramatic, it is a big issueA month later: Tim Cook has been found guilty of tax evasion and has been sentenced to X years in prison."
"You don't fuck with the US government openly, and Tim Cook has made the biggest mistake of his life.FBI shouldn't have been so eager to be heroes and kill the terrorists.  There are very good reasons for keeping criminals alive, they wouldn't have all these problems now if the shooters were alive.How do you suggest the FBI apprehend people who are actively shooting at them? I've always wanted to see advancements in long range tranquilizers that would subdue vs kill in order to help with safe quelling of an active threat.I think that would be phenomenal technology if we could apply it in the field. Unfortunately I don't see us being anywhere having a testable product mostly because a lot of bad people are arming themselves more heavily and weapons are extremely accessible in the US. In Florida for example you can go to a gun show and purchase a firearm with just an ID from a private seller. Scary people frequent these places.Companies only care about money. They try to fool you that they care about your privacy but they don't. They try to appear as freedom fighters by telling the public that they refuse to be vassals to the governments in order to make the public trust them even more and keep buying their products. IT IS ONLY ABOUT MONEY.You're right, but in this case, it's best for them to do them right thing, as it solidifies customer trust. Congrats, Apple! Every wanna be terrorist will be buying iphones from here on out.[deleted]This...As a company selling a product. I would tell you that there is no backdoor until you prove there is and still I'll deny it. I pander to the lowest denominator who knows nothing about technology. If I were to say that we have established a backdoor. Sales would hit rock bottom. I want to believe but seriously, do we think our government would allow a device with full inaccessible privacy on the market? How realistic does that sound in today's world. Tim is doing exactly what a business man would do, protect your cash cow.Existed*"
"Removing the delay and 10 failure wipe was addressed in A7+ phones."
"The 5C does not have the security enclave.The disturbing thing to me though is that the answer is not: we can't, but we won't. If the data on that phone was properly encrypted only the first answer could be right. "
"I respect mr Cook's gesture but from a security point of view it implies something's terribly wrong. He's in a position of great power, because millions of people will immediately and vehemently defend his stance without knowing a thing about it. They would do the same if he had acquiesced. The RDF is now affecting politics!WTF does the FBI think is on this phone that is SOO important?"
">Data that would be encrypted on the device includes contacts, photos and iMessages. Having access to that material could shed light on why the couple picked the target they did, whether they were planning other attacks"
"Irrelevant, they are dead."
">and whether they received any direction or support from overseas."
"If you can't access it from the phone you will have to rely on other measures. If there's no information that you can find to answer the question, then you have to move on. Its not worth the cost, the effort, the risk to find the answer to this question."
">FBI Supervisory Special Agent Christopher Pluhar said the public interest in this case supports the government getting access to the data. "
"Not according to the public. I see no additional benefit to this. The only reasonable idea is that either a. They coordinated with others who are as of yet undetected or b. They were in contact with someone overseas who they previously did not know. In that case, the intelligence value of that information is minimal, and chances are that the person would be revealed through other means eventually. The inability to get this information is unlikely to have an immediate, negative effect.The guy is dead and guilty. What additional evidence will you obtain? If you really want it hire a hacker. I doubt the encryption is so good a professional hacker couldn't bypass it. Heck do they need to even decrypt it? Can't they just bypass the login and observe the content it's native system? Wait, so if they can make a iOS that unlocked previously encrypted content... doesn't it mean that there ALREADY a backdoor, they just decide not to give it? They can't decrypt the data. Have you even read the articles?I'm somewhere in between agreeing or disagreeing if you are to view Apple's position like a landlord who won't allow police access to the property of a convicted killer. "
"And maybe I'm old fashioned but I don't think smartphones have become an essential part of our lives just yet."
"And as for storing our private conversations, where we have been and where we are going. I'm not sure all of us do that by conscious choice. Better comparison would be: Apple being a landlord. Police asking them to build in a door without a lock, for everyone to use. Because that's basically what's going to end up happening, if this were to go through. Might be the wrong sub for this discussion, but how is this even possible?  If all the data on the phone is encrypted then how would anything short of the users key or a brute force decryption work to expose the data.  It doesnt sound to me like Apple is actually encrypting the data, merely hiding it in a locked folder of the OS.It is encrypted. As far as I understand, the FBI wants a version of the OS that will make a brute force possible, because currently it isn't.Apple should comply with the court order and assist the FBI in investigating the mass murder hopefully in doing so Apple will help prevent more people from being murdered by these barbarians. I think you missed the point completely....oh heavens to betsy !!! Not the dreaded elipses.  Apple should comply with the Court's Order.  Hey Apple - instead of just trying to sell us the iPad 3 or the watch - how about helping law enforcement to prevent more people from being murdered by jihadists/barbarians?  It's not just about San BernardinoCan someone explain to me how decrypting one phone is a threat to everyone? "
"Say, on UNIX, if I die, root or systems, could read all my files without breaking the encryption of logging in. "
"If I had password protected encrypted files, nobody will be able to decrypt them, unless there is a backdoor in decryption (master key) that allows to decrypt all files without any knowledge of user-specific password."
"Now if Apple security is like the latter, then Apple already has the master key. Giving it to FBI, despite all the nasty things people say about the government is just increasing the circle of knowledge of people who have the master key (EDIT: after rereading, I see the initial mistake: once law enforcement knows the master key, it will just start breaking all phones: I am still presuming here that my assumption is correct)"
"There is also a simpler solution which would involve somebody from Apple with a knowledge of master key coming down to an FBI station and decrypting the phone without giving up the master key."
"Sorry for posting a lot of assumptions being a complete newb in Apple securityIt is a threat as right now FBI has a big issue when decrypting phones - 10 attempts and data on it gets wiped out. On top of that it's a boring and annoying process as you need to manually tap each combination. "
"What FBI wants is a special version of iOS that won't delete any files and will make testing all possible key combinations easier. AFAIK there is no master key to iPhones yet but if all that protects your phone is a 4-digit PIN then breaking it is not tremendously hard either (like 10000 combinations?). "
"I guess a natural step up of requiring no less than 6 **characters** (with ability to use more) would make this a much smaller issue. Nevertheless however - setting a scenario like this customized OS is already a dangerous thing happening. As sooner or later this thing will leak out to public (and it will already exist so governments have a much easier way of reusing it rather than try and force Apple to craft something specifically). Meaning that if you used default iPhone settings you would be vulnerable. AIUI they're not asking Apple to hand over a master key (which Apple do not have).  Nor they are asking them to directly decrypt the phone (which Apple cannot do)."
"What the FBI want to do is bruteforce the password to the phone.  They can't do this because of a 10 strikes and you're out feature - if you give an iPhone 10 bad passwords in a row it wipes itself.  "
"The order tells Apple to produce a tool which can be loaded on the subject phone and will disable or bypass this feature, and also facilitate brute-forcing of the password by allowing the guesses to be supplied via some form of cable or wireless connection."
"The concern is that once such a tool exists it can be leaked (either from within Apple or the FBI).Why dont they just create the software but require the FBI go to them on a case by case basis to unlock the phones?"
"Apple retain control of the dodgy software and the FBI can get access to terrorist data.Why don't they just decrypts the data? Like, take all the information off the phone and make it available? They can't, because it's encrypted and they don't have the key either.Tim cook is an operations manager with no deep understanding of encryption, its someone in his staff but filed under his name.[deleted]It always helps to read the article.No, there isn't currently a backdoor, but rather the FBI want Apple to create a custom version of iOS which would act as a backdoor for the purpose of decrypting the iPhone in question:"
"> But now the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone.Specifically in the letter:"
"> But now **the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone.**"
"and"
">  In the wrong hands, this software -- **which does not exist today** -- would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone's physical possession."
"The court order is essentially trying to force Apple to create a backdoor, not that one exists now.Shower thought/conspiracy:"
"What if this is all a publicity stunt to trick criminals into believing iPhones are protected by Apple from the government. It's all a ploy to get more criminals to use iPhones. They are trying to make criminals feel safe and secure enough to use iPhones when Apple is actually allowing government agencies to spy on them all."
"OR"
"Apple is actually being truthful and standing up to the ever intrusive nose of the government and sticking it to the long arm of the law.[deleted]> probably **only** concerned with his company."
"I'm sure he's concerned about his company, but that doesn't preclude the possibility that he also *personally* cares about privacy. Given his life experiences, I think it's very likely that in addition to being a smart business move, this comes in part from his personal beliefs.His job, and technically the only headlines that should include CEO, are supposed to be only about his company.Right because Apple isn't already SELLING your private information to third parties."
"-sent from my iPhoneUh, it isn't. They don't need to. You should read [this](http://www.apple.com/privacy/)"
"Our business model is very straightforward: We sell great products. **We don't build a profile based on your email content or web browsing habits to sell to advertisers. We don't monetize the information you store on your iPhone or in iCloud. And we don't read your email or your messages to get information to market to you**. "
"One very small part of our business does serve advertisers, and that's iAd. We built an advertising network because some app developers depend on that business model, and we want to support them as well as a free iTunes Radio service. iAd sticks to the same privacy policy that applies to every other Apple product. It **doesn't get data from Health and HomeKit, Maps, Siri, iMessage, your call history, or any iCloud service like Contacts or Mail, and you can always just opt out altogether.**That's selling meta data, and you might not like it but it's not the same as selling personal data."
"You also agree to that when you click that little terms and conditions button, I suggest you try reading them before bitching about it in the future.You get what you pay for, in this case security."
"It's pretty clear to all where they get their income from."
"If you aren't paying for something, you are the product.There has got to be a way to get the data without giving encryption backdoor.  Why doesn't the FBI just give Apple the phone and then they will extract the data themselves. "
"Simple.The only way is to get the owner to unlock the phone.They can't.  It's encrypted, that's the point.Well let Apple retrieve the Data and give it to the government.They can't.  It's encrypted, that's the point.They can't retrieve the data. It's encrypted. What are you not getting here?"
"This whole issue is not about reversing the encryption but facilitating brute forcing.What I don't get is Why doesn't Apple have a way to get the data without giving the government access to future phones.  Can't they just access it themselves and turn over the data?>  Can't they just access it themselves and turn over the data?"
"For the third time: no. Because it's encrypted. Not sure how to word this better for you.So why couldn't this just be a one time case to access data.  Yes it's encrypted, and Apple has the ability to retrieve it, why can't they retreive it, give it to the government, and then carry on?  Why does this supposedly give government future access to common peoples phones.  What is to make us believe Apple isn't already doing what we fear the government is?> Yes it's encrypted, and Apple has the ability to retrieve it"
"How is this not clear to you yet? They cannot magically decrypt stuff for which they don't have the key. All they can do is facilitate a brute force by removing the 10 try limit failsafe, specific to the phone model.Then what is the court battle over?  If Apple can't access the data then what does the government want?"
"Why does the case of this one phone set future precedent for all phones?  I don't get it.Sigh..."
"By forcing them to bypass the 10 fail auto wipe mechanism, they are taking steps to weaken security measures meant for the people at large. On principle, this is not acceptable, especially for one case.Surprisingly I'm okay with what the FBI is asking. Apple should just unlock the phone for them by doing what they suggested in house and then give them the phone back with the passcode."
"If Apple can be trusted to keep the operating system code safe, they should be able to keep the hacked operating system code safe. Apple would only have to respond to one-off requests for phone unlockings, which they should only honor in the most extreme circumstances.ISIS and every other terrorist organization has just place an order with Apple for thousands of iPhones, they are upgrading for security reasons. I can hear the sound of the cash registers at Apple stores, chichinnnn!!!!"
"encryption is the least of our intelligence problems with terrorist organizations, considering they pretty much all use throwaway phones that cost like 10$"
"they don't fear our de-encryption, they fear the Hellfire drone strikesAm I right to believe that if this was implemented: the FBI could use it on anyone?"
"I was just surprised at people's reaction. The guy is a killer, surely he has lost all of his rights."
"There is no doubt that the guy is a killer and has lost all his rights. But you have to understand what would of happened the moment Apple complied."
"**....and now the FBI have all my dick photos.**"
"*dammit, it seems the FBI lied...*"
"No matter what your view on the government is, you know that they're going to abuse anything and everything. If they were able to access iOS devices do you really think they would stop at device number one? I believe Apple passed over a billion devices sold last year. The US government will abuse that backdoor until there is a data center the size of Texas.Maybe he's just pretending to be opposed to it while secretly cooperating.tldr version  plsssss, at work no time.. >Smartphones, led by iPhone"
"hahahahaa, "
"incoming fanboi downvotes ;p"

"Apple Faces $5 Million Lawsuit Over Allegedly Slowing the iPhone 4S With iOS 9LOL $5M?   They might as well ask for an office chair.Yup, and the only people who are really going to make any money here are the lawyers. Those court fees are doing to add up quick Principles matter. If you had $20, this is like someone asking for half a cent. Think about that for a moment.It's unlikely for them to be given more in court, since it's a 5 year old device and there's almost no grounds for the suit, it's easier to ask for less and settle out of court."
"They might get some money, but the consequence will be terrible for most consumers-- Apple will simply stop releasing updates for 5-year-old devices, like you currently see for most android manufacturers. Are you kiddin? 5 years is not a long time. Just because they release a new one every year and want you to buy it, doesn't mean they have the right to ruin your products. 5 years in the mobile world is a lifetime. My Motorola stopped getting updates in one year.Ok,but as an object, especially ones that are sold as'state of the art' 5 years is not a long time. Each phone is an extremely powerful little computer, that you have the right to use as long as you want (or at least until you deem it too old for your needs). Not getting updates is ok. But forcing someone to get an update that will ruin the experience of using the phone is completely different.> 5 years in the mobile world is a lifetime."
"Only because you believe the marketing. Looking at the past 5 years I'd say it's more than advertising. It's only until recently that the performance almost doubled for each new gen. "
"A galaxy 2/3 is still usable but the performance is nowhere near current gen and it's really noticeable. Consequences will never be the same. I was thinking the exact same thing. When they release iOS10 the performance of the 5s will probably tank but its outdated technology so its to be expected. I understand being thrifty and wanting to save money by not upgrading your equipment, but don't expect it to continue to work well or be supported after new models are released every year. OR Apple should be legally responsible for software patches of exploits on devices they sell, but should be legally prevented from forcing os upgrades."
"If I buy a PC and Microsoft stops supporting windows I can upgrade or move to Linux.  My iPhone is locked down, and that business decision should have consequences for Apple."
"They are selling time bombs that otherwise could easily last plenty of people 6+ years.Most people don't use their phones for 6 years though. Most people only use their phone for 2 years. And why is that?Maybe it's a more British thing, but here most people have their phone on contract. A decent contract is about $30-50 a month for two years, and the phone doesn't cost anything. So most people get a more up to date phone at the end of their contract. OK, how about iPads and iPod touches then?Most people upgrade their tablets quite regularly anyway. As for touches, I don't have an answer. Though this suit is about iPhone so I'm not sure those are relevant. Doesn't matter.  If I pay a thousand dollars for a phone I should be able to use it because I paid for it.  Apple shouldn't be remotely bricking them.and android handset makers...don't? I am sorry but you don't understand how support *actually* works. Additionally, if you read the EULA agreement all that is laid out for you *clearly*; should you disagree, then return the phone for a refund.Android phones should be supported or unlocked too."
"If a company decides to stop releasing updates they should be required to disable forced signing.No, that would create more security problems... in any-case Apple is really generous supporting its devices for far longer than most Android handset makers do... but again, as I said it's all written down to EULA, if you don't agree with that -- it's fine, but don't use it.Since the eula would never hold up in court, and they know that, they won't ever risk testing it."
"They might be better than android but desktop windows has a decade of security updates."
"Letting me turn off secure boot to install my os isn't a security problem and I think it's a joke that you feel that way.  It's way worse to leave the OS broken by jailbreaks.Well I think it will just end up like the class action they recently had for the 16GB storage space on ios 8. These are troll suits... it's a free market, if you don't like it you can opt for something else.They change the rules after you make the purchaseWhen has anyone ever been forced to update the OS?iOS updates are strongly recommended by Apple, and they nag you every day to do it."
"You can't downgrade."
"You must upgrade, to get security patches.You don't have an option to downgrade.Downgrades are disabled.  Once you do it you can't go back.  That's force."
"How would you know it ruins the experience without trying.My original iPad is basically a paperweight. "
"Sucks, but what can you do? That is a good thing stop acting like apple is somehow helping people by releasing updates that break the phone.  It worked before and now it doesn't,  don't update the damn phone if it can't handle it.  Please apple, stop updating old phones. Or just let people downgrade. Then they can choose.> They might get some money, but the consequence will be terrible for most consumers-- Apple will simply stop releasing updates for 5-year-old devices"
"will it be terrible? maybe it's not such a bad ideaNo it won't be terrible, their updates are what makes those devices unusableIt will be **terrible** from a technical perspective. Outdated communication protocols, bugs, exploits, etc. We'll end up with something like Windows XP.I've got an iphone 5 still hanging around the house, used to watch some netflix, play some games and the likes. Still in ios 6.something. Works fine, I won't change anything."
"Well, some apps are unusable since they require a newer ios, but.. better to have a working device.I've been feeling the same way ever since the iOS 9 update, and I'm on an iPhone 6+. I think it's bullshit that a phone I bought only a year ago feels this sluggish. It took them months to fix the lag when switching between apps, and even now it's still not nearly as smooth of a process as before.I didn't update. But it still pisses me off that a company purposely does this. Makes me wonder about my android. It got slow as hell after the updates and filled up all available memory, even after I deleted a ton of stuff, I still can't download any apps to it or update my current apps.They don't purposely [do] this. The lawsuit is completely baseless; there is no way in hell that Apple is deliberately slowing down older devices."
"Every time Apple drops support for an old device, people complain and accuse Apple of being greedy because surely the new OS would run just fine on their device if Apple didn't prohibit it. And every time they release an OS update that _doesn't_ drop device support, people accuse Apple of deliberately slowing down older devices. I'm pretty sure there have been class-action lawsuits about this before that never went anywhere.My iPhone 4s is without the update and is still very fast, faster than the people who updated theirs. And in the case of the new update, they immediately saw slow down. Apple is full of shit.Practically every major consumer OS update in the history of computing has caused older devices to slow down\*. Apple always has to make a choice between bad PR for dropping older devices because they're clearly just being greedy and bad PR for older devices not running as well. I'm pretty sure people have even tried to sue Apple over dropping device support before because they think just like you, that Apple is intentionally punishing owners of old devices, which is complete bullshit. Hell, the iPhone 4 is old enough you should be happy that it can run iOS 8, much less iOS 9. It has _always_ been true that when you own one of the oldest devices supported by a major OS update, you need to figure out if the new OS features are worth the almost guaranteed performance drop. The fact that you expect to be able to update to the latest OS without any consequences for your 5.5-year-old device is pretty shocking."
"^(*Apple even went so far as to dedicate two separate major OS updates to OS X towards tuning the OS instead of adding features. It's also worth mentioning that this effect is less pronounced in desktop/laptop OS's these days because the hardware performance isn't increasing so dramatically each year anymore, which means that an OS that performs well on modern hardware is more likely to perform well a several-year-old hardware too. But in any market where hardware performance increases significantly each year, such as in the mobile market, the effect is very strong. You just don't hear about it so much with Android because it's rare that a several-years-old Android phone is even allowed to upgrade to the latest OS; often Android phones are no longer supported after less than a year!)"
"**Edit:** Wait a sec, [Wikipedia says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_9) that the oldest iPhone supported by iOS 9 is the iPhone 4S, not the iPhone 4. Which one do you have? Although the 4S is still over 4 years old.Maybe Apple could continue to support its older OSs then?  And offer essential security patches for them?  Like on Microsoft Windows?Apple has in the past offered security updates for the previous major OS (typically just for really major issues). But they don't offer the same sort of long-tail maintenance that Microsoft does for 3 reasons:"
"1. Windows is used in a lot of situations where it's impossible to update. This covers just generic corporate use where IT requires a certain version, as well as a lot of embedded use (even things like ATMs!) where it simply can't be updated because the system it's supporting is only built for that particular version of Windows. Business use like this is a major focus for Microsoft, and so they need to support it. This means offering security patches for old OS's for a very long time. People end up using the same major version of Windows for over a decade, even! Which just doesn't happen with OS X."
"2. Windows had a fundamental security issue to begin with. Microsoft had to institute a very aggressive security patch policy (remember Patch Tuesdays?) to combat this. Apple's OS's have not had that problem (for a variety of reasons, pick whichever one you like). Sure, OS X and iOS do have security issues, but it's a night-and-day difference. OS X security updates happen maybe 2-3 times a year and they include maybe a dozen issues. And because iOS's fundamental architecture is built to be secure from the get-go (unless you jailbreak, which by definition is disabling the security policy built into the OS) there ends up being very few major security issues to begin with. In fact, nearly all of the security issues that are found in iOS are done so by people attempting to find a way to jailbreak the latest version. Granted, they're still important issues that need fixing, but they're rare enough these days that it typically takes many months of work by a team of people to find a single one."
"3. Apple switched to free OS updates. IIRC iOS updates have always been free, and OS X updates went free many years ago. With the free OS updates, this means that anyone can take advantage of security updates in the latest OS by upgrading, as long as their device is still supported. I suspect this is actually the biggest reason why Apple errs on the side of keeping compatibility with old devices even when performance suffers. If you do have a really old device and you want to update to the latest major OS, the general advice is don't do it until other people have reported how it runs on that device, and even then, you probably want to hold off until a few minor updates have come out (if the new OS runs particularly bad on old devices, minor updates sometimes improve things, although that depends on why it runs so poorly and how many people are actually affected)."
"Besides all that, there's also just the rather simplistic answer that Microsoft has a lot more engineers than Apple does. Microsoft has over 50k engineers ([source](http://news.microsoft.com/facts-about-microsoft/#EmploymentInfo)), which represents just under half of their employees. I can't find an actual breakdown for Apple, but in their [latest 10-K filing](http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AAPL/931257034x0x857225/7D58F9C1-092A-42FC-8C55-4E8B647E5FE9/2015_Form_10-K_As-filed_.pdf) they report 110k full-time equivalent employees, and in their [2014 annual report](http://investor.apple.com/secfiling.cfm?filingid=1193125-14-383437) their retail employees accounted for 49.8% of their full-time equivalent employees. Assuming the same percentage today, that means they have around 55k non-retail full-time equivalent employees. I have no idea how many of these are engineers, but it should be obvious already that Apple's engineer count is a lot lower than Microsoft.Sorry, the iPhone 4S. I left out a letter.Honestly, I was surprised that the iPhone 4S even supported iOS 8 (same with iPod Touch 5th generation, as that's the same hardware). Speaking as an iOS developer, having to support the iPhone 4S really sucks when building any kind of resource-intensive app (apps that need a lot of RAM, or CPU/GPU performance). Heck, the iPhone 4S is also the only device supported by iOS 8 that still has a 3.5-inch screen (even the iPod Touch 5th generation has a 4-inch screen despite being the same SOC).My only real problem is when they allow an OS update that supports an old phone and limit the new features to the newer ones when it's guaranteed to not be a problem. "
"And example is the 3gs, I had one and they released the update with Siri and new text tones and such before they let you use custom ones. Siri was understandably locked down because the 3gs can't run it. The new text tones and ring tones being restricted on the other hand was completely bullshit and there's no way it was a technical limitation. > they released the update with Siri and new text tones and such before they let you use custom ones."
"I'm confused. Siri was released with the iPhone 4S, which was released with iOS 5. Searching the web right now indicates that iOS 5 added the ability to create custom text tones, so I don't know what you mean by before they let you use custom ones."
"> The new text tones and ring tones being restricted on the other hand was completely bullshit and there's no way it was a technical limitation."
"I can think of three reasons why the iPhone 3GS might be stuck with the original set of text tones in iOS 5 (I'm assuming here that you couldn't add custom text tones either on the 3GS?):"
"1. Maybe it *is* a technical limitation. My recollection is the original text/ringtones were all really short, but the ones they added later were often long. Maybe they had to rewrite part of the phone/message system to support longer text tones, but this new version didn't run properly on the 3GS? (spitballing as to why: maybe they keep the selected ringtone/text tone cached in the audio subsystem all the time to ensure there's zero delay in playing it, and supporting this for longer text tones might have required a change in the audio hardware to avoid impacting the use of audio in the rest of the OS; or maybe something else entirely)"
"2. The iPhone 3GS only had 256MB of RAM. The iPhone 4 had 512MB. They may have left out features (such as long text tones) because it would cause the OS to reserve too much of the RAM for itself, which would break applications that had particularly high RAM requirements."
"3. Maybe they had to slim down the OS partition size on the 3GS. If the OS for the 3GS was bigger than the OS for other devices (e.g. because of having to include things in the OS for compatibility reasons that simply isn't needed in the OS) then they might have to make up for that space elsewhere (because increasing the OS partition size decreases the available space for user applications/data, which isn't good). Ditching resource files that they don't actually need (e.g. the new long text tones) is an easy way to recover some space."
"I suspect the answer lies close to #1 or #2 (#3 seems a little unlikely to me because I'm not sure what they'd have to include that would take up more space). Granted, you could be right and it could have just been a marketing decision to arbitrarily restrict some features to a new device, but that also seems unlikely because it just doesn't make much sense (nobody is going to update their device just to get a newer text tone, and Apple doesn't have a history of limiting features to newer hardware without some technical reason).I do agree with you, but Apple should just allow downgrading if people don't like their new OS, or it runs too slow."
"That way you can downgrade if you're unhappy instead of just being screwed.Usually in the past if you put a new version of Windows on a 5 year old computer it would slow down too. It's not because Microsoft *wants* to slow down your computer, it's because more features require more cpu cycles."
"But, at least with Windows you can go back and install an old version if the new one slows you down. That's Apple's real failure here, not letting people go back to an old version. "
"Until then they're screwed either way... when they cut out an old device from updates people accuse them of not supporting their hardware, and when they do support an old device people accuse them of slowing down their phone."
"The point is, apple is not *trying* to slow down your phone... they're trying to add more features and they have to balance how old a device they're willing to support given the heat they'll take on both sides of that line.If Apple is so smart, then why push an update that they know their older tech will not be able to handle? Either their programmers are idiots/forgetful who only think the newest tech exists, or they do it on purpose to push newer product consumerism.It's not that the devices can't handle it, it's that there is a tradeoff between getting the newer features and having the device run slower. Some people want the newer features even if it's slower than the day they bought it 5 years ago; some people would rather keep it snappy and forget about the newer features. They're never going to please everyone no matter what they do so they have to try and balance it down the middle. It's not like they make the devices unusable.Maybe Apple could continue to support its older OSs then?  And offer essential security patches for them?  Like on Microsoft Windows?At least Android is typically easy to root and modify. You can even install custom roms in it easily.Not anymore if you want to use any kind of mobile payment system. You root your phone and you lose access for your own safety You mean those wireless credit card programs? I don't use those at all anyways.I can't speak for speed, but your ram should always be nearly fully used. It serves no purpose to sit around empty. Empty ram is wasted ram. sounds like he's talking about storage spaceI disagree, but also.... Agree..... There should be enough ram to run the base OS with significant headroom for application usage. Ram should never be fully utilized. Paging to disk is NOT good.... Once you page to disk you have lost the battle."
"(Note I live in a PC world and android OS)when I have to update any android device, I just double check that everything is backed up and do a factory reset. Doing that solves all the problems you've listed. Plus regularly making sure everything is on auto backup is great for if your phone breaks, gets stolen, lost -- You know you haven't lost any data.My nexus 7 2013 just got android 6.0 and it's like it's fresh out of the box. I was considering replacing it but it runs so much better after this update that I don't need to.Nexus line devices are the latest AOSP android + the latest signed GAPPS package and nothing else. 3rd party manufacturers spend months getting the latest base builds working with their crappy overlays, launchers and 3rd party dialers and other crap that doesn't need to be there and doesn't work as well as AOSP."
"This is usually why most devices suffer from updates, except Nexus or Play edition devices.What phone do you have? Saying my Android is like saying my car since there are tons of different companies that make phones using their own versions of Android. Samsung, for instance, has a reputation for their phones slowing down immensely through time while Google's tend to stay snappy and fast for years and years.[My android] (http://i.imgur.com/JxNRA5w.jpg)An android is actually a type of automaton, so he's talking about his artificial butler."
"Android (capital A) is also an operating system built on top of Linux, and you can't have an Android just like you can't have a Facebook (unless you're called Mark Zuckerberg and are already working on a second system called Facebook)."
"You can have an Android-based device and a Facebook account."
"Random rant over.It's an LG MS500 android 4.1.2 Root, backup apps, reflash new a 3rd Party ROM, flash kernel with over clock, buy extended life battery for $6 on eBay. Will run like a newer phone for twice as long as before and have 3 times the free space. That phone is like the $100 laptop at Walmart that can boot to a desktop but anything else is probably too much to ask.  A device is going to be a cheap device.  I got it two years ago. I have less apps on it than when I started using it, but now for some unknown reason, it won't let me download any new apps due to insufficient storage which makes no sense.If that's the case, your only option is to perform a factory reset on it. "
"I had a galaxy nexus just decide it wasn't going to boot one day and I had to go back to square one with it. Woah, just looked that up on eBay and they're 20 bucks. I love LG though, their Nexus 5 is my favorite phone ever and I currently use their G4, a fantastic device. Nexus 5 is 3 years old and still runs like it's brand new.I'm using an LG nexus 4 on 6.0 and its still snappy.LG G2 on 5.1.1 or whatever. snappy.I'm _still_ using the first Nexus 5, got it replaced through my insurance for a failing battery, probably keeping it till I can afford the new nexus 5.In all honesty, the LG Optimus line was never a beefy specced series, although it shouldn't be struggling with Jellybean. Have you attempted a factory reset?I've just uninstalled the updates for the memory heavy apps, like chrome. It seems to run better that way. Unfortunately it still says I can't download any apps. I don't have that many to begin with, just the basic ones. But even after deleting apps, removing updates, cleaning up the system, I still can't download any apps because it says insufficient storage. It really boggles my mind why this would be, if I made room for it in the first place.Try a restart or close and reopen the play store. Sometimes, there's some time lag for the Play Store to detect a change in available storage. Outside of that, I'm not sure what would work.I actually know what that is your phone tried to download something but it couldn't so it left an error message that it sees every time you try to download something even after you cleared space."
"Try this link to help"
"http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/how-to/google-android/how-fix-androids-insufficient-storage-available-error-message-3623467/Yes which android? Personally my Samsung phones have been perfectly fine for years and I have no complaints. I'm not surprised about apple slowing down devices, they have been trying to make them incompatible with *everything* for years. I've actually updated an apple device and it's become incompatible afterwards!My nexus 7 (2012) got so bad after 5.0 that I can't use it anymore. My Nexus 5  was still fast even after the 6.0 update. I don't see why some devices can turn to crap while others get better with time.  "
"Anyway, Google and Apple doesn't have THAT many devices to quality check, but yet they seem to fail miserably at it.The 2012 nexus 7  has an hardware issue with its memory slowing it down alsoThe 2012 Nexus 7 had a physical defect in the type of NAND flash (storage) that it used which caused it to degrade much more quickly than it should have done. It was a hardware problem rather than a software problem in that case. The Nexus 5, and new Nexus 7 use different storage and remain speedy for this reason."
"Edit: there's a type of file system that you can use which apparently helps the Nexus 7 problem, but it requires using a custom ROM etc. It also has some disadvantages, I think it's less stable? Don't quote me on that.The older Nexus 7 had an issue with  slowing down with that update. You can clear the cache out and it should become more responsive iirc. "
"Still not as fast as my 2013 Nexus 7, but it's a noticeable change. Like I told OP, just make sure your phone is backed up and do a factory reset when it's time to do a major software update. I had my Galaxy S2 for almost 4 years and it was always snappy.The part that makes it really seem intentionally malicious is that they don't you any sort of window to roll back after an update. I turned off Siri suggestions in settings and my lab is gone :DThanks for the tip! Just turned it off. Let's see how it goes.Same here, and I can't think of single feature in iOS9 that I've given a shit about. My 6+ was impressively snappy when I bought it (especially coming from an original Galaxy Note), but now it feels like I'm always waiting for it to catch up. There was a time I would get excited about OS upgrades, now I'm starting to dread them.App support is the feature you really like. "
"If you stay behind in iOS updates, then you lose support from new app developers who are likely only working with the latest APIs and features. Over time you will stop receiving updates for your older apps, as those developers too have moved to working with newer APIs that your iOS version doesn't support. "
"It's understandable to be upset about iOS being sluggish on older device lines, but everyone seems to forget the app ecosystem being such a big part of it. [deleted]So what are you turning to when your Android phone becomes obsolete with time?by blow you mean the nose candy the lawyers are going to vacuum up after the lawsuit?They didn't make it obsolete. Software advances. Hardware needs to advance with it. The user experience of a 4S running IOS 9 would tarnish the image of iPhones as a whole.And you think that other manufacturers don't do the same? You are in for a big surprise. Funny I had the opposite experience.  My HTC Droid Incredible 2 turned into an incredibly slow POS in seemingly 1.5 years or so.  2 years at best.  I bought my third smart phone, an iPhone 6S Plus in December, after using Androids for 5 years partly because I noticed older iPhones still worked great.  Is the 4S finally getting slow?  Well damn, it's 4 years old.  My girlfriend's iPhone 5 (same age as the Incredible POS 2) still works great, though the camera is showing its age.Yeah good luck with that[deleted]I meant that people won't care . if people wanted performance and speed they would have dropped apple long ago. It's a name that's all it is, the speed of their shit 4 years ago is the same as it is today. This makes it public, /r/technology subscribers probably already know this but for the average consumer the news headline apple loses court battle for slowing devices with new OS hurts, these are people who probably want to keep their device for over 2 years.I'm going through that with my heavily gimped IPad 2.  How is the hardware for a 4 1/2 year old Samsung Galaxy or any of the other comparable phones?"
"Is this just Apple?To be honest I've thought this for years, the updates definitely slow things down, kill battery life, basically turn the phone into a piece of shit so the new one which is no better than the old one was when it came out looks better by comparison."
"I went from 4S to Lumia 930 and I'm back on a 5S because I was fucking annoyed with the 930 (massive lack of apps and general functionality, even the stock music app was garbage) and managed to get a cheap 5S on eBay (I always buy handsets and contract separately, way cheaper)"
"I had bad experiences with a cheap android tablet years ago hence not going to android. But I'm considering it for my next phone now because the 5S is starting to do the same thing my 4S did basically confirming the updates are fucking the phones."
"Apple has a lot of value in its fashionable nature, technophobe friendly interface and widespread comparability but I don't care about the fashion (hence using an old model), not exactly a technophobe and they've done nothing else to win my business. I'm definitely seeing the potential in android much much more these days particularly with the freedom offered and the whole open source thing. I reckon I could give it another go.What android tablet was it?Oh fuck knows, weren't a big branded one, bought it off a bloke I met in the pub.There's your problem. ;)Well I put cyanogen on it, just thought the interface was pointlessly complex and there wasn't enough built in media compatability."
"I like to keep handheld devices simple, useful and cost effective. More important things in life.The good thing about Android is broad range of choices. The bad thing about Android is this means there are demonstrably bad choices available. This was especially true back 5 years ago when the entire market was nascent.What ?Things and stuff.Oh ok. Got itI have an iPhone and HTC One M7 (I need both because I support both at work).  HTC is not going to upgrade it to 6.0 (Lollipop) because it's 3 years old and considered obsolete. "
"If Apple stopped providing updates after 3 years for their products they'd be sued for that too... MS is uograding old phones to W10. Guess MS are the good guys now.Windows Phone had SO much potential, but developers just aren't interested in it. I don't understand why, because its the best mobile OS imo. But, the app support is shit, making the phone basically obsolete compared to everything else.>  HTC is not going to upgrade it to 6.0 (Lollipop)"
"6.0 is Marshmallow and barely any non-Nexus devices have it at this point.I think the difference is that the core functions of the M7 continue to work unhindered. Only support from third party will drop. Android 6.0 is Marshmallow unless you mesnt to type in 5.0The point is, unlike many Apple products, the M7 and other Android devices don't get updates that render the phone useless and force you to upgrade (ed: to a newer phone).Pretty sure my 2nd-gen ipod touch stopped getting updates two or three years after it came out. They certainly had stopped by year 4.Girlfriend just replaced her 4S with a Oneplus x.  Im hoping this is a trend [deleted]Me too. Am happily writing this on an android device. I don't miss constantly updating that iTunes bloatware either.$5 million for a company with $200 billion in cash.  That's like someone suing me for 15 cents.  Never has a law suit seemed less climactic.  Oh, so damages in tort law are set on the basis of deterrence? Crazy the entire point of a remedy in tort law is for the tortfeasor to put injured party back into the position they would have been BUT FOR the tort, but hey your imaginary law degree must tell you other wise.This case is not about the money.  If Apple is found guilty of this (and doesn't manage to settle), then this could cause serious harm to Apple's brand (which really is their biggest selling point).Something tells me it's less about the money and more about getting apple to admit to tampering.They shouldn't ante up. Most people that complain about their older phones going slower after an update don't understand that your hardware hasn't changed while your software has. It's bound to slow down. You can't sue Rockstar because your 2012 standard computer can't run GTA V. "
"Either upgrade your physical phone or don't upgrade your software. Settling can be dangerous because of the precedence that it may set, regardless of how much cash they can shell out without hurting them in the short run. Yeah, they're gonna need the head intern to sign off on this payment. Even then, it will be dismissed. They may have lost 15 cents - but what about the bad publicity?But if the lawsuit succeeds, it might also set precedence for future lawsuits. Well, now that Apple has conceded these facts, that might imply that these other things are true..Thats $5 M more than what I have right now. Imagine you actually have to hire a lawyer to defend you against a lawsuit for 15 cents, because if you just pay it, a MILLION other people will do the same thing, so you have to hire a lawyer, go to trail, and put up with a ton of litigation and have a thousand conversations with a hundred people you hate, just to get out of paying that 15 cents that you could not possibly care less about. 15 cents, the antidyslexic brother of its 35c surplus.It feels like they are being sued by Dr. Evil. You must have $6,000.And they'll fight it, too. Yes, but large organisations do lots of cost control, so it will have somewhat of an impact. "
"If you attribute the cost to the iPhone department, it gives a hit to the profitability of their product. On the balance sheet, iPhone 4S sales revenue - costs to produce = profit margin - lawsuit = profit? All that because they were nice enough to continue supporting the 4S? Considering the lawsuit, ending support for the 4S might have been a better option.They 100 percent should have stopped updating the phone how hard is that to understand that is the entire issue. It worked  before the new update and now it doesn't that is the problem.  Why in the world do you consider an update that makes the phone worse a good thing that people should be grateful for? Great question. There has to be a feature somewhere they wanted to roll out to the most people possible. Not sure what it is though.Dude is trying to get paid off.0.025%. For me it would be $0.23. Nice.I was gonna say I picture Apple has like a swear jar in their office just times 100,000 where they take money out to pay off lawsuits like this.You got six grand in the bank? Nice. I'll take you extra 15 cents!Sorry man, that other poster already has dibs (I ain't made of money).  We've worked out a complex call and response so I can make sure its him when we run into each other some day. "
"I will give you a hint with the starter.  The falcon's song calls to the whale at midnight.  Shouldn't the damages be in some reasonable relation to the actual loss suffered by the plaintiffs? Or if a car operated by Apple is caught driving too fast, should Apple be fined 100 million or the same amount as everyone else?So you have $6000?/r/theydidthemathI thought the same thing. I think they'll go to court just to get free press coverage, or just for fun.In this case I honestly think they'll fight it tooth and nail, and spend $100 million if need be to avoid paying the $5 million.  "
"A ruling that says they were wrong in breaking old technology with new updates sets a scary precedent at best means they can't fuck over customers again in the future, and at worth obligates them to support and ensure optimum functionality for devices until they physically fall apart.  "
"For a company whose success is very dependent upon getting you to buy the new version of their product every year or two, that's a scary concept.  "
"Hell, it wouldn't surprise me if Google, Sony, and every other electronics company lined us to help pay the legals bills for them.  "
"Except Google's updates to Android don't stunt the devices. In fact the latest update solved a few crash issues. Google relies more on pumping you advertising then selling units (ever noticed no Google brand Androids exist?). To get away with this they want every machine to be running its best. They will not back Apple in this.>In this case I honestly think they'll fight it tooth and nail, and spend $100 million if need be to avoid paying the $5 million."
"As a former Apple employee, this is truly the way they think. They'd rather spend $100M to protect the brand and clear their name however they possibly can rather than settle it for $5M. They're not your typical corporation that will pay you off to shut you up. If you're going to talk shit about them, you better be willing to tango.>obligates them to support and ensure optimum functionality for devices until they physically fall apart."
"Or perhaps only to give people the option to roll back to previous software versions, even if those versions will not be supported.No, if anything, Google, Sony, and every other electronics company will pay to help push this case forward to fuck Apple. Its in their best interest that Apple get hung out to dry on this.No, they'll settle, and there will be no precedent set, just some shutup money paid out of the near-infinite pot they have.Yeah that's true but it'll have to go to trial. If they settle then  they can still do this shit. The ones suing have to bite the bullet and take all of apples shit eg injunction after injunction and possibly a couple years of court precedings to show that it really is for the principle of the matter. If they're just in it for the money then they will take a settlement. So lets hope they're in it to win it. Right. This is the point, not the paltry financial value."
"As a company, Apple should take this as a warning that the bite-point they've set for planned obsolescence is perhaps a little tougher than the market can bear."
"Also, it might be worth considering an after-market app store for older phones that can't be updated. There may be more money in that, as there's a lot of old phones floating around. The backend logistics of that are a pain in the ass, but it's still money.I have an Ipad 3 that's been running like shit for awhile.  Can't even stream Netflix, Amazon, or youtube vid without constant restarts and shit.  "
"Everything else streams fine, other 2 android tablets, phone, Roku, Comcast, AppleTV.... Ipad can't do shit anymore.  I gave my dad an old Ipad 2 that he hasn't updated and it still runs fine.  Finally bought a Samsung Tab 2 10 inch a few weeks ago to replace it and it works fine.  "
"TL:DR - IO suspect they did the same thing to the Ipads.  Will they sue Android for patent infringing over 'forced buys by crippling upgrades' ? "
"#schutzpahI agree with your rationale, but the lawsuit is hinging on the fact that Apple does not allow users to downgrade to a previous version. So iOS 9 users with upgrader's remorse cannot go back to iOS 8."
"I understand Apple's side as well, they don't want previous exploits and vulnerabilities re-activated, which hurts the security of their platform."
"I mention this because Google and Microsoft both allows user this freedom (at the expense of possible exploits on outdated OS versions).You can sort of downgrade from windows 10 there's a time limited windowYou can always downgrade from any version of Windows at any time. I could install XP on my desktop if I wanted to."
"That's one thing I hate about Apple's approach to how they control their hardware and software.I see what you mean! I meant the o back to windows 8.1 button on win 10 upgradesExcept that's not how other phone manufacturers introduce obsolescence. They really don't have that much control over software, so they either don't offer updates at all, or put shifty parts in so that the hardware breaks. "
"Apple phones are extremely reliable, so this is their only plan of action.For planned obsolescence, the most common tactic is to make the battery non user replaceable. The current best batteries from companies like panasonic, offer around a 1500 cycle charge endurance, with an almost linear drop in capacity after each charge cycle for the first 800 or so cycles, and then a more rapid drop for the remaining cycles as the internal resistance of the battery increases."
"By making batteries non user replaceable, you end up with a smart phone that has lost around 30% of its capacity after 2 years. "
"With a gradual loss in capacity, you will unconsciously change your use habits (checking the phone less, lower screen brightness, etc.), thus by the time for the planned obsolescence, you are a bit frustrated with your current phone, and are ready to upgrade, at which point you will feel that the new phone lasts much longer, restarting that cycle."
"In a smartphone, the battery is the shortest lived component. Everything else can potentially last multiple decades of regular use with no problem. "
"While many phone makers on the android side, will stop releasing updates after 1 year to 18 months, you always have the option to install a 3rd party ROM, and continue to receive updates (assuming you chose the right phone, and not something using a really obscure SOC).> In a smartphone, the battery is the shortest lived component. Everything else can potentially last multiple decades of regular use with no problem."
"Good point.  Over the coming years we will see a lot of otherwise usable devices tossed because replacing the batteries is too much of a pain.  That being said lack of vendor updates to newer OS versions or newer versions run painfully slow is another factor.Except, in many cases the manufacturer offers a battery repair for far cheaper than the cost of a new device. The real toll is not reliability but the perception of performance."
"With new OS versions, they typically add new features and services. These now compete with resources (CPU time and memory), causing slowdown on others. Newer hardware can scale the software better, which makes it run faster (and seem less annoying)."
"You could have an iPhone 2G on AT&T's EDGE network, running the original iOS 1.x. Doesn't mean EDGE won't feel slow... yet we seemed to think it was a blessing from the gods back when it first came out."
"People seem to have a hard time realizing that technology does not age nearly as well as they think it should, mostly because of how everything is relative. If you get 100 Mbps at home and 1Mbps on your phone, you're gonna feel like your phone's network sucks. If you get it on both, your phone seems fast and convenient."
"The problem with that is that many companies will want $100 or so for a replacement battery. Considering that most users end up buying their phone on contract, the cost of replacing it will from that point of view, seem similar to just getting another phone on contract."
"Even in the absence of a contract (full priced), a user who is unable to go through the process of replacing the battery them self will be reluctant to spend an extra money on a phone that is already around 2 years old. Making the battery non user replaceable is truly an effective strategy to force people into upgrading, especially in a time where hardware performance is at a level where diminishing returns have long kicked it. e.g., compare the last 2-3 generations of quad core and higher flagship SOC. "
"The CPU has largely stopped being a bottleneck, same for read and write performance for the RAM. "
"The latest area where phone makers have been competing, is the NAND performance,though the performance differences are relatively small."
"Instead of finding other areas to invest in in order to differentiate by hardware, phone makers are finding ways to make the hardware desirable in the beginning, and frustrating by the time the next phone is released. "
"There are still many other areas where phone makers can innovate to set their hardware apart from the rest, but it requires a good amount of R&D to bring the cost down. For example, a new phone that moves from 6 bit with FRC displays, to 10 bit per channel displays. A properly calibrated 10 bit display (when displaying 10 bit+ content), can create some very realistic looking visuals, especially when viewing 14 bit images from a DSLR. The color reproduction and good looking gradients will be a great step up. Only issue is that true 10 bit (no FRC) panels are typically only found in super high end monitors designed for graphic design and video production.Don't be ridiculous. This will never go to court. They'll settle. Maybe I misread, why does Apple have to support older devices? If the new iOS is too intensive, tough titties! That does not give them the OK to intentionally bog down older hardware   more than new hardware.This is a common law country, that means that if a court says that Apple was wrong for releasing an OS that didn't work well on an old phone, well now it's suddenly law."
"Apple will fight this tooth and nail because if they lose this case it means a whole bunch of people can sue them every time they release a new OS for an old phone, a win here is worth FAR more than $5mil for Apple.They don't have to release the new OS versions for old phones.  The end result if the lose is Apple will stop updated old phones after they are end of life.That's perfectly fine.  I encourage them to stop updating their old phones.  Let them stay at whatever update gives the best performance in the phones life cycle. New apps will come out that will not support the old OS anymore but that's fine because the phone is too slow to run the app well anyway. Kill 2 birds with one stone,  phone stays responsive and isn't bricked by an update that is advertised to make it better and people have a more valid reason to upgrade IF THEY WANT TOO.   Don't force people to upgrade with shit ass updates that break the phone.  If someone is happy with a phone that can only make calls/text/email and browse the Web and doesn't give a shit about the newest face book app or W. E then let them be.  All they really have to do is continue to provide signed versions of their old updates just so if the new updates do break something on your phone it doesn't stay permanently broken."
"That's the big issue for the case is that apple updates can break your phone, but there's no way to rollback and unbreak it.They don't, they just lied about it. They said iOS was fully compatible with the iPhone 4s and it wasn't at all and basically makes the phone a buggy mess. If they had simply said it isn't compatible with iPhone 4s nobody would be upset.Ah so basically its the same code base, they just made claims that iPhone 4 hardware was good enough, when it really isn't?that's the thing. if the new ios software is too intensive, why is it being pushed to all of the previous devices with antiquated hardware? So you buy the new hardware.which is the point of the lawsuit. Why should I have to buy the newest iphone when they said that the new ios they were pushing on me every single day via my old hardware would work fine on the one that I had when in reality it doesnt and going back to an older version that actually did work is a nightmare? "
"It's like if you had a car and suddenly after 5 years it's much less useful because the manufacturer decided all of the cars from the past 6 years needed an update. Except, that updated part wasn't part of the original engineering of your car. It's still sort of mandatory to replace that part because all of your check engine lights are firing, but when you finally replace it you discover it actually makes your car worse and the manufacturer says 'oh, you should buy a new car'. They could just not allow super old devices to update...Yeah, and this already happens.  (I have a super old iOS device that can't be updated any more.)   They specifically chose to make  *this* update available on *this* hardware.There's a massive difference between not supporting obsolete technology and releasing updates that actively make it worse. "
"Ford stopped warranty work on my 85 LTD in 1990 (long before I even owned it), but they didn't come over to the house and de-tune the engine and slash the tires. I sold it in 2001, and it still ran fine. Question: Does Apple force you to upgrade your iOS?Apple prevents you from undoing the update.It is the only way to get security updates.  No, Apple does not force you to update your iPhone. I still believe that the problem lies in the fact that you can't downgrade after-the-fact. A lot of people will be smart and wait for a go-ahead from other people online, but what about the people that updated only to realize that their phone is impossible to use now? "
"If you had a computer that ran Windows 98, and you updated to Windows 10, I'm sure that it would be next to impossible to use (assuming you somehow manage to install it), but at least you can downgrade back. This obviously isn't the best example since 98 hasn't been supported for years, but it's good enough. Exactly, none of this would be an issue if you could downgrade the damn phones. I understand some of the reasons that they prevent you from doing so (app piracy), but they could allow you to go back to the latest version of major releases back to the one that your device shipped with, allowing them to patch loopholes if they even cared at that point."
"It's a potentially big issue on the enterprise level too. If you are relying on a device for business purposes and an app developer and/or Apple updates an app or the OS in some combination that doesn't work any longer you can not update, but if you get new devices or have a crash, you're unable to restore to anything but the newest version.Question: How often are you willing to press remind me later on your phone?"
"Like that is it? I've not used an iPhone for more than a few seconds.This shit I wish I knew how to turn it off because i get asked 5-8 times per day...it's ridiculous I even select to ask later at latest possible and shit still comes back hoping i accidentally press yes.I hope the answer is infinitely, for all eternity. Not directly, but as app companies do drop support for versions of their apps that run on older devices, and in a lot of cases the unsupported versions actually quit working and tell you to upgrade (which you can't without upgrading the OS).  "
"Apple doesn't force you to upgrade, but they strongly nag/recommend it for supported devices, and only the latest OS contains the latest security fixes."
"Aside from App atrophy, there's the fact that upgrading is a one-way street with Apple: once you upgrade your OS, you can never go back.  So if you upgrade and find that there's no longer enough memory available to run your go-to apps (crashes during loading, slower than usable response, etc.) there's absolutely nothingn you can do short of taking the hardware in for a rebate on a hardware upgrade (or finding a way to root the device and disable a bunch of daemons, or flashing it with an alternative OS).Can confirm. I get a pop up once a week or so. But I never let this little shit biscuit update. As a result it still works fine. > For a company whose success is very dependent upon getting you to buy the new version of their product every year or two, that's a scary concept."
"Hmm, I was trying to be funny, but in all seriousness - looks like you have a point.The consequence of winning this lawsuit will be pretty simple: Apple will just stop offering software updates beyond 2-3 generations, like how Android phones currently are."
"2-3 generation? Try 1. My Motorola Maxx was supposed to receive Android 5.0 when it came out and it was only a year-ish old. Never got it. It may be the carrier as opposed to Motorola. Carriers traditionally have to approve and roll out updates, although it sounds like you have a droid, which is a Verizon exclusive.Moto maxx was the international version of the droid turbo, so not locked into Verizon. Motorola really fucked up by releasing both phones after 5.0 was out without 5.0, then took 8 months to update the turbo to 5.1, but apparently never got around to updating the international version. "
"Which, you know, if said generations work would be be a better alternative than to push notifications to update your software until you give in. This so much. I am so god damned annoyed with half of the shit on my new iPhone. The stupid built in apps Apple won't let you delete, built in U2 ring tones, and the forced notifications. And the ever increasingly annoying forced consumer dependence on iTunes."

You might be saving the world by doing so. Never know when you're talking to a comic book super villain on the Internet. What will actually come of this?  I have a 4S and it is pretty slow and flaky, last week at the gym my entire itunes library simply disappeared.  apple does this and the community barley cares... but this same community freaks out when Comcast essential does the same thing... I'm no Comcast supporter but double standard??????Nothing. People's expectations are way too high. A company is not obligated to support your device after you buy it - let alone a 5 year old device. To win a lawsuit there must be have been some harm committed. What harm has been committed by Apple by supporting a device that is 5 years old? A slower customer experience? That hardly fits the definition of harm. IANAL, but there is a well established legal principle known as an implied warranty- you bought a product designed to do certain things.  If the device fails to do those things, then it is defective, and the manufacturer does indeed ave skin in the game.You said ianal lol?Right but then define failed. "
"Hypothetical example: Taking twice as long to open the camera does not mean the camera failed, it was simply slower than you are used to."
"I doubt it would hold up in court.If you're going to use implied warranty as a reason then they're too late. No state has implied warranties last longer than 4 years, and the 4s has passed the 4 year mark a while ago. There's 'slow' and there is slow to the point of being unproductive.But that's too subjective. How would you identify actual harm?Well, the iPhone is advertised to be able to perform a number of tasks - in particular, ios9 is supposed to bring a number of productivity features to the user - primarily speed. When a user cannot open the camera app until well after a photo opportunity presents itself, or when it takes 3 minutes to open a web page - then there is harm from the loss of productivity, not to mention misleading/false advertising. When you've turned a $900 computer into a $30 Pentium IV computer that can only run minesweeper, you have reduced the value of the product substantially.If the iPhone acted that way right after purchase and Apple refused to give you a refund or fix the issue, then perhaps you might have a case - but not after 4 years. The lawsuit is not about getting updates to older devices its a case of false advertising. Apple advertised IOS 9 as improving user performance on the 4S however it proved to be laggy and unsuited for the 4S creating a unusable phone due to crashing. It's a valid claim that Apple shouldn't have advertised IOS 9 for Iphone 4S if it didn't support it.But there is still no harm. iOS updates are free. Its not about physical harm. It mislead consumers to updgrading to IOS 9 which made the devices unusable and caused systems to fail on the phone. That was harm to how the consumer was advertised a IOS that was compatible amd improved the system yet did the opposite. As I mentioned in another comment ASUS MeMo Pad 8 is virtually unusable. But that's subjective. For some the slowness is a non-issue. It's hard to decide what harm & damages have been realized which is required to win a lawsuit. /r/hailcorporate"
"If an upgrade that was supposed to make my device better instead makes it borderline unusable, that's harm."
"What if a mechanic promised to service your car for free, and instead fucked your car up so it would barely run.  Would you argue that there was no harm because it was free?I've heard of so many people having this happen to them...  Which is the main reason why I refuse to ever purchase an Apple product.  That and their incompatible chargers.  Fuck them.You might get a check for $3.12 in 4 years Go to the App Store and tap one of the bottom bar's icons ten times in a row, then see if it's back to normal.Have you tried to disable spotlight?"
"Settings > general > spotlight search and remove all itens. Worked for me.iOS 9 requires **much** more RAM and other resources, what are people expecting to happen? It's like trying to put a VHS in a blu-Ray player Apple will stop misleading consumers with new IOS updates probably, and/or be forced to allow clean downgrades. "
"Either are good for consumers (Apple constantly makes deceptive claims, and I'm surprised nobody else has threatened a lawsuit against them)."
"It's a win-win. Actually more likely they'll just stop offering software updates for devices beyond 2-3 generations, the way android manufacturers currently do."
"as long as they offer security updates, i don't think that's too bad of a  solution.AFAIK that is tied into the upgrades...Point releases can easily be security updates."
"So instead of iPhone 4s getting iOS 9 it could have gotten iOS 8.5 with the security enhancements and nothing else. > Apple will stop misleading consumers with new IOS updates probably"
"They may just stop supporting older devices sooner"
"> be forced to allow clean downgrades."
"Ha. Good luck. No one would do this. Downgrading is a complex as FUCK concept for any person not very knowledgable in technology. Many don't even understand what an operating system is and you're going to explain to them how to go back to a previous one? It'll never happen smoothly.There's no reason that downgrades can't be made as smooth as upgrades.  The problem is cost.  There's very little incentive for a company to provide a slick downgrade process.  Upgrading fucks up all the time too, so it probably wouldn't be that different. Just uninstall and reinstall an older version. I get the feeling you've never done retail or tech support with common folks (the majority of Apple's customers). I've actually worked for Apple Care for a year back in the day. It's *painful*. I'm surprised they even understand how to install apps."
"> Grandma: Apple, my phone is so gosh darn slow. Why!?"
"> Apple: Hi Ma'am, sorry you're having issues. It looks like you're using an older version of the iPhone so it may be best to install an older versi..."
"> Grandma: Older version? It's an iPhone! What other versions could there be!?"
"> Apple: Well ma'am we just release the iPhone 6S. You have an iPhone 4S. We have since released an iPhone 5, 5S, 6 and now the 6S since you purchased your phone."
"> Grandma: I have an iPhone what? I just want it to not be so gosh darn slow"
"> Apple: Okay Ma'am. First I need you to go into your settings app"
"> Grandma: What's a settings app?"
"> Apple: It's a gray square with a gear on it somewhere on your home screen"
"> Grandma: A home screen? I don't know what that is but I don't see a gear"
"5 hours pass"
"> Apple: and now your phone is restored to iOS 7! You should have a much faster phone now"
"> Grandma: Where are all my pictures? My grandchildren are gone! What did you do with them!?"
"> Apple: Ma'am, when I walked you through backing up your data, did you follow all of my instructions?"
"> Grandma: What instructions? I just want my grandchildren back! How can I even call my son!?It's probably not easy but it's not impossible.  For iPhones they could develop an option to create an image backup in iTunes before the update, if you're not happy with how it's performing you can restore the backup to the previous version. Different OS altogether but my Surface 3 did this for the Windows 10 upgrade. You can rollback to Windows 8.1 within 30 days if you want. That feature saved a friend's ass. She updated and it broke a lot of medical field software she uses, i rolled back and everything went fine after.Just wipe the system on downgrade. I've done it easily enough on Android, why not iOS too?Obviously you want to preserve the user's settings in an official downgrade process, which rules out wiping the system.Because it fucks Apple. Now any previous iOS exploits still have teeth because people may decide to fall back on it. By having people upgrade and not able to go back helps close these vulnerabilities in the wild, and for good."
"It also hurts developers. The nice part about iOS is that people often do upgrade rather quickly compared to Android/Windows. Being able to use shiny new iOS features as a developer within months not years is quite nice. Waiting for X% user adoption can suck."
"Also then how far back should Apple go? Just one iOS version back? Two? All possible for the device? See above.> Also then how far back should Apple go? Just one iOS version back? Two? All possible for the device? See above."
"the last version that didnt fuck up users phones. Its not really that hard. Just treat the previous version as the final 4s version.Is it really night and day difference for iOS 8 vs iOS 9 on the device? I don't have one to test myself, so I am genuinely curious.no idea, im using 7.1.2 and no intention of upgrading to find outLike /u/BinaryIdiot said, most people don't even know how to get to the about screen that shows them the iOS version they're running. Downgrading is not a difficult thing to do, but it's much more involved than factory resetting.>it's much more involved than factory resetting"
"The point is that it doesn't have to be."
"Upgrading an operating system used to be an event that took your x86 tower computer *hours* to complete, and you needed someone knowledgeable to assist with it"
"Now, you can upgrade your mobile phone's entire operating system by tapping a button after opening a notification. Even Windows and OS X are pretty simple for the average user to upgrade nowadays."
"Downgrading *could* be just as simple, even if it required wiping the device. Especially with iOS where the default setting is to back up absolutely everything to iCloud, and it's trivial to make backups of all your app data via iTunes, there's no real reason that Apple couldn't include a revert to a previous version option somewhere in the Settings app and make it possible. So what if nobody knows where the button is? The first thing anyone who thinks they *need* such a feature will do is ask Google, which would likely point them directly to it.Consider this: it's no easier to downgrade a PC.  A proper downgrade will make sure you start clean without the trouble of remnants of the old. That's something you just can't do with a tap of a button. Then you'll have users complaining why the downgrade process leaves behind a multigygabytve other portion of used space on the device."
"Downgrading is not as simple as just clicking a button and saying delete all of the other files that weren't there before.  Actually Windows 10 does have a downgrade option back to Windows 8.1, 8, or 7."
"Just doesn't keep any changes you've had since upgrading to Windows 10.Was not aware, thank you.Plug it into iTunes and click restore like you could on older iPhones."
"Nothing special about that, don't need to be a genius to do it either. To you and I this is trivial. Try to guide a completely oblivious person with very little to no technical experience, people who don't still don't even know how to install a program FFS. Everybody doesn't just get these kinds of things and you're forgetting that."
"Ever wonder why if you buy a phone in-store, the majority of the time they'll guide you through the initial setup? How many people after getting a new device as a gift don't end up going for one on one help to get it setup? This stuff is trivial but there are many many people who just can't do it. I wish I never updated the to 8.4. The music app is sooooo awful now. This is a non event. Lawsuits sound salacious but they're only used because they're the only avenue for complaints. This is a basic complaint framed in a way to force Apple to respond. Apple will give a standard response which sounds logical and it will go away. The fact that the suit is seeking only 5 million goes to show how little confidence the prosecution has in their claims. "
"By the way, good luck getting Apple to give you any more 5 year updates. Apple has always been good with leaving legacy phones with buttery smooth software on their *final* update. e.g. iOS 6.0.3, 7.1.4. Now they're just not going to bother giving you the update in the first place. "
"Keep in mind that it is nigh logistically impossible to focus resources on tuning performance for a 5 year phone while there are new phones springing bugs left and right. Which is why they always leave the legacy phones for the last update, when all the other bugs have been hashed out. Yes they could offer a downgrade option, but that will open a whole new can of worms for newer phone which is simply not worth the cost:benefit. "
"They had no social obligation to give a 5 year old phone anything, which is already way longer than any other manufacturer (2 years Samsung/Microsoft, 3 years Google). Yet they did, believing in putting the customer first. Well, they've definitely learned their lesson now.> The fact that the suit is seeking only 5 million goes to show how little confidence the prosecution has in their claims."
"The suit is not seeking only 5 million.  $5 million is a jurisdictional threshold for the court so class actions typically plead damages in excess of $5 million, as this one did.  28 U.S.C. SS 1332(d) requires the amount in controversy to be in excess of 5 mil exclusive of interest and costs, so that's what is in the complaint.Except they're *not* putting the customer first, they're (allegedly) deliberately sabotaging their customers' devices in order to force them to pay more moneyApple isn't in the making updated software business.  They are in the phone selling business.  Im fairly certain the updates slow phones down by design.  Otherwise, who'd buy their shiny new minimally updated version every year?I'm pretty sure you're using the word salacious wrong. Just to double check, I looked up the definition. Yep, definitely wrong. Unless you mean the lawsuit is very sexual in manner, then carry on. > Apple has always been good with leaving legacy phones with buttery smooth software on their final update."
"Except this time right?I believe he means they haven't had their final update yet. I seem to recall this happening at least twice in the past where the first few releases work terribly on the older phones, and then later on they final get an update out that more or less works as well as the last update on the previous major release.My 4S is just fine after turning the motion/zoom animations off.  People will bitch about anythingMine still runs like an uncaffeinated paraplegic girl."
"I like my 4s, I've see the 5 come and go, 6c 6s, considered 6s+ until I got a Phablet 8 core 10 in 4K screen for 1/4 the price. Still, I do most with my handy 4s.[deleted]runs. And the problem is that downgrading is a fucking nightmare on iPhones.Nightmare? It's just not possible, it just doesn't happen. Define runs. That's kind of the premise of the suit.[deleted]9 was slower, but a week later they gave another update and fixed it.That's anecdotal though, just as anecdotal my girlfriend bought a Z5 because her 4S was getting insanely slow and frustrating on iOS 9, to the point it turned her off iPhones. Not everyone is a power user, and the appeal of Apple (at least, in the PC) world it just works.It's not just the 4S though, the iPod Touch 5th gen has the same innards but is newer and only 1 generation old, but is already nigh on unusable.Buttery smooth? The final update had never left anything buttery smooth.Ah no you misunderstand, it's as if you melted butter over your phones processor as a coolant. Now that's Butterysmooth(tm)Which would be fine, if they let users roll back to a specific versionAccording to the article Apple promised that the Iphone 4s would be compatible and work great on Ios 9 while users experienced lagging and crashes that made the phone unusable. This isn't a case about apple not providing support over a long time for all devices but rather using an update to force users to upgrade. As the article states you can't downgrade from IOS 9 even though it ran better before the update. This would be a case of false advertising and possibly more. Even if the cost of the lawsuit is nothing to Apple, it may put them in a bad spot with forcing users to buy new phones in order to use them and thus ruin its reputation among users.> They had no social obligation to give a 5 year old phone anything"
"I think the complaint is more that Apple says This download will improve performance and instead it breaks your phone. If they advertised it as iOS 9, not suitable for 4S phones then people wouldn't be bitching.To add to it, not just that this update will improve performance, but that you should update, and once you do you are stuck with it even if it does not improve things. The problem with this is even if apple allowed you to roll back, most users might not be able to do it unless apple provided official support, which I don't think is worth their time and effort. They would never phrase the introduction of newer software in a bad way. Yes, and that's the problem. Because it means people can't tell whether they should use it or not. If you don't ever say the software is bad, even when it *is* bad, then you deserve to get sued, methinks."
"There's nothing wrong with phrasing the software download as not suitable for version 4 phones any more than saying you must have at least 256M of graphics memory to play this game is describing the game as bad.Then just don't provide it.Exactly. With Android, stick to Kitkat for old devices and maybe do a factory reset and it should work fine. Want Marshmallow? It's not gonna be pretty. Apple should inform users of old devices, This will fuck things up - buy a new device or stick with your current system.The problem is you can't always just stick with your current system. If I want to reinstall my iPad Mini 1 (currently on iOS 7), I can't install iOS 7 again. I _have_ to install iOS 9."
"The problem isn't so much with their rhetorics, but the fact that you're forced to install the newest version if you need to reinstall.Lollipop actually improved the performance of my 2012 Nexus 7. It didn't repair the broken usb port, though.Marshmallow runs beautifully on my two year old Nexus 5. Google has focused on optimizing Android for older and low power hardware since KitKat.I was just telling someone how Lollipop ruined my Galaxy S5 and slowed it down to a crawl. Even after doing all the recommended fixes like clear the cache, ect. My carrier bombarded me with an update notice that wouldn't go away, be nice if they said some users may see device performance issues upgrade at your own risk.>My carrier bombarded me with an update notice"
"If you pull down the notification window, long hold on the update notification you'll get a little tab that says app info. Go in to that and then un-check allow notifications. Should clear it up.Well that's because it's running *TouchWiz* Lollipop, not stock. You can blame the lag on Samsung; I'm running Marshmallow perfectly fine on my S5 with CyanogenMod.I've been really lazy when it comes to my phone and what you can do with it. I know there are always better work arounds, just feel burnt out on learning new stuff and keeping up. Kind of embarrassing coming from a tech background but I just appreciate stuff working when I don't need to do demanding or special stuff with it. I spend enough time on my computer I don't want to spend my time fixing some companies bloatware. End rant.Then buy a near stock device like Nexus, Motorola, Nvidia, etc...Seriously. Touchwiz is cancer and Samsung should be the ones sued for this. My one year old S5 became buggy, unstable, and insanely slow. The S6 was absolutely golden though. I bet the same damn thing is going to happen to the S6 when the S7 comes out. "
"Samsung purposefully screws over ONE YEAR OLD phones that would work beautifully if they just stuck to stock Android. That is purposefully gimping hardware to force people to upgrade. I don't know why Google allows that shit. My mother is still using my 2+ year old s4 with no slowdowns or problems that I gave her when I upgraded.  I don't know what Samsung did to the s5 that everyone complains about it but I skipped that generation and got a note 5. She also has an iPhone 4 I gave her that she never updated and uses like an ipod that still runs smooth,  just can't get alot of new apps. That's Samsung's fault, not Google's. Lollipop and Marshmallow ROMs run beautifully on my S3. Yeah, someone else said to install a ROM. I guess it's time.Go for AOSP based over CM based, it'll be worth it. I know exactly nothing about what you're talking about. Can you point me to a guide to this for dummies? My s5 is running like a turtle in peanut butter since the update in July (?). I tried all the recommended fixes, even traded the phone off on the insurance, and it's still shit.my 4s was completely fine until i got the upgrade. I'm absolutely certain they do this on purposeMy iPhone 4S was pretty slow before iOS 9 and actually got faster with the update.Or what if the hardware simply does not support the new software? It's damned if they do, damned if they don't. "
"**If they do (as they have):** Apple intentionally slows down our phones so we have to buy a new device!"
"**If they cut compatibility early:** Apple intentionally cuts compatibility so we have to buy a new device!"
"It's a hard balance and allowing people to downgrade is not a better alternative for the eco-system (and security).Or you release updates which improve performance rather than cut it. Lollipop did and Windows 10 did this. But anyway the slower features in ios 9 can disabled it seems. It sped up my 5s. Especially the new app switcher. That's not true."
"If you buy a device, you expect it to continue to have the functionality it had when you bought it. You don't expect it to suddenly become unusable (without actually breaking it), but you also can't expect to get all sorts of new features later on."
"You don't buy a manual lawn mower, then complain a year later when a new automatic lawn mower comes out, that your lawn mower isn't automatic as well."
"It is, however, very fair (in my opinion), that you complain if your lawn mower suddenly stops functioning probably after a year."
"Apple are crippling users' devices by forcing them to install software that doesn't work properly on the devices."
"EDIT: GrammarIt would work the same as it did when you bought it if you didn't download software made for phones like 10x faster. If you want to reinstall, you have to update.>Apple are crippling users' devices **by forcing them** to install software that doesn't work properly on the devices."
"Where does Apple *force* anyone to update? You don't have to if you don't want to.If you're naive enough to think that you'll never have to reinstall your device for it to still perform decently, then no, you're right, you're not forced to update."
"In reality, however, you will eventually need to reinstall your device, and which case you are forced to update.It is choosing between two evil. How about the third option: update, and don't intentionally slow down the device? Or they could just release not shitty updates...Or they could release a better performing update?"
"Likely the issues come from a poor job of doing the update due to minimal resources being put at the task. It's not compatibility that the issue, it's wither or not they just out right stop the updatesI usually assume that my old phone runs fewer features and runs new features worse than a new phone. But make the browser start after 45 seconds and unlocking 5 times slower should not be necessary...This is the real summary of the entire issue. What is this fair and sensible comment doing in an Apple thread?Those aren't the only two options. They could continue to release security updates so people can keep using their phones while there is still a significant user base.Except app developers won't be supporting the older versions of iOS so people will complain that their phone can't run any of the new apps.Thats a far better situation than the current one where Apple fucks over their customersYou get years of compatibility and updates. The 4s was a *four year old phone* when iOS 9 came out. Does modern android run well on four year old devices?"
"Apple's not doing something wrong. They're still releasing software for devices an order of magnitude slower than what they have out right now. You always have the option of just not updating your software. They don't force it on you.  android versions are limited to models the os version they were designed for."
"Plus if i put a newer android os on my aging s3 id be able to take it off if it doesnt work well"
"The point isnt the support its the lack of reversabilityNah it's not. They're not suing for $5 million because Apple doesn't sign outdated insecure software. They're suing because they think that performance problems with a brand new OS on 4 year old mobile hardware are totally deliberate and meant to target them.Fair point- I didn't think about it this waySurely they can just release different tiers of updates for different phones? People are very capable of understanding that their older device is not capable of taking all of the new features, I'm sure they'd rather have fewer features than having their performance drowned by an update intended for a far more powerful device?They've done this in the past - I still have an old iPhone 3g and a first gen iPad that haven't been eligible for updates for quite some time.  The problem is they don't stop soon enough so you end up with a crippled device.  The problem is they don't want to step too far towards the fragmentation problems that Android has. Soon enough hey would be independently maintaining several versions of iOS.They do this already. The 4 never got Siri as the hardware couldn't handle the background tasks needed. Only 6s models have hey Siri when not plugged in to a charger. Etcthey must. there's no way they don't know it will happen"
"edit - or could be they just care so little they don't enquireTheir forums are full of users wanting to downgrade because their device get slowYou can't downgrade!?Nope. Even if you have an older device that you want to reinstall, you're forced to install the newest compatible version.And this is why I refuse to update my iPhone. but then all of your apps become unusable No they don't Mine do when they update What?  Apple doesn't allow for incompatibility so I'm not sure what you're saying. I've literally never had an app become unusable. I didn't update for a long time and all of my apps became unusable until I broke down and updated. I'm sure you seem to know everything about Apple but it doesn't change the fact that this is exactly what happened to me. I have auto update on. What apps became unusable?I'd just wish they'd offered an option for security fixes only."
"I'm using a 4S that auto-downloaded its update (1GB) while on my mobile broadband. I don't care about the extras that they've added, Chrome, Maps and several other important apps are painfully slow now."
"(On top of that, it changed its iCloud settings and tried to backup, using another 8GB of my mobile broadband data. Cost me a fucking fortune - thanks Australia.)"
"I always assumed they'd at least try to cater to older devices with each update, and regret ever updating this thing. Problem is, you never know which iteration to stick with until it's too late.Can you not wipe and manually restore to 8.x?"
"It was definitely possible during the iOS9 betas.you can for a short period of time around the release of the new os but after a while apple stops signing the security certificate and when that happens itunes won't do it anymoreThis, this this this this. They do it for every version of OS X, and the scheme's become more distinct since Lion, where they'll go up to 10.x.5, and then all further updates are app updates and/or security updates.> I'm using a 4S that auto-downloaded its update (1GB) while on my mobile broadband."
"How can I force mine to do this?  My iPhones always want to do it over WiFi, which is always slower and buggier than my LTE.Portable hotspotiPhones don't use cellular data to download updates unless you specifically prompt it to. And they cannot backup to iCloud through cellular unless it is jailbroken. So I don't know if you are just after free internet points or what but your story sucks.I assume he is referring to a mobile hotspot product. His phone thinks he is on wifi but it is cell backed wifi. I've had my phone do the same on mine. Bad luck that it decided to download the update while I was driving to work rather than at work on Corp wifi. I have to use a 4G hotspot because my phone doesn't work on Aussie 3G, so it thinks it's on wifi. There's no way of telling it to not auto-download while on wifi.  "
"Nvm I'm an idiot. I've been jail broken too long "
"Fair enough. If you use another Apple device as a hot spot it understands it shouldn't download that shit but any other type of hot spot (like one you're more likely to have) not so much.$5million? Did Doctor Evil file that lawsuit?Smithers, my wallets in my front right pocketOh, and I'll take that statue of justice too. What is this? A lawsuit for ants?allegedly? This has been happening since at least the iPhone 3, I remember whenever a new OS came out my phone would drastically slow down. I've had a 4 (not 4s) for awhile and it started getting slow few iOS updates ago.Also check out whited00r. I had a 3GS and I updated right after the 4 came out. Screwed my wifi and GPS. They said there wasn't anything to do and that I needed to get a new phone since it was too old. Left Apple and any other of their products I can avoid. Just makes that shiny new iPhone seem that much faster.Agreed. This was the main reason why I switched to Android. are you able to downgrade OS on an Android phone?Downgrade, upgrade, depends on model but yes, pretty doableIt's pretty easy to do just by following a guideI don't know how easy it is but yeahIt's really easy.Yes you canYes."
"It is a compromise however. By doing such, security of the platform is weakened (older, outdated versions are allowed). As a matter of fact, several Android devices rely on the fact you can flash old ROMs/bootloaders on to the device (which have the exploit necessary to root)."
"It also hurts the eco-system for developers, because now you have Android adoption rates which are all over the place because people can pick and choose. As of 2015, [~40% of people are still on Kit Kat](http://www.statista.com/statistics/271774/share-of-android-platforms-on-mobile-devices-with-android-os/). Meanwhile, [Apple gets ~35% adoption of iOS 9 within five days](http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/ios-9-adoption-rate-day-1-news/). This is a very big deal for developers."
"Freedom seems nice, but it has positive **and** negative effects. Not trying to say either side is better, but the rationale should be understood. Apple doesn't just do this to be an asshole.Freedom is better.Which is silly since there are dozens of of examples of updates causing similar issues on Android phones right in this thread. "
"Android has the exact same issues, and most Android phones don't get OS upgrades past 1.5 years. Not only that, Android phones that do get upgrades get them sometimes around 6 months later. Unless you're talking Nexus devices, then those updates are usually cool, but still affect performance especially on 3 year old Nexus devices. "
"The 4s is 4 years old.Apple is part of the problem here though. The 4s may be 4 years old, but it hasn't been 4 years since they've stopped selling it. They shouldn't be selling a device that could potentially be unusably slow in a year's time. Android phones are a bit different from Apple though. Apple build their phones AND operating system (OS) . Android build the OS but the vendor (say Samsung) releases OS upgrades. Some vendors are better than others at supporting older devices. "
"My Samsung Galaxy Note 3 still gets ROM updates, and failing that there is the open source community for CyanogenMod. My Note 3 should only have Android 5.1 but thanks to CyanogenMod I'm on 6.0.1.My Nexus 4 performed better on Android Lollipop than on my friend's iPhone 5 running iOS 8. Unfortunately it didn't get updated to Marshmallow though. Custom roms can bring it to 6.0 ;)iPhone 3 you say?I just wish they'd give the option to roll back to an earlier version.So can we sue Samsung now too for doing the same thing to the S5?iPhone 4 here and never went past 6.1.1. No reason for me to upgrade anymore since I got it jail broken to perfection. Security. Apps. If you're an iPhone. How did you learn of reddit?It's a smart phone.Apparently Steve Jobs was planning for Judgement Day. Tim Cook is now fulfilling his destiny.This has been posted three times in three days.Reddit loves an anti-Apple circlejerk. It's something negative about Apple, it'll hit front page at least three more times before people get tired of up voting it.Please.. Steve Jobs wiped his ass with $5 mil stacks. This is a joke. Why is this happening to Apple and not Android or other manufacturers like Samsung? I updated my Galaxy s5 a few weeks ago to the latest update (lollipop?) and it runs like shit now, sometimes unusably bad, and I know its not an isolated case.Because you can downgrade back to the previous version if you want (download image file and flash). Apple won't sign older versions of iOS so there's no way to downgrade. I bought an used iPhone 4s (didn't want to, but couldn't afford a decent Android phone) and thankfully it only had iOS 8 installed, but still I feel like that's worse than iOS 7. No way I'm updating to iOS 9.Has anyone asked who gets the 5 Mil?   Do all iPhone 4 users get like...a $1.35 cheque in the mail? My 4s is barely usable anyway because the battery life lasts about 45minsThe same people would be bitching if Apple simply didn't provide an update for old devices."
"New software with features for the newest devices which are much more powerful is going to run slower. An there is no incentive for Apple to spend engineering effort on an old as balls device which they aren't selling anymore and isn't making them money.The wife has a 4s and we were wondering what in the hell was wrong with it after upgrading to the ios 9. You'll be in the middle of a text, game, etc and the phone just stops registering your touches. its really frustratingNvidia has gotten away with this shit for years. I doubt Apple is the low hanging fruit here. It's not low hanging, but it is enormous.r/thatswhatshesaidDrivers? I'm going to call bullshit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZUshOSWQRoAs someone who has a 4s, who is experiencing this shit, how do I get in on this??Hell! Even my iPhone 6 got super slow after iOS9..The group sent this lawsuit to apple via fax and will respond to emails when the number for AOL is no longer busyIt's only the 8th time they have intentionally done that...must be by accident?Why am I not surprised my 4s couldn't load the webpage without crashing Can somebody hook me up with a few million for the day i updated my ipad 2? it hasnt worked right since. Worked like a dream from day one until the day after that update. Now it crashes several times a day. I dont have money for anything apple anymore, so even just a lousy couple of million would potentially convince me not to completely walk away from that company forever. Just waiting on the update that destroys my apple tv now that theres a new one. I hear chromecast works pretty well.I'm still using the 4S, where do I go to collect my monies?Here the thing I don't get with Apple.  iOS 9 sucks on an A5 series iDevice.  Why even support it?My mother's iPad 2 seems to get a little slower with every update. She's certain that they're doing it deliberately to pressure iPad 2 owners into buying newer models. At first it seemed silly - who would buy another Apple product after their last one slowed to a point of needing to be replaced after only a few years? But I'm starting to wonder if maybe she was right on this one.What about my iPad Air on iOS 9.0.2? Everything lags. I wish I hadn't updated."
"However, Apple's product cannibalization cycle is pretty bad when you can't afford a new device every year.My MIL's iPad mini suffers the same fate with iOS9. It's unusable almost, with a slew of problems like sluggishness, crashing/freezing and unresponsive touch input. Makes me just not want to touch it at all.I still remember when I upgraded my iPhone 3G to iOS 4. It made it practically unusable. This feels like a repeat of that time.They are obviously looking for out of court, would be impossible to prove Apple did this knowingly unless they know what emails to subpoena and even then I dont think any engineer would discuss something like this.Try being me going from an iPhone 6 to iPhone 5s to iPhone 4. The iPhone 4 is the slowest piece of shit I barely even use it, let alone charge it. be cool if they let you trade it in for a new model I have a 4s with 9.2 on it and though I had to reset all settings after this update, I do not see a slow down like described in this post."
"I wonder if people actually try to resolve technical issues before trying to sue a company. "
"And I only saw a battery drain issue until I reset the phones settings and then set it back up. I don't care to defend apple, but I personally do not see a problem with my 4s with 9.xI DESPISE Apple with a passion!"
"This silly lawsuit won't fix anything"
"It will just make the lawyers richI think Apple is probably covered by the EULA these people skipped over when upgrading.The entire IDEA of an EULA a user agrees to before using the product is against MANY laws, and hasn't itself been tested in court before.Even if explicitly stated in the EULA that some company reserves some right to do something to your device, such things often do not stand in court. If I wrote an OS but my EULA said I reserve the right to all information on your computer, such a thing would not stand in court.I don't think Apple is the only one but I am glad it is starting there.well honestly when you compare the iPhone 6s to the iPhone 4s there is a great difference, the iPhone 4s only has 512 mb of RAM as opposed to the 2 GB's of RAM in the 6s. plus the 4s has a 5 year old processor, and ios 9 was obviously optimized for the 6s which can handle it very well... but the 4s just isn't powerful enoughThen why push updates for the phone? It's powerful enough to handle iOS 9... Just not well... I have an ipod 4th gen and it runs like shit... It used to be able to run games like Infinity BladeThey have been doing this since the first iphone. I remember this happening to my 3gs. They know what they are doing. This lawsuit is as dumb as a PC user suing Microsoft because Windows 10 doesn't run as well on their Pentium 4 as Windows XP did. I'm sorry, but the iPhone 4 and 4s were the last two old tech phones before ALL mobile CPUs (not just Apple's) processing power began scaling exponentially, rather than linearly. The iPhone 5 is also long in the tooth, though significantly less so than the iPhone 4s due to its old CPU architecture."
"Technology evolves, as do operating systems. Could Apple do better by maintaining a signed downgrade version of each previous iOS? Absolutely, but then we'd have the mishmash fragmentation and security holes of vendor-styled Android. What if someone finds a vulnerability in iOS8? Should Apple be obligated to patch it just because some folks are holding out on obsolete equipment? We're talking about a handset that is five years old, yet still receives modern OS updates. The only other phones I know getting the same treatment are some Galaxy or Nexus devices, but even then it's a scattershot of features, compatibility, and available versions."
"Yes, the mobile OS marketplace leaves a lot to be desired. Yes, Apple could do better at ensuring the speed of older devices over time. Then again, so could Android and Microsoft. Even so, this is a bullshit excuse for a lawsuit. The OS may not be as zippy, but it's at least up to date and doesn't hamper core functionality. If you really dislike it, then just stop upgrading willy-nilly, and consider this a hard lesson in how IT works."
"Ugh, some people just demand to be special little snowflakes. You bought a proprietary device five years ago with zero open sourcing, that is still supported by the manufacturer despite you having given them zero money since."
"Cry more, or hop to an open source device. Spoiler alert, even they're not supported forever.This statement doesn't make any sense. I have an iPhone 5, which is kinda dated but still a pretty recent phone, and it got a ton slower with the new iOS 9 update, it's insane. iOS 8 was super smooth and fast, then from one day to another *poof* it's slow as hell. That's unacceptable, especially since the 'features' that came with it aren't that special either. It's not like the iPhone 5 is antique..."
"Same thing happened to my old iPad 2, iOS 7 was incredibly smooth, then iOS 8 came along and turned my awesome iPad into a slow, sluggish, laggy device.Windows 10 doesn't prevent your computer from downgrading if you don't like it.  Microsoft is still releasing updates for Windows 7."
"Apple does not update iOS 8 for all devices and doesn't let you roll back to it."
"So this lawsuit is nothing like suing Microsoft for Windows 10."
"Yes Apple should be obligated to patch their software on old devices, if they choose to lock down what software can be installed.  If they want to unlock the hardware and let me run a third party os, it might be different.7?  Hell, Windows is still supplying security updates for Vista, and will do so until 2017.Purposely outdating hardware with software is a great way to sell new phonesHavent they been doing this for awhile? It took this long for people to catch on?iOS 9 on the 4S was worse than normal. It's been clear that they've been using iOS upgrades to encourage planned obsolescence for years, but this particular time was worse than in the past and hit a tipping point. This is the reason I won't let my family buy apple devices.  I will not support them.  "
"They lock updates so you can not downgrade.  To install a fresh OS on a device, iTunes needs to connect to the apple servers and request a signature for your device.  If apple isn't signing the version you want to install, too bad for you.  "
"Sure you can jailbreak and save your signatures for each version.  But you can also not do that and just buy from another vendor.  "
"Fuck apple.  My wife upgraded to a 6s for this exact reason.Umm... Assuming it was intentional isn't that the outcome they are looking for? Imagine if after 3-4 years, a car company put an update on your automobile's computer that made it slower, or perform worse.Actually several parts on automobiles are engineered to fail at some point (in order to prevent worse failures). example: Head gaskets eventually leaking/blowing so your engine block doesn't. Now if you don't fix it...There is not a single vehicle with head gaskets designed to fail.  Head gasket failure can destroy an engine.An optional upgrade that you agreed to.They lock you out of putting gas into your car because you didn't upgrade though.This an analogy to something Apple locks you out of because I can't think of what it is?How is apple doing that? Terrible analogy.App store doesn't work as well, YouTube and search engines slow down and crash more. Everything there is an update you lose a huge portion of your storage. Nobody is forcing you to update, though.I shouldn't have to skip on updates with a new phone model that is less than 2 years old because apple slowly forces people to buy new phones. Previous 5c owner.The 5c is 2 years and 3 months old and is commonly looked at as a 'low end' iPhone - not for power users.Just because your favourite app doesn't support lower iOS version than latest. That's on the app dev.Not really. Apple makes it really hard to develop for older versions of iOS since the simulator that ships with Xcode usually only supports 2 versions (I.e. The Xcode 7 series simulator can only run iOS 8 and 9.)"
"Also you can't run the iOS 7 simulator on El Capitan, no matter what version of Xcode you haveWhat? What has Apple kept straight up kept out of the hands of customers who don't immediately upgrade? That's like saying your phone won't charge without an upgrade that doesn't make any sense, man. Not sure if you know this but if your iPhone is eligible for one of these updates, it gives you a pop-up menu asking you to update every couple days. It's optional but Apple does everything they can to make you update except lock you out of your phone.Then you purchase a new car... But by a different company in hopes this one doesn't do the same thing as the last one.Comon man, don't give them any ideas.That's coming eventually.That would probably be sued to hell and back, since cars have a minimum expected life of 7-10 years, often more if maintained properly. What about my iPad 1 with 5.1? It's total shit!I'm pretty sure they can pay this lawsuit with the loose change you find under the cushions of any given couch on Apple headquarters They've done this to every phone for yearsI had an iphone 4 when they release IOs 8 and all of a sudden my device was so slow that hurted! Back in those days i felt that apple was screwing the users up! There is no reason to upgrade an Iphone if still works flawlessly! They new this because the Ipad where so good they lasted 4\5 years no reason to upgrade As someone who just *finally* upgraded to an iPhone 6S from an iPhone 4S, ***fuck iOS 9 on iPhone 4S.***"
"Fucking *atrocious*.My IPAD 2 works like shit now after an IOS upgrade around a year ago.. Battery life cut in half and opening and closing apps is incredibly slow..  Why provide me with an update that makes my IPAD not even worth using anymore?"
"I have never supported apple and thankfully got this device for free.  I did change my mind about hating them 100% to 90%, and was honestly going to continue to buy Ipad only products as I enjoyed it while the experience was good.  Now that they do this to their devices its time to get Surface Pro or Android Tablet that later on can always turn into a lightweight linux distro once support is gone for that device.Yeah, my 4S runs like garbage now and the battery life is a joke.  Never had any complaints about it until I needed to download a newer OS since apps wouldn't work with the older OS any longer.  I kind of feel like I was in a catch 22 where I had to choose between not being able to access multiple apps or get an updated OS.  Overall, I am no longer happy with how my device works now and I would at least like the option to revert to an older OS.Same here.  My gen 2 Ipad is slow as fuck just doing basic shit. And I'll be goddamned if I'll buy a new one seeing how the updates slow their shit down.Any chance this extends to the iPad 2?it extends to all apple products. With every update when I owned the Iphone 5c the phone was slower and slower. My Ipad gen 1 was unusable every time you tried to search google, play you tube or even search the apple store it would crash after 10 seconds. i have a 4S. there is no allegedly about it. the worst thing is... you cant go backwards.Just the 4s?  The past two times they've release a new model phone, my previous gen phone has been laden with problems and issue and obviously slower than it was prior."
"Throw stones at me if you must, but I still love apple.  I'm just saying there's been some shady stuff going on to the previous models for awhile now when their newest phones drop.I have an first generation iPad that used to work just fine."
"I started my own business and opened an account with bank of america.  When i tried to download the app, i got a message saying i had to upgrade my operating system."
"What a huge fucking mistake!"
"Ever since then, it freezes, crashes, reboots all by itself, and is generally a pain in the ass."
"And it never could play youtube videos from the website-it only plays them from the little box below a reddit entry.The iPad 1 came out 6 years ago. You can't seriously expect developers to keep underpowering their apps for a 6 year old device, it's a lifetime in the tech world."
"Well they might warn people that an ugrade will effectively destroy the error free performance of earlier models, which they don't do."
"If I saw a warning to that effect before I overwrote the original OS, I assure you I would have thought twice."
"The average car on the road is eleven and a half years old.  Not all that long ago, in the scheme of things, it was half that."
"I am 62- the concept of a sleek, six hundred dollar device being outdated in a couple of years does not square with my value system."
"Nor, I respectfully submit, should it.Who cares about how old the iPad is?  It worked before the update just fine for this guy and if he just didn't update there wouldn't have been a problem.  If he wanted the newest apps he could have chosen to buy a new device with hardware that can support it, not be forced into it because he accidentally updated. Like we do for browser support? Its not the app developers. I dont care how old the device is honestly, if there is a user base, apps/products will be developed."
"The only reason that doesnt happen in the iOS ecosystem is because apple doesnt want users continuing to use older devices, they want them to buy new devices.It's not a matter of performance really. Apple actively pushes developers to develop for the newer platforms via deprecation. And this has ALWAYS been the Apple way. Yup, their dev tools only let you compile for the latest two iOS versions.It goes a lot deeper as it's not just the 4s as iPad 1 and 2 suffer just as bad from iOS 9. I updated to iOS 9 because an app I used frequently required iOS 8 for an update. Since 8 is no longer available I had to go to 9. According to one of the developers of the app, nothing in the update required iOS 8 but in order for Apple to approve the update to be posted to the App Store, they were forced to flag it to have an iOS 8 requirement even though it would run just fine on iOS 5."
"There's no doubt in my mind this is intentional as there was a time when Apple restricted what version of iOS could be loaded on a device. At some point they realized this was costing them money and could slow down people's devices tricking them into thinking thier hardware was worn out.Oh, your iPad 1 doesn't take iOS 9 well? That's weird, considering the max is 5.1.1 on that one.Wonder how many upgraded to an Iphone 6 instead, probably more than $5m worth.A few years ago iOS 5 did the same thing to my iPhone 4. Makes sense to me that they do this on purpose so you'll upgrade, is that really worth a lawsuit?How has Apple violated any laws? If customers don't like it, switch to a different phone manufacturer. I think the problem is they tell people to update and make the device worse.  "
"If it was an update people had to go search for instead of being prompted, they probably wouldn't have a case.This definitely happened. I had iOS 6 up until a couple weeks ago and my phone worked fine.  I couldn't upgrade to 7 because it was too big.  I recently realized that iOS 9 was small so I did the upgrade and now my phone freezes all the time.A whole five! All phones succumb to this.."
"If they didnt I would still be using my Nexus SAndroids are way more resilient than Apple devices. My Note 1 was ridiculously slow but after a few months of tweaking it's good as new. Just gotta find alternatives and root as well as remove bloatware/unneeded processes and applications.This is nothing new, same thing happens with every gen of an older iphoneI have a 4s with iOS 9.2 and I haven't noticed any real difference.oh wow. 5 million.ITT: People thinking they have a law degreeIs the 4 and earlier just assumed dead now?The 4 didn't get iOS 8, so for all intents and purposes, it's dead.I think Samsung did a similar thing with their Lollipop version. Ever since I got the update, my Galaxy S4 has been buggy as shit. The wifi takes ages to turn on, for example. Should be 1000 times thatWhere will the $5 million go? To the owners of iPhone 4s?My iPad crashed while reading that article.5 million dollars? I think that's fuck you money for them. No biggie, right?This isn't new. As someone that had a 3G and, later, a 4, I always felt that after 2 generations things just didn't work as well. That's it?!I'm with you. Cynical, but with you.Except Google does the opposite? The latest version of Android has loads of optimization improvements that benefit newer and older phones. They still release updates for the Nexus 4 and it doesn't have the same issues like the 4S does with iOS 9. Nexus 4 officially gets security updates only now (even then still pretty good FWIW), you'd need to resort to a custom ROM based on Marshmallow to get it. Even then said ROMs apparently run quite well, and in memory management [it can take on many of today's flagships](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJa_4sj5To00).Oh no ... however will they afford this??$5 mill? Seems like a cheap way to give apple's junior lawyers some practiceReason why I never updated my phone. thats nothing for Apple, the attorneys will prolly make tons of money, and I will get a letter in the mail telling me I am eligible to get a check for $8.03 compensationIt's just so fucking incredible... Now we just need to hit them with a lawsuit for the original iPhone 4 power button crapped out constantly.  The only good thing about it was that my next phone wasn't from Apple.Why are they being sued for this *now*? They did the same thing to the iPhone 4 with the launch of iOS 7."
"I guess the difference is that they eventually fixed\* the problems with an OS update."
"\* - they didn't actually fix itI have an iphone 4 to this now. I cant even use fb messenger without wating for a minute. IOS8iPhone 4 did not support higher then 7.1.2I'm more surprised that people are only just realising Apple's terrible business practices."
"They've been doing this for years...This is standard apple protocol.  They've been gimping older devices with software updates since the beginning.  That's why you don't update an iPhone after two years into its lifecycle.  Never ever.  "
"My 4s was fine now my 3GS got slowed down to unimaginable speeds - where's my lawsuit? Show me the mooooneyFor you armchair lawyers out there, this isn't necessarily a $5 million lawsuit.  28 U.S.C. SS 1332(d) requires that for a federal district court to have jurisdiction over a class action, the amount in controversy must be at least $5 million, exclusive of interest and costs.  So that's what is pled in the complaint.  It's a minimum amount, not an estimation of actual damages.Google destroyed the nexus 4 and nothing came of it. Microsoft ruins computers all the time. I think it is just accepted as an inherent risk of accepting the update. Microsoft does, however, offer the option of rolling back. Apple currently doesn't provide for that, which is specifically identified in the court filing.Apple made $5m in the time it took you to read the headline.Sorry who is actually affected by this? Suing something for the sake of making money or what? This is definitely a problem only Apple will face. No one is going to complain that Android Marshmallow doesn't work on Android phones from 5 years ago.5 mil is not even pocket money for Apple.5 mil lolShitty apple, stop being a Jackass.Jokes aside I think $5 million is a lot more optimistic than anything more for some sort of reparations."
"We all know how stuck-up Apple can be when they're being sued, and so this seems like a way of actually winning.As someone with an iPhone 4, is there any way to support this? When I was working tech support for Apple, if a client started the call with the sentence I recently updated... you just knew that shit was fucked up. Reminds me of when everyones wifi would gray out right after one iOS update. People want an explanation, and you have to throw some mumbo jumbo out and hope they don't call you on it, cause you have no fucking clue why any of this is happening.Apple should just let users revert to a previous IOS version if newest causes issues for older phones.  Have a waiver that states they are not responsible for any issues this might cause. Can you speed up an iOS9ed 4S by jail breaking it and Cydia?Thanks for the warning! This is why I always wait at least 6 months before updating software.I had an iPhone 5 that worked perfectly until iOS 9. After updating it the device lost battery life. Each update made a small dent and then the last one caused my phone to run out of battery in 25 minutes without use and never turn on again.Spoiler Alert:"
"Apple products are defective by design.Spoiler Alert: Your 4+ year old mobile device will feel slower after the latest update which includes even more features & background services."
"How does KitKat, Lollipop, or Marshmallow run on a Samsung Galaxy S2? Oh wait it doesn't (without custom ROMs).Really? I like my iPhone 6s very much and it works just fine, thank you very much.My 4s runs dead slow and this was something I suspected Apple of doing as my Wife's 3 runs like lightning as she refuses to install the updates.  This has led me to want to upgrade, but to an Android phone instead as there is no reason for Google to do this.Go to Android man. You won't regret it.Android user here. This. You won't even get updates for that long so it won't be an issue. If the people cared how fast their phone was, they wouldn't be buying an iphone in the first place.iPhones are extremely fast out of the box. The Anti-Apple circlejerk needs to get its shit together. The A9 processor is fucking magical in the 6S. Even the A7 with iOS 9 on my iPhone 5 is completely usable. If not my word, there's always MKBHD. A well-known tech reviewer who clearly favors Google/Android, yet even he is able to admit the iPhone is one of the fastest phones on the market.it depends on what fast means in this instance. The A9 is a beast, but android as an OS feels much faster with faster animations and all 60fps. To me, Android feels faster, no matter how fast the iphone hardware is.So is the top of the line Android device, although you are right in criticising the user for using the speed argument. Top of the line any brand will zip along great on purchase.Good luck proving that planned obsolescence equals fraud.I hope they lose for the principle of the matter (seriously, Apple gets away with *far* too much shit), but 5 million is a joke.$5 million.. heh.  I bet they'll spend more defending it.  Can't let a precedent be set. So the class will get a $20 rebate on a new iPhone?Ooooooo"
"-AppleWell I guess my decision not to update past 8.5 was a good one. I have a 4s.  How do I get in on this action?I don't blame them.  I had a 4S and the recent iOS updates made the phone impossible to use.  I'd click on something and it would lag, take way too long to open and often would crash.  Messages would just disappear and it would take several restarts to get things back to normal.  The phone turned to complete shit to the point where I pretty much had to upgrade which cost me more because I have a grandfathered-in unlimited data plan and had to buy a refurbished iPhone 6.I'll say it again: iOS 6 was the last good iOS. Afterwards, QC is in freefall."
"Get Scott Forstall back and coax Bertrand Serlet into returning and Apple's golden again.but would that not make all apps look like cowgirl pants again ?I'll take Scott Forstall shitting out faux leather any day if it meant people got a relatively stable OS.My Nexus 7 from 2012 was reduced to function as an alarm clock because Android 5 sucked all the juice out of it. The iPad 3 from 2012 is still chugging along even with the latest updates. Yeah I know I can revert to older versions on Android but that's not really an average customer option. So it is not just an Apple issue."
"The best strategy for Apple customers is: buy a new device and sell it when it is 2-3 years old. The money you will get for an used Apple device is quite high and so you can invest in a new one. Everyone is complaining about the high prices of Apple devices but just compare the prices of an used Apple device to let's say an Samsung device; Samsung S4 vs IPhone 5S both from 2013. An used 5S is almost EUR100 more expensive. "
"The iPad 3 is absolute dogshit ever since iOS 8. It's almost unusable even with 9.2.I guess it depends on how you use it. My wife used it for Internet and a few low profile games. We sold it and she has an Air now but we did not feel it was slow. This doesn't just happen on iPhones, I just upgraded my Mac to El Capitan and it's pretty much unusable. "
"It took 10 minutes to empty the trash, it's even struggling as I type this!!"
"It just makes me not want to upgrade my mac but I fear that many do and the whole cycle repeats.Hey Apple Fans, skip this thread your in for a bad read."
"But that's just r/technology I call bullshit, old hardware can't handle new software as well, get over itDoes this mean i can sue Rockstar for selling me a game that makes my computer run slower than say someones I7 Skylake CPU computer?  "

"It's a phone that's a ~~little bit~~ lot slower This is what pushed me to get a Galaxy S6. "
"Best. Decision. Ever.Give it a year lmaoPlanned obsolescence isn't just an apple thing. If you look back to the Galaxy s3, you can't even get updates. They just drop support for your phoneNot really, my old S3 works just fine (I bought it used, now have an LG g3, but gave  my brother my S3 because there's nothing wrong with it).  7,000mah battery thrown in, can easily do 4-7 days per charge, which is longer than any smartphone you can buy that I'm aware of.What does a battery have to do with anything?Whether or not the phone can be powered on or used at all?  It's literally what powers the device.Apple should burn in hell.  The company is a scam.Tell the truth on Reddit and get down voted. Gave you an up vote for not giving a fuck.will it be a class action? my mums 4s is affected by thisIf you're really that hard-up for $3.50 in sweet, sweet class-action rewards, just PM me your PayPal and save yourself the heartache of waiting six months for the case to eventually get dismissed and no rewards being distributed.ahh is that all, im not american, i know little to nothing about suingYeah, class-action lawsuits like this are very lame. It's not a typical lawsuit where somebody takes somebody else to court. Instead, a group of lawyers takes the company to court. If they win, the company being sued provides large sum of money. MOST of that money will just go to the lawyers who worked the case. The remaining, small portion, goes to the actual victims of whatever they're suing for. And the way it's distributed is that the victims have to find out about the lawsuit somehow - usually the company who lost the suit will provide the lawyers a list of customers who bought the product in question, and send them a letter telling them they're eligible for a reward. Then after everybody enrolls into the rewards, the remaining money (after the lawyers take the majority of it) is distributed equally among everybody else. But because there's often hundreds of thousands of people in there, there's hardly any money given out to each individual person. More often than not, just a few bucks. "
"I've taken part in a couple class-action suits. Most of the time, I got less than $10. One time I actually got somewhere around $40, which was nice, but very rarely did the check come up to anything worth the gas it would take to drive to the bank and cash it.The last class action lawsuit I signed up for took 10 minutes and netted me $20 about six months down the line.This doesn't just apply to the 4S either. I have a 6S plus and it ran sluggishly up until iOS 9.2 was released. iOS 9 has just been a train wreck in general. It's a rushed and incomplete operating system that should have been much more heavily optimized prior to release.Sorry to be the one to burst your bubble on this, but every software upon launch has had some sort of release issue. It's nothing new, the main thing is that the engineering team at Apple actually listens to feedback and fixes things in a pretty quick fashion. Hence why the company has evolved the way it has. Not saying that iOS is perfect, because it definitely isn't, but i'd take it over any other smart phone software nowadays for its simplicity, elegance and easy of troubleshooting.People do realize it's a 5 year old phone right? The newest software is designed around the newest processors. The newer processors handle information better."
"How is this news. This is literallY part of every piece of software/OS ever designed."
"I swear. These comments are either from grandparents or tech idiots.iOS 9 is advertised as being an upgrade.  Clearly from your comments you either didn't understand or didn't read the article.[deleted]The lawsuit is because Apple includes no downgrade option. So anyone who upgrades is stuck with a slow ass phone.can you not backup, restore to factory and upgrade to ios 8?As a user of the iPhone 4S, I knew Apple would eventually pull shit like that. My 10 year old PC runs Windows 7 slowly. Should we sue Microsoft?Were you forced to update?Exactly my point."
"I didn't have to update. Having new software run slow on old systems is sort of expected. "
"You aren't forced to update to the new iOS. So people saying iOS 9 runs slow on their 4S...well, duh of course it will. It's slower hardware trying to run new software with all sorts of new features.Well, you aren't forced to, but you lose functionality until you do as apps refuse to work without updating.  That loss of functionality should not occur if they say they aren't going to require updates because, for certain apps, they most certainly do.But if I have app version 1.1 and it works great in iOS8...don't update the app then?Updates for apps are often seen as synonymous with greater functionality.  If I don't see any indication that the updated app would no longer work with my current iOS version (which I should before updating), then why wouldn't I update it?  I understand that things might not work the best on my older iPhone, but if it straight up isn't going to work with my iOS, then I should know that before updating it.I agree but I don't think that's Apple's issue if an app gets updated and loses functionality in the old iOS? That's all I'm saying."
"Basically if you don't update your apps (for a newer iOS) and use the iOS that comes with your phone, you shouldn't have any problems?Perhaps it isn't their issue, but somewhere along the line there should be warning about compatibility (if necessary) and the option roll back the iOS or app version if a user wants to.  Whether that responsibility falls on the shoulders of the app developers or Apple is of no consequence to me, the end user.  I just want to see one of them step up and do it to improve the experience.  I believe Apple should have an interest in doing so since people often attribute lost functionality with a device, not the programs used with the device (at least initially).I think that sounds like a really good idea - a class action lawsuit though doesn't make sense.Well, yeah, everyone does planned obsolescence; if every company that did this was also fined no one would want to have anything to do with smartphone manufacturing.>Well, yeah, everyone does planned obsolescence;..."
"But the lawsuit filing seems to go beyond that and is alleging ~~what borders on~~ sabotage for intentionally degrading performance with no option to roll back to a better performing, fully compatible OS in an attempt to coerce owners of their old iPhones to upgrade where they might not have felt the need to do so, otherwise. If what the plaintiffs allege is true, it would mean that instead of Apple incentivizing upgrades via the offering of more features and inherently superior performance, a more robust OS, Apple is essentially extorting its customers to upgrade by breaking their current iPhones. That's like Bridgestone hammering nails into your car's otherwise functional tires and saying that you need to upgrade to their newest tires. Based on what the lawsuit is alleging, if Apple was being honest, it would simply not have the option of upgrading to the newer OS for owners of their previous iPhones, or warning of the negative consequences for upgrading and/or allowing a rollback to the previous OS. I keep seeing this crap about planned obsolescence, but this is the exact same thing people deal with with older computers. "
"You have an old phone. To use newer software that taxes a system a lot more, you have to update the operating system to an OS that, in turn, will tax your system as well."
"These are the same fucking people that complain that they CAN'T update to the latest iOS version because their phone is too old; either way, Apple is somehow trying to force them to buy newer hardware. "
"Do me a favor -- go buy one of the cheaper and earlier Windows 7 computers, get the Windows 10 upgrade, and let me know how it runs for you."
"Jesus Christ, some of yall are worse than my grandparents, thinking their old tube TV should be able to play Blu-Ray movies.>These are the same fucking people that complain that they CAN'T update to the latest iOS version because their phone is too old; either way, Apple is somehow trying to force them to buy newer hardware."
"They haven't put iOS restrictions on devices for quite a while now which is why we have this problem. Much like every other aspect in life I'd be willing to bet it was a vocal minority that complained they couldn't upgrade their device to the latest version. When Apple prevented devices of a certain age from progressing further in the iOS version, they weren't bricking said devices. They were simply saying if you want access to the latest features you need the latest hardware. Now with no restrictions in place they are forcing you to upgrade because devices are being rendered unusable since once the update is applied there is no way to revert. They even go so far as to entice the user into upgrading when everytime you close an app, end a call, change a setting, etc...you are prompted with a notice informing you an upgrade is available and the process is just a couple of clicks from starting. "

"My mother has a very generic Asus from '10 and she accidentally went through the Win10 upgrade process and after I clean installed, it has 0 issues. I think this is great. I love when apple gets sued.thats why you jailbreak. Been runnin 7.1.1 since I got my iphone.Own a 4S is it was so damn slow from this."
"I broke ties and now Samsung Galaxy Note 4, couldn't be happier. (just a little big in the pocket)So your phone from 2011 was slow so you switched to a phone from 2014 and it's faster? Wow!

The real question should be why are people still using the 4 or the 4S?ITT people who think batteries don't deplete over time, and that much more advanced software shouldn't use more power."
"If your iPhone is over 3 years old, the battery will likely need to be replaced soon. Call AppleCare and ask to get a free diagnostic done on it.Apple makes $5 million in 0.00001 second. lol funny.. same people went on and on about how apple updates all its phones.. this is why samsung htc and others dont update all their phones.You realize that people who use cell phones expand outside of the western culture right? Many cell devices run just fine on older operating systems. This is an issue because of how ios ecosystem works. Everyone who uses the iphone can't necessarily own the newest device but may enjoy the operating system. If Apple is truly slowing down devices they are really only hurting themselves in developing countries which is where they were wanting to expand. This is why android continues to grow with such speed in that area. Apple just makes such bad decisions these days. This is not what Steve had in mind. It's never been the apple way to try to dominate the market share. They don't need to be winning on that front to maximize profit.The iPhone isn't a product targeting developing countries. The only phone that Apple sells is an expensive, high-end device.Just a few in here placing the monetary value of the lawsuit above the principle of it...I've been saying this for years with each damn upgrade.  They deliberately slow down the older phones to make people feel as if the new ones are more 'powerful' than they actually are.   iPhone 6+ 16gb user here. My phone is so slow I wanna kill myself and Louis C.K. would make fun of me.That's from only one update?  Does that mean ALL updates will slow the phone down?That's why I upgraded. I hope Apple loses.Was apple contractually obligated in any way to continue supporting and optimizing new software for old devices? Shit.. My phone 5 years ago was an HTC Aria. If I expected ATT/HTC to provide me updates at all, let alone ones that run well today, I'd be called a lunatic.I would expect essential security patches for 10 years.  They should be forced to do that by law.It's been slowing down phones since iOS 8, it was frustrating as hell to use my 4 with iOS 8. My girlfriend is now having this problem with iOS 9 on her iPhone 5. It's not just 9 on the 4's.Lol meanwhile Quentin Tarantino is being sued for $100 million dollars for allegedly stealing the idea for Django. Hey my iPhone 4 is terrible.

"My iPhone 3G got stuck on iOS 4, I could not upgrade it any further. The idea that you're going to update the 4S to iOS 9 is highly doubtful. It should actually tell you which system support which phone.What the fuck are you on about?unupdatable platforms.Next they'll be sued for using more memory in the device... or needing more power to fully charge, or more time to fully charge... or costing more... or having slow access at the App store on-line... or longer waits at the real Apple stores... or for NOT having features that someone else has...Nah that last one would've happened by now.

Sure Apple most definitely gave the NSA a backdoor into my phone, but no smartphone can be made truly anonymous. It's the update itself that I knew was trouble as soon as I heard about it.but you bought their phone to begin with?It was the best available option for what I wanted. When they talked about iOS9 making Siri smarter and proactive and integrating it into every aspect of your life, I knew it was a huge privacy risk.

"I also want to let people know that Apple has a [Security White Paper](https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf) which they update regularly, that describes *in detail* how they secure the data on your iOS device and in transit and in iCloud."
"The first part about iMessage:"
"-----------"
"iMessage makes extensive use of the Apple Push Notification service (APNs). Apple does not log messages or attachments, and their contents are protected by end-to-end encryption so no one but the sender and receiver can access them. Apple cannot decrypt the data.  "
"When a user turns on iMessage on a device, the device generates two pairs of keys for use with the service: an RSA 1280-bit key for encryption and an ECDSA 256-bit key on the NIST P-256 curve for signing. The private keys for both key pairs are saved in the device's keychain and the public keys are sent to Apple's directory service (IDS), where they are associated with the user's phone number or email address, along with the device's APNs address.  "
"As users enable additional devices for use with iMessage, their encryption and signing public keys, APNs addresses, and associated phone numbers are added to the directory service. Users can also add more email addresses, which will be verified by sending a confirmation link. Phone numbers are verified by the carrier network and SIM. Further, "
"all of the user's registered devices display an alert message when a new device, phone number, or email address is added."
"------------Hey. Apple turns over everything already. "
"No shit"
"http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/2o5jo4/udickwhiskey_destroys_a_clickbait_article_by/That actually discusses how iOS8 is designed to make complying with such orders an `unreasonable technical burden` for the company. They can't bypass lock screens, they can't decrypt messages on the fly. Their company has set up their infrastructure so that they are no longer the Fed's fallguy for breaking into user's data/communications. "
"That doesn't mean the Feds can't do it, it just means they can't claim that Apple has to do it for them in a context where the evidence can be introduced to a public prosecution.Do both parties need to have the app installed for security to take affect? That's how it usually works with these sorts of systems.> iMessage makes extensive use of the Apple Push Notification service (APNs). Apple does not log messages or attachments, and their contents are protected by end-to-end encryption so no one but the sender and receiver can access them. Apple cannot decrypt the data."
"Does it matter since phone companies already log all messages, and have backdoors?  Doesn't matter if it's secure in the middle if it's open season on both ends."
"You say et cetera, but I don't see it anywhere for Windows phone.Your positive comment falls apart at this part of the article unfortunately.  Making it a problem for both Apple and Signal."
">  The obvious flaw in this system is that the government could potentially force Apple to add an additional public key to your account, which would be analogous to registering an extra device, said cryptography expert Matthew Green in an email. Now everyone who sends you a message will be unknowingly encrypting an additional copy of the message to this new 'ghost device.' If the government runs that device, they can tap your messages."
">Simply put: Apple could be forced to allow the FBI to impersonate an iPhone user, which would in effect allow the agency to siphon off a suspect's messages as they come in."
">Green added that services like WhatsApp and Signal are also vulnerable to similar attacks.Signal has actually been designed to make it durable against the attack!"
"Every Signal user can see their key fingerprint and share it with others through another channel, and can verify the key fingerprint of other people when communication is established. This way, they can confirm that the key server didn't swap out keys, making it simply a distribution point and not a trusted exchange channel."
"With iMessage, there is no way for you, as an enduser, to get your key's fingerprint or the fingerprints of the other party's keys, to perform this kind of independent audit."
"This *does* mean you have to perform a little extra verification that isn't automatic."
"As for WhatsApp -- it apparently had some other weaknesses from rolling their own crypto, or something that made their implementation flawed. Don't know, briefly scanned over it, don't use it.Thanks for the reply, Still have to look into Signal, only times I have heard of it were in the comment and when I saw it mentioned in the article.> available for iOS, Android, etcetera"

"Moxie Marlinspike, who was quoted in that story about the public key directory vulnerability, is the lead developer of OpenWhisperSystems, and developed it to make the key signatures auditable and durable. With Signal, if you both have each other's key signatures, you can tell if the key server has swapped out keys. It means the key server is a distribution method that doesn't have to be trusted; it still leaves the problem of needing a way to exchange key signatures that you trust.Doesn't matter, firmware and hardware is compromised at the factory so any software after that is compromised, no matter how good it is."

"It's just in these somewhat fringe cases where the company got to say no."

"No they don't, it's just if they acquire data in an illegal manner it's inadmissible in court."
"What they do is build their case upon other supporting evidence that they do get legally based upon the information they get illegally."
"They always can use a straw man, a anonymous source that provides vital details if they can't do that."
"The problem is the jury hears the illegal evidence as the prosecutor gets to go first and the defense can object if they can prove the information was gained illegally and thus inadmissible, but that's difficult to prove. Even if proven, the jury still heard the illegal information despite being told by a judge to dismiss it."
"Trying to find cops who will testify against other cops is hard thing to do, they have a blue code to stick up each others testimony just like criminals do."
"Face it, our hardware is backdoored at the factory and anything in them is never going to be 100% private. Software on top of it isn't going to make a difference if the firmware is recording all the keystrokes.Admissibility is not determined in front of a jury, it is determined before the jury sees the evidence.

"At any rate, it doesn't matter that they can legally spy on US citizens without a warrant. My bigger worry is that, according to Snowden, the NSA isn't held accountable for producing warrants. If an NSA agent wants to snoop on a citizen they can. There are a lot of scary stories that have popped up involving stalkers and sharing stolen nude photos amongst government agents."
"Regardless of if the laws changed recently, the important thing is whether or not government agencies are held to those laws. Unfortunately I still don't think that's the case. Don't forget that they can always have their Five Eyes buddies snoop on us and then get their intel.[removed]> So how long until a Dictator rises and takes control of the three branches of government by force?"
"I'm not certain that that could happen in the US."
"Oh, don't get me wrong, I'm not naive. I understand that as we move toward a system where more and more voting districts use electronic voting machines owned by corporations known to be run by known corrupt individuals, we run the risk of popular vote becoming a meaningless term."
"Combined with that a President could certainly use the tremendous power of the US domestic spying apparatus (that we now openly admit that we have) to leverage Congress to some extent (I don't think you'd ever get the House to play ball, but the Senate you could undermine without too much difficulty)."
"So with the Senate backing a President, and assuming the military didn't eject him forcibly if he tried to use them to shut down the House, the SCOTUS becomes toothless and can be safely ignored."
"But here's where the problem arises. The US is a pretty huge place, and there are many states that will have none of it. Unless the guy who does it is from the South, most of the South will likely leave the union as soon as there really is a dictator and not some imagined they're coming to take my guns scare. The now-dictator could nuke the south and turn it into glass... but that doesn't solve the problem, and creates new ones (and I would expect it to lead to an immediate military coup, possibly before the nukes took flight). We could have another civil war, and the South would ultimately lose, but that would lead to an insurrection that would make Iraq look tame, and we know how well our government fares against insurrections."
"Meanwhile you have the economic situation. That's actually the one place a dictator might not fare too badly in the US, but it would be really hard to strike the right balance. If we descend into internal conflict, something very bad happens: our debt becomes less valuable. At which point, we can't effectively keep borrowing to prop up our massive debt load. We could refuse to repay our debt, but that doesn't end well, as China immediately becomes our economic enemy. No matter what, if our debt becomes junk, we're in for a whopper of a recession (probably a depression on par with the Great Depression) and economic pain always makes it harder for a dictator to maintain control."
"My point is that the US would be very hard to *maintain* a dictatorial control over (and that's partly by design). I think we'd need a real external threat to even make it work for a short while (this is how the Roman Republic fell, as you probably know) but turning that into a sustainable structure... I'm not sure it would be possible."
"When I point out these things I'm called conspiracy theorist."
"Thanks for posting the truth.I'd love to see the thousands upon thousands of terrorist attempts that they've stopped to justify all that has been violated and abused."

"You know what? I think I'd be ok with that :pThe amount of power that's been consolidated with no oversight whatsoever is insane and very scary> Secret courts, secret judges, exposing corruption is treason, unchecked surveillance, made up wars, flexing its arm to violate The Constitution..."
"I'm not well-versed in the US constitution, but aren't those the reasons why americans have a right to bear arms? The founders of the United States wanted no standing army so the government always had to do the will of the people or it would be overthrown, and when wars occurred wanted the population to join the war effort voluntarily. Due to circumstance (mainly Native American insurgencies) a small standing army was created. This didn't always work out as intended- the US Civil War had to rely on conscription from both sides, for example. Basically, the right to bear arms is in the US Constitution to form a voluntary militia when one was needed because the writers wanted no standing army."
"Proof of this:"
"Article II says this: A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the Right of the People to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed."
"And here's Article I Section 8, Clause 12 on not having a standing army (for long): The Congress shall have Power To ...raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years....Yeah but as a whole I'd like to think the US could find a better solution rather than say a modern-day civil war.Oh haha yes, I hope that as well, not saying they should start one.  "
"I allways thought they had the right to bear arms, to kind of scare their government into not being corrupt/doing dumb stuff like that out of fear for one.I currently live in Texas as a permanent resident so I'm allowed to purchase firearms. Honestly my little AR 15, pistol,  or shotgun won't do shit if our government comes rolling in with fucking tanks....True, I see your point.   "
"So, if I would say that it is more a tradition than a practical(?) right, would I be (very) wrong?I'd say it would be a very good topic for debate. On one hand yes I would say some of it is tradition. Most gun nuts I know are just pure hobbiests and love to blow shit up, plain and simple. On the other hand our right to bare arms was initially instilled in the constitution by the forefathers for the very purpose of having civilian protection from all enemy's foreign and domestic. "
"Edit: It just seems with all the corruption in our government we have alot of domestic enemy's. Shooting them won't be the answer, and I don't believe they are even remotely worried about that. A restructuring of how our democracy works would be a good step in the right direction. Maybe get rid of lobbying and corporations buying our nation's leaders. I can only hope our youth will one day be the saving grace of our debauched government. This is not designed for the bad guys, if something is extremely inefficient at doing its work but exposes the private data of all your citizens, then the target was not what they said it was. It's meant to fight dissent, to prevent occupy like protests.

"And we crucified the Nazis in Nuremberg for same crimes. Goebbels and Himmler would be laughing now."
"Seriously, I've been copy and pasting this quote all over the internet for the last 15 years. We joke about comparing things to Nazis online, but seriously."
"There was a psychologist interviewing many of the prisoners at Nuremberg. This is an excerpt of a conversation between that psychologist and Herman Goring, one of the leading Nazi party members. He founded the Gestapo before passing it over to Himmler and was a key player in the early part of the story as the Nazis seized power."
"> **Goring:** Why, of course, the people don't want war. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship.  "
"> **Gilbert:** There is one difference. In a democracy, the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives, and in the United States only Congress can declare wars.  "
"> **Goring:** Oh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.that is a brilliant quote. Do you have a Link to a complete interview?A [snopes link](http://www.snopes.com/quotes/goering.asp) that references *Nuremberg Diary*. Best *I* could find on short notice."
"> So how long until a Dictator rises and takes control of the three branches of government by force?"
"Ironically, when this happens, it won't be the sinister forces of the establishment that do this. They're already in control; why would they rock the boat?"
"No, it'll be a charismatic demagogue who's doing it to protect us from Them.It's stunning that every alarm isn't going off for every American when they read secret courts. The government is effectively asking for the right to violate the constitution and spy on every American in a court case that no American can ever see the details of. That is so distinctly un-American. They're literally could not be anything more un-American.Not to mention the secret courts have essentially Supreme Court level power. Yes the Supreme Court can override their decisions, but often they don't even know about the rulings. The president can do the same thing with executive orders, and has, creating organizations like [FEMA](http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/hardtruth/fema_executive_orders.htm), which may even have unconstitutional emergency power to declare martial law if congress is unable.This is how fascism starts. Blind patriotism, fear of outsiders, secret armed police, surveillance.It *started* a long time ago (pre-9/11, but 9/11 put it into hyperdrive).  The only question now is where does it end?"
"When we decide to stop remembering 9/11 as a positive experience.I'm a bit confused by your statement. Never have a met a person who think that the attacks on 9/11 were a positive experience.  We still have people dying to this day because of the events that occurred - be they soldiers who are overseas in a hostile environment in the related war(s), people who were exposed to massive levels of dangerous carcinogens like asbestos from the site of the building collapse, or citizens of other countries being killed by the fighting and ongoing terror.  Hardly positive for anyone involved in my opinion. It gave those wanting to legitimize the mass surveillance an excuse. As long as it is presented as a pivotal and life altering event, these stupidities will continue.Wasn't America supposed to be against the secret police? I wonder what country will have to save the world from the U.S?[deleted]Kinda wants this to happen, just because it will be great for the history books.[removed]The tools are great and they aren't even meant to be used against the government specifically but for hackers, but apparently goverment doesnt understand that if you build a backdoor for them then someone else will eventually make their way in also. See: TSA master key.Or the fact that if you do use encryption tools, you are now considered 'up to no good' and watched by the government.Using linux and going on linux forums is enough to get you flagged apparently."
"I'm fucked as an IT guy for a company that's concerned about its secrets. I look at all sorts of stuff like that.Then get everyone flagged. If everyone is flagged then the flag is meaningless.Eh, I have always suspected its some sort of pruning mechanism."
"First you have everyone, and you sift your way down. First you elimnate everyone who doesn't have the most common flag, then you whittle your way down until you start getting to the real specifics."
"Is this person tagged for talking to that person? Did they look at this data? Do they have these common contacts? etc etc etc."
"Its a filter, but still disconcerting to think that its possible to get yourself down a layer simply by researching common material.[deleted]> Secret courts, secret judges, exposing corruption is treason, unchecked surveillance, made up wars"
"Pretty much a standard description of the USSR during the cold war / red scare.I wonder if other countries will call this period the red white and blue scarethose colors aren't really associated with the USA anywhere but in the USA, especially not in the multitude of countries with the same flag colors.YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH YOU COMMIE BASTARDThe Chilean ScareThe French Scare The Paraguayan Scare.They would if they were conducting witch hunts and accusing anyone who didn't fall in line of being an American, red scare refers to American anti communist hysteria and not anything the Russians were doing. So kind of the same way this terrorism thing has been building up huh?In America yes. Indeed, calling this period in American history the terrorist scare wouldn't be out of place at all. Although who knows how seriously the government is in being scared of terrorists. Or are they following Winston Churchill's advice: never waste a good crisis?We're fighting them there so we don't have to fight them here! As if a rag tag group of terrorists could come in on a raft and take on the Coast guard, State and Local Police, National Guard, Armed Citizens ect. and then overthrow the government and institute Sharia Law. "
"Haha, yet there are probably plenty of patriots (opportunitists) who still spout this nonsense. "
"It's brought up almost every time I try to have a conversation with someone about ending the constant occupation of other countries and shutting down over seas bases.Perhaps the truth is somewhere in the middle. You really think branding journalist who expose corruption as 'political dissidents,' using the guise of 'terrorism' to allow unfettered and systemic removal of constitutional rights, along with zero accountability for the federal organizations committing these acts, and making everything a 'national security secret' lands somewhere 'in the middle?' "
"It's a scary place to be. It's a scary place to live. I'm scared of even typing these words because I don't want to be called anti-American or a terrorist because I believe the things being done in this country are questionable. Apple may have power and might, and more of the **public** on its side than any party in politics ever will, but **the government** has the power to bring that all crashing down by levying unreasonable and far-reaching financial sanctions."
"Um, the government is supposed to be, by the people, for the people, and of the people. Not the government and then also the people."
"This is adorable. >crashing down by levying unreasonable and far-reaching financial sanctions"
"The problem with this kind of tough talk is that it signals to Apple to further diversify their talent/offices offshore; even before a single fine/sanction is levied."
"Apple are already used to this line of thinking with their production facilities, and have R&D facilities in a growing number of countries (e.g. Israel and Japan.) They regularly raise bond-based capital in foreign countries so they can continue their offshore diversifications. (Just recently the UK and a few months prior in Australia.)"
"There is also a very real short term issue of sanctioning Apple: It will most harm the USA and harm investors who trade in Apple. (i.e. everyone in the USA with superannuation.) In the same vein that large banks are too big to fail, the largest public company in the world is too large to sanction. It's suicide.Aah yes, the good old government should do what majority wants argument. People like to vote for parties with the lowest taxes and most welfare, unfortunately they are mutually exclusive. Often government just has to be decisive.> but the government has the power to bring that all crashing down by levying unreasonable and far-reaching financial sanctions."
"That only works as long as you within US soil, just saying...Uhhh, where have you been for the last 100 years?I wonder how Trump feels about thisNaturally, in this present time, it takes a corporation stepping in the way of a government being tyrannical before the government would dare step on the toes of a corporation.And then people wonder why companies move overseas.  We are doing some of this to ourselves....And this is why companies shouldn't be based in any USian state. Be it the US, UK, Germany, etc.So in other words, Apple needs to start a defense division?"
"Bringing Apple down could destabilize the American economy. It is one of the largest companies in America. (#12 in the world after oil companies and banks)"
"A government large enough to give you everything you want is large enough to take everything you have.To be fair, by the people the men who originally made that statement were referring only to wealthy, white, land-owning men such as themselves.Well duh, blacks weren't *people*.  /sI think they may have been a bit divorced from that idea, as they had only recently acquired land and a sense of ownership of that land at the time of the writing of the Declaration of Independence and the gradual rebellion from British rule. This was a document meant to inspire, to relate to, to unify not just the wealthy but also the common folk. The war for independence could not be fought if it was meant only for the wealthy; how then would the American rich be that much different from the British, the Crown? So what? We've done hard work as a nation in the past couple hundred years to redefine and then redefine again what the people means.though you're probably just being facetious, i really recommend you read the writings of the founders. they're surprisingly still relevant and easily understandable. in my opinion, they made pretty clear that they definitely did not mean that.So far, nothing has gotten me this riled up about the US's government. The fact that the government basically has to blackmail companies so that they have complete access to our social lives is absolutely disgusting. The US Constitution states that we all deserve a right to privacy, and yet a company that tries to protect that right is then persecuted by the government. This is just wrong in so many different ways. I'm just left wordless and hope that we come to a conclusion that is right. Last time I checked, the government is comprised of people.  There are many good career actors in government who must be weak to stay there and are easily controlled by the few psychopaths in charge."
"The goal is not to change government but to find a better system to weed out the psychopaths -- perhaps through some blood tests or frontal lobe exams.> Today the people have destroyed all trust that the government had in them; only through doubled workload can this trust be gained back"
"A quote from a soviet republic in 1953, but it very well fits into our society today."
"Shows what ideals are worth.Well, the public doesn't care enough. Most voters won't vote to minimize this, nor do they have a choice really with bipartizan support for this in the US.And therein lies the problem with our modern government.This goes far beyond modern government.Don't the people overthrow the government for this kind of shit?That's impossible at this point.We can overthrow the government at the polls every few years.  We just don't.No, it isn't."
"It just requires the right kind of leadership."
"That leadership will not be found with any political party or related organization, PAC, etc."
"It has to be grassroots, and politicians must be kept away from it.It still is. Just make a famine. Wrong. It could be done using state's rights. Many states have direct democracy. We could e.g. (in the extreme example) write a bill that says that the California Republic will become independent on January 1, 2018 unless the federal government stops violating the 1st and 4th amendments. I don't think so. Maybe in 10 to 20 years it will be impossible when nanotech becomes developed and the government could just terminate entire swaths of the population instantly. That's why we have to do it now before it's too late.It takes a few military officers who lead a few thousand soldiers to get the dominoes falling, along with popular support. Yea it can be done.Bullshit! Do you know how many American citizens own guns? How about the prospect of convincing military personel to fire on its own people if civilians ever decided to stand up? I really believe it's possible but we've been tied to shackles of debt, thus giving people no time to do anything about it.Why do you think so?Civilians can't possibly win a war against the most over powered military in the history of the world.   What will Billy Bob's  shotgun  do against an A-10 or an Abrams? Found the guy that never did war games during the summer."
"Military would last 6 weeks, tops. This kind of statement arises frequently in discussions like this.  You have to provide logistics for both of those things to work effectively.  An Abrams/A-10 won't operate too long without massive logistical support.  That logistical behemoth required by the military crumbles when dissent occurs."
"The government stock piles a lot of fuel and ammunition, but it has to have people willing to continue to do so, have supply lines uninterrupted, etc.. "
"Because they're planning for it.  All the laws passed post 9-11 are adaptable to domestic uprisings. Plus the largest military known to mad.  "
"They can shutdown an entire city by turning off the power, cell phones, and gas (they stop the gas stations during hurricanes routinely).   They'll also stop the food from entering any rebellious city if they feel like it."
"They have the power, that's all there is to it.The military is made up of people. If a movement got going, even with only a few million people, they'd back down. "
"Hell, this sub has 5 million ish people. If all 5 million of us were US citizens, and began a (peaceful) protest, a lot of shit would happen. Sure, they may try and disperse people. But according to wikipedia, the Us army is made of around 1.5 million people. Outnumber the military, and they will definitely back down. "
"Now, if all 5 million began revolting, then shit will hit the fan. Remember what happened to the General in Thailand that led the revolt?"
"Can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs. "
"Seriously though, with people able to actually voice their opinions over social media, it wouldn't be impossible to see an uprising succeeding. Even more so when you factor in the fact the military is volenteer in, people may refuse to shoot if it came to that. Even the US isn't that corrupt, yet. If the government goes so far afield that revolution is a serious concern, do you really think all of the members of the military, all of the lower tier government workers are going to keep doing what they've been doing? Do you really think that members of the US military are going to start invading their own country and killing citizens? Yes, the US has a VAST military dominance, but it's not just a bunch of mindless robots. They're all Americans too.There's enough police, Army, Marines willing to keep their jobs to overcome any city in revolt.  Keep in mind, without food, gas and electricity the people's will to fight will wane."
"The entire nation would need to rise up as one, but without the Internet, gas, food, etc, it'll be impossible."
"Americans barely won a war against a king 2,000 miles away.  But now the king is here, and owns everything. What are you going to fight a tank with???Tanks are easy when you have better resources than Afghanis have access to.> They're all Americans too."
"But they are the good Americans, and they will be attacking the villainous, murdering, traitorous un-Americans!"
"Happens all the time. Until they get a few million causalities in and then start to have doubts.Peaceful political revolution is still possible."
"Vote for Bernie Sanders, vote against our current Congress in your local elections.Not with that attitude.They said the same thing about the Roman Empire. That's interesting and relevant.  America will fall exactly (well, pretty spot on) as the Roman empire did.  In Rome, the people were given free bread and entertainment in return for voting the leaders into power. (As you probably know).  This is what lead to their collapse."
"But if you attempt to intervene with that process while the house of cards is still functioning, you will simply lose.  You can't beat it while it's working, and you can't stop it from failing. Isn't that ironic, don't you think?While popular, this version of the Roman fall has little to do with the actual problems the state faced that led to it's collapse. While corruption and political instability played a part, by themselves it wasn't enough to end the Empire. The rise of economies along the border and beyond, the cross training of barbarian warriors, the splitting of the empire, the Huns, over expansion, and the fall of the Roman Legion all played their part. It is one of the most contested and debated events in history.also the damage to the roman economy resulting from devaluing the currency by creating more monies to pay the large standing armyYou're right. It has to be considerably worse where nearly everyone's lives are miserable and to the breaking point of stress until the whole country will do anything to help each other. But they stop juuuust before that point.You gave away their secret, you're on a list now.Naww. It's been well documented, it's called 'Laffer's curve' since Laffer first discovered it. But... it is no laffing matter.So how much does the government value our privacy? what's the price tag on that fine?250k/day, doubling every month. It's what yahoo faced before buckling over. Man, the US needs a revolution. I say that only partly in jest. It'll never happen. People won't organize. There's too many distractions in this day and age. And those that do manage to organize will be pacified with free candy crush lives, celebrity nudes, etc."
"Finally the 0.001% that remain will be branded as terrorists and we all know 'Muricah feels about those.But this is literally how the roman empire fell.The Roman Empire didn't have 1/100000000th the military strength that the American government has. "
"A revolution without getting at least a relatively large portion of the military branches onboard would be crushed like a big within days.Except their standard of living was *way* lower. I wouldn't welcome a revolution right now. In principle, it *might* be better for future generations, but it would make my life suck. It would make all of our lives suck, and we probably wouldn't recover for generations, if ever. Maybe the first generation of organized government would be better because it's made of people dedicated to certain principles, but after we regained complacency, it would revert back to something similar to what we have now. At the end of the day, the government is always going to be made up of a bunch of people, and we're not going to change people."
"Instead, changes within our current government would be faster, smoother, and better long term. The people can't really do much (sadly), but big tech business could definitely come together. The tech industry might be the most likely to do it too. If they all threatened to move off shore to escape these fines, the government would *have* to comply.Apple should pass the fines onto its consumers and call it the NSA dick pics tax on its receipts.  Companies need to get creative in showing that they care for us.Apple products even more expensive!?they are usually comparable to products in their segment (high end tablet/smartphones, ultrabooks and high end all in ones, and whatever segment the Mac pro falls into). You pay for a device that isn't funded with ad revenue and has amazing support inside of an actual store.Except, you get none of that support outside the US."
"EDIT: Seriously. The next Apple store for me is 2 hours away by car, I don't have a car as I live in a large city, so I'd need to pay 40EUR for long-distance rail there and back, an I'd spend a whole day on that."
"The only realistic support I can get from Apple is going to a licensed 3rd-party repair shop, of which there are equally many licensed for Apple, SAMSUNG, LG, etc.I don't know which outside the US you're in, but I've only ever once had to take an Apple product to be repaired. It was in Vietnam, where there are no (or at least, were at the time no) actual Apple stores. There are, however, Apple authorised (3rd party) retailers and authorised repair shops. I took it to one of those, and my computer was repaired free of charge under Apple Care."
"Actual Apple stores may be difficult to come by (existing in only 16 countries, according to my Googling), but Apple authorised places certainly are not.Yes, but there are just as many (if not more) authorised repair shops for SAMSUNG, LG, ASUS, etc."
"And for a 200$ markup compared to competitors of the same hardware, Apple has to provide faaar better support than competitors."
"Which it doesn't."
"One of the reasons why Apple's market share outside of the US is very low."
"In Germany it's hovering between 15.3% and 17.4% (according to Forbes),  "
"while in the US it's between 47.7% and 39.3%$200 markup? Samsung's flagships cost just as much as Apple's."
"Same hardware? I didn't realize that Apple now sell's its custom SoC to other smartphone manufacturers. Example? No Apple Stores in most places? So nowhere to get direct support? And everything you get from Apple here is the support that's mandated by law, which is 2 years of replacing everything that was damaged through a manufacturers error."

"You see how the support grid is far worse outside the US?How many iPhone users are there in those countries? If you compare the ratio of iPhone users to the number of stores in each country, you'll probably get a conclusion.In Germany, it's 15% of the market, in the US more like 47%."
"But obviously, if you make a product that is only more attractive than competitors because of good support, but then only provide the support, or Apple Pay, or so on in the US, obviously it won't fly internationally.Apple is the only OEM retailer with that many stores thoughAnd? Does that number most stores help me at all when the next store is 2h away by car, and I don't have a car? I'd have to take long-distance rail to get to the next Apple Store."
"For me, and many people outside of the US, Apple might have more stores, but the support we get is not better than from any competitors.apple is likely the only OEM with a sizeable amount of detail stores.It mostly has those stores in the US, though."
"In the rest of the world, Apple - like every other manufacturer - has licensed 3rd party retailers and is sold in normal stores."
"And AppleCare is even the legally mandatory minimum that every manufacturer has to provide in Germany for 2 years - so it's not better than competitors in that regard either."
"But, even though the support here is the same as the support competitors provide, Apple has the same price as in the US.Can you find an OEM retailer with that kind of coverage then?Yes, many. SAMSUNG has just as many licensed repair shops here."
"And for laptops and computers, FUJITSU is unbeatable."
"I had an issue with my computer because the audio port stopped working, I called, 30 minutes later they were standing in front of my door with a letter, I gave them the PC, and they came back 2 hours later, had replaced the mainboard with a new one.Weird. What was that place with the Apple logo on it that replaced my MacBook Air a few months ago? In Berlin, Germany?"
"Also - what was the company that had my busted iPhone picked up by courier and replaced within four days, in Germany?"
"Who is doing this for Apple? And why isn't Apple doing it? This is so weird...I live in Germany, in a large city, the next Apple Store for me is 2 hours away by car."
"And I don't have a car. So I'd need to take the ICE long-distance rail, probably to Hamburg or Berlin. Spend a whole day and 40EUR just to get there and back."

"Apple has more stores in the US than in the rest of the world."
"In the US, every Apple store serves 1.2 million people. In the rest of the World, every store serves on average between 5.7 million (Germany) to 52.6 million (China) and 101.2 million (Brazil)"
"Which shows that the support network of Apple is far thinner.Then take it to a certified repair center. Unlike Apple, none of your other devices even have an Apple Store-esque optionBut, that's my argument: Apple does not provide me with an Apple Store-esque option either."
"The next Apple Store is 100km away, so for me, Apple Stores effectively do not exists. Still the price for an Apple product contains the cost of these stores."
"I literally pay for something I can never use.They should take a slight hit in the cost, since their shit is WAAAAY overpriced anyway.  That way the could charge the fee while still keeping the phones at the same cost.They don't care about you.  They are economic entities and incapable of emotion.   Unless there's profit involved, they will not do anything for you.  Anything else will result in shareholders selling shares.The Unconstitutional domestic surveillance by the US government tax.This is the Netflix approach. When Comcast was treating them like ass, they just bitched about it to their customers. It was pretty effective.My security is worth a tax like this. I'd happily pay it. Hmm, I would not.No one should pay to be allowed their presumed privacy.Well unfortunately no security is free so you pay for it in one form or another whether you're protecting yourself from the government or some hacker in China. I agree. It's noble for people on here to be ready to pay the tax, but the fact that it would even need to get to that point shows how sad the state of affairs is here in the U.S.  Gone are the days that the government at least *pretended* it wanted to protect us. Now it's gotten so jaded that they're basically saying *We have power, you don't. We set the rules, and if you don't comply - FUCK YOU!*Yeah things were so much better when the government pretended to care but still did whatever they wanted to anyway. This isn't anything new. Companies only care about themselves. That's how business works. "
"When companies are really good at caring about themselves, the benefits are seen by the consumers.I will gladly pay itDid you not read the part in the article that said the fines would equal the entire U.S. National debt by month 5?"
"The options are shut down, or comply. I think they should shut down if it comes to that. I simply can't understand why a company would comply with such a completely ridiculous threat. Firstly I would make that shit public in a heartbeat. Yahoo would have been in a position where they could have let all of their customers know about that. Second, even if the goverment would write yahoo's debt into oblivion, then the public would get to know about it. Maybe I'm too naive, but I can't understand, that threats as ridiculous as this can work. I bet some yahoo employees had to fear for their lifes if they didn't comply with the goverments intentions.gag orders and the fact that their engineers have families to feed... and the government knows it.You cannot gag order a fine, though, right? These are publicly traded companies, they have reporting requirements to comply with. They can't just let $250,000 magically disappear from their records.Seeing as how they would have to pay a ton of money anyway if they didn't give up the data they could just give all of their employees the money and close down.The government has a monopoly on force. That's the point of the government. If Yahoo did not comply with the fines, the government has the power to empty their bank accounts, repossess their assets, etc."
"Of course, if they actually did that, publicly, it would be a hell of  a shitshow. Companies would immediately begin exiting the country and pulling out assets from American banks."
"It could start another depression. I mean a real 1929 style depression. One that would make the 2008 one look like a minor dip in sales figures.The fines proposed would be to enforce the court order. In Yahoo's case, they were cumulative and doubled every month."
"From the article: "
">By month five, Yahoo would have faced fines upwards of the entire U.S. national debt, and then some."
"These are not something you can pass along.  At some point, the amount will go high enough that a buffer overflow will occur and Apple will be owed a lot of money.> Apple should pass the fines onto its consumers and call it the NSA dick pics tax on its receipts."
"Yeah this could end up being a bit of a culture shift: Companies may realize that consumers will actually pay MORE if they know that their data will not be just handed over and they will pay fines if the government levies them.I would actually do this, assuming that it's proven that they actually don't hand data over.I'm just too cynical to believe there ever is a way to prove that a company does not hand over data.open source FTW!What's interesting then is how many complaints were thrown, right here on reddit, when Apple announced the new iCloud storage sizes and costs.  While I agree with you completely, I still bet that the average consumer doesn't know or care.  It's absolutely amazing how many people don't understand this problem nor do they understand that they should be fighting for the right to encrypt.It's also interesting since John Oliver showed that dick-pics is a point where the average joe is really against surveillance. I know you say this in jest, but maybe it's not a terrible idea. It would suck for us, sure, but I bet it would draw some awareness to the issue.I wouldn't even be mad really. We are already paying, we just don't know now. It should also include all the losses caused when people abandoned American tech firms due to the revaluations. plenty of bars do it in areas where there are absurdly high alcohol taxes. makes sense. This one bar near my house has the two sales taxes listed as Harper's cut and wynnes cut (Ontario, Canada)My problem with this is technological, and it's an almost invisible slippery slope that the UK has already gone down..."
"Apple isn't refusing give the US government data that it has. What they're saying is that they don't have the data. The data the Government wants is encrypted on one phone, sent through Apple's servers and decrypted on the target phone. Apple has no more access to this data than a malicious third party."
"What the government is saying is that creating a truly secure communications mechanism is, in effect, illegal. *This is very dangerous*. It makes US-developed technology immediately second-rate and puts our major technology industries in a very difficult position in the global market."
"For example, Samsung could claim that they can no longer trust Google to make their OS, fork Android and re-implement their own social stack (gmail, hangouts, etc.) and the public might actually rally behind that."
"The US government is effectively destroying the currency of freedom in the global marketplace. Bravo."
"B b b b b but bad guys! This shit really needs to stop. Why haven't the courts ruled this sort of behavior unconstitutional?  Because they don't care about the constitution.Which courts? The secret ones?Government needs to impose sanctions on Apple so Apple can take the case to the supreme court and end the issue of overbroad surveillance once and for all.The same people that staff the spying agencies staff the courts.Do we assume Google and MS have already provided backdoor access?google uses your data and my data to make moneyGive [this](https://wikileaks.org/google-is-not-what-it-seems/) a read if you want to get bummed out about Google.Yes, sadly. Basically google makes money from using your data for better ads, complying is easy and they can't prevent compliance without screwing up their business model. Apple makes money from selling phones and computers, they don't care about your data and it's easy for them to comply (and is kind of an advantage over Google). Microsoft is in the middle, but I hope they shift to making money off software and not needing data.They're actually exactly shifting to making money off data and not software. This is why we now have free Windows 10 upgrades.Judging by the Windows 10 nonsense I don't have much hope. >Microsoft is in the middle, but I hope they shift to making money off software and not needing data."
"Have you seen Windows 10? It looks like they've made their decision.It's stuff like this that makes me realize that the companies are smart for moving over seas. They don't have to deal with the government trying to fine them for not letting them into their products. yes but Nabisco didnt move Oreo manufacturing out of America because of encryption policyOther countries are just as bad about it.Some other countries, but there are also dozens of much better countries when it comes to data security.That's why you have a choice of where to move. If you're a tech company, Somalia isn't really an option."
"Really, the countries you'd really think about moving to are usually just as bad.A research tech company would do at least some research and see which countries are suitable or not. Apple could literally go move to Togo and lay down infrastructure for themselves while propelling Togo into the 21st century with the money they would have been fined with by the US. Or Brazil or Kazakhstan or whatever. They'll research extensively. Chance of any of that happening: 0%."
"The world's best engineers and programmers aren't going to want to move to the middle of nowhere to live in Apple's company town in Kazakhstan.Just make your own country, just for server farms. Like [sea land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Sealand).> the companies are smart for moving over seas"
"Well, not EU. EU is terrible tooThis is something that is not exclusive to the U.S government.Companies move overseas to avoid taxes and regulation.That's not really true, well about tax. Taxes are paid on profits, which are issued as dividends. As they are American stocks the dividend is paid in America and you can't hide profit. What they do is avoid moving money into America from subsidiaries that have already paid tax located outside of America. This delays taxation, but doesn't avoid it.So the net result is a financial advantage having money overseas. That's what I'm referring to...An advantage by not brining money in straight away, it will still be taxed one day. Plus no big U.S company is moving taxable profit from the U.S to overseas to avoid taxation. That would be silly. "
">Companies move overseas"
"This is why I said you where wrong, the money is from European/Asian and South American profits. They are just holding them until they can figure out what to do with them. They aren't proactively moving overseas  like you suggested.Here kid, read this: http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/u-s-companies-are-stashing-2-1-trillion-overseas-to-avoid-taxesI read it all. They are keeping vast profits from subsidiaries outside the U.S, in those subsidiaries. Not paying them to the parent corporation to then pay out as dividends and be subject to corporation tax. However the only real way for them to issue that profit is to pay dividends, making it impossible to avoid American corporation tax. They money is stashed, not being taken as profit by the owners before paying tax. There is a difference. Plus my main point was they weren't moving operations overseas to avoid tax.You're missing my point. That is still their money. Read the article again. You can reword all you'd like. My original comment is valid.>You're missing my point. "
"Which is?"
">My original comment is valid."
"Except it isn't really."
"You have downvoted my comments and aimed snide remarks like kid at me. It's a very school boy attempt at winning an argument, where winning is more important than engaging in discussion and understanding different view points. Which this last complete dismissal of me is more evidence of in my eyes. I would suggest you either grow up or become more open minded in future discussions. It will genuinely benefit you, even in situations where your argument is correct.They ARE proactively keeping cash offshores. Not moving overseas though which was the original comment.Except a federal ruling recently said Microsoft has to hand over Irish server data. There's no point leaving.It hasn't actually been ruled on yet has it? I thought it was just in court. They won initially and it's currently being appealed. Heres an article from 2014 about [it.](http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-files-fresh-appeal-against-handing-over-email-in-irish-datacentre)Which they refused to comply with, multiple times in fact, and are in the process of appealing it.Of course they refuse. They have to.Irish government has made crystal clear to Microsoft, that if they release any data from Irish server without Irish court court order they are in deep trouble.I'm pretty sure that would be a violation of EU law to do so, so they would be in deep shit in any case. Hand it over and be in shit with the EU, or don't hand it over and be in shit with the US. Except that was very difficult and hasn't actually succeeded in getting the data yetPresumably because Microsoft is HQ'd in the US.Doesn't have to be HQ, if you have any US operations they can just go after those staff. Not necessarily, if the h.q. is foreign but they have a server in the U.S., that U.S. Server may be accessible but they wouldn't be able to use that to get information from other foreign servers. I believe the gov main argument is that the HQ is based I the U.S. and they can readily access and retrieve the data from the foreign server. "
"The problem is that the courts are extremely far behind in their understanding of the Internet and technology in general. By granting the governments subpoena/warrant the court would basically be allowing our government to legally access the information of anyone who uses the foreign servers, including foreign citizens. This could lead to a huge backlash from foreign governments against American tech companies. "
"If the court denies the order, then criminals can use foreign servers to shield their activities from the U.S. Government . While that might seem like an important issue its really a bit of a red herring because their are mechanisms for the U.S. Government to make this request for information through the foreign governments, but it's a pain in the ass for them."
"I think the order should be denied and the government should work with their foreign counterparts to figure out a system to get the information they need without violating the rights of foreign citizens or crippling the tech industry and basically forcing them to spy on their users for the government. > I think the order should be denied and the government should work with their foreign counterparts"
"Can't see that working in the long run. Just as there are tax havens nowdays, there will just form information havens in the future.The logic is similar to a scenario where an American fugitive crosses into Mexico and then saying, well he's American we have the right to go after him. An American citizen conducting emails through Ireland is similar. Similar how you would get the Mexican police to chase a fugitive, go through Irish courts to get the data released.Yea I agree and that crossed my mind, but I think it's in our best interest as a country to have this ordered denied. Will criminals get away with things? Sure, but there have always been other means of investigation and this isn't their only option. "
"I do not think the investigative benefits out weigh the societal benefits of keeping our governments powers in check. They pretty much do whatever they want now, and I don't think this minute limitation will hurt them in any meaningful way. > Not necessarily, if the h.q. is foreign but they have a server in the U.S., that U.S. Server may be accessible but they wouldn't be able to use that to get information from other foreign servers."
"That is true, but I was more talking about if they had any staff members in the states. The government could try going after them and prosecuting them or finding them in contempt of court until their parent company complies. "
">I think the order should be denied and the government should work with their foreign counterparts"
"100% agree. You don't even need staff members. It's about 'doing business' in the US. Even if you had no operations, the US could compel VISA/Mastercard to not accept payments from US customers to you. I believe this has happened before.But I imagine you can only be forced to hand over data regarding your US operations."
"For example, a European company operating in the US would not have to hand over server data based in Europe (or at least server data pertaining to non-US citizens)."
"Meanwhile Microsoft can be forced to hand over *all* it's data, wherever it's based. That's a significant difference.The US can demand whatever they want. And if it's ruled so in secret FISA court, they can prevent you from doing business in the US. Technically they can't *force* you to hand over non-US info, but they can definitely make it economically unfeasible for you to not.Which is why companies and not only data is starting to move overseas.In our control-obsessed politicians' attempts to solidify their elite status in society and wrap everyone in a plastic bubble for *safety*, they're really destroying the economic engine of this country. The government needs to get out of our lives for the most part. The less involuntary interaction the better.That's because Microsoft is based in the US. If they were say completely based in Ireland this wouldn't be an issue.United States reached out and ended Megaupload, a New Zealand company. This was years ago and they're still preventing Megaupload from accessing their data.>Completely based in Ireland this wouldn't be an issue."
"No big company nowadays is completely based in one country, the internet is global by design. Every tech company will have operations in the U.S. If those get threatened for not carrying out something in a different part of the world in the interest of one country, it's just going to break up the internet. Could you imagine if China said to Microsoft's China division we will sue your Chinese division and take all your assets if you don't provide us with emails in the states, people would go apeshit."
"Plus my point was there was no point leaving operations, they will just threaten any assets you have left in the U.S.I really can't wait for China to do that, if anything just to see the people in Washington get up on the podium and be as hypocritical as humanly possible. You realize Obama just said he would start a cyberwar with China if they keep hacking.  Meanwhile our own 'cyber intelligence' (god I hate that term) actively compromises other country's government systems and private systems.  We are a country built basically on hypocrisy. As usual, relevant xkcd: http://xkcd.com/1573/"
"> The obvious flaw in this system is that the government could potentially force Apple to add an additional public key to your account, which would be analogous to registering an extra device"
"How will they get this public key? Can you generate a new public key without the access to the private key? If so, isn't the whole system broken?What that means is that they generate new public/private key pair. The private key belongs to themselves and is not seen by anyone else. By adding their public key to the target account, other people sending a message to the target account would then also encrypt it with that public key that can be decrypted with their private key."
"The reason this works is that iMessage wants you to be able to read your message on multiple devices without you having to copy over the private key. It also means that you can revoke iMessage access for a specific device later on (if you get rid of an iPad, iPhone, or laptop to upgrade it to a newer version)."
"All of that makes sense. Right now you get a popup whenever a new private/public key pair is added to your account on all connected devices. The government could force them to implement a way to add new pairs silently."
"The alternative to this model is a model where everyone that talks to you needs to know what devices belong to you. That means people messaging you would need to take action (for instance by confirming a popup) whenever you add a new device to your account. Since that's a pretty common event and you have a lot of contacts it would make things way more complex.That's not how it works."
"Apple runs what amounts to a phone book lookup service, where your device public key is listed."
"They can add new keys at will, and iMessage clients don't tell you what public keys your recipients is said to have. So they can add a keypair they control, instead of just keypairs the recipient controls. Wouldn't Apple's notification system of when new devices are added to your account mean you'd receive a notification? I assume that notification is triggered by the creation of a new key associated with a device?Not necessarily. The notification exists for the security of the end-user. If Apple were compelled to add another device to the account, only for surveillance purposes, it would clearly be under a gag order to do so, and would not notify the end user.Shut your doors, Apple."
"Send everyone on vacation, and stop all development, manufacturing, and support. Close every Apple Store, and shut down every manufacturing plant. Issue a statement that you'd rather see Apple vanish than capitulate to government bullies."
"They can't *make* you work, but I'm sure you won't be on vacation long when a billion consumers start demanding that the government back off."
"Make history once again. Don't compromise, don't negotiate, don't back down or capitulate. Tell the government **no**, and don't lift a finger until they leave you alone."
"*EDIT 1: RIP, inbox, Saturday.*"
"*EDIT 2: Thank you, kind stranger for the Gold.*"
"*EDIT 3: Yes, I'm aware there's a bit of hyperbole in the explanation above, but the general sensibility that Apple should make a BIG HAIRY DEAL out of being PUNISHED for REFUSING TO COMPLY with the government's demand that they cripple their security features remains. I realize they have shareholders to satisfy, but I DON'T think a general strike - if handled with principle and courage - would, in the long term, cause Apple's demise. Even if it did, it would be far better to see them crushed into nonexistence than to be broken and made a tool for government. Apple needs to fight this HARD.*[deleted]where's that commercial...Dude, can you imagine if one of the largest companies to ever exist shut themselves down entirely, just to tell the government *no?*. To say that you are repeatedly and aggressively trying to bully us into giving you data on our customers, and we won't do it. We would rather watch our company die than to hand it over to you, so we are done operating until you stop."
"I don't think they'd ever do it, but think about if they actually did. That *would* be history.Wouldn't it make more sense for Apple to just move their entire operation to a different country? I mean, probably, but that's not what we were talking about.Well, having the U.S. Government cripple a linchpin of even the global economy out of authoritarian and tyrannical reasons may make history. "
"I really kind of hope Apple, MS, and Google work together on this. Maybe they should shut down all their services for a single day. Maybe even with a message train your weapons on the capital or whatever the chick in the final Hunger Games says.When was the last time a global company told the state it wasn't going to so much as cut the grass or sweep the floors until it backed off?That's not what he had a problem with, it's saying they already made history. I don't get how you couldn't see that..."
"Edit: Not my view, just saying that it was quite obvious what he meant, even if you disagree.I'd say the apple 2 was a big enough deal that it deserves a spot in history. The rest of it, not so much.The iPhone has shaped modern life/society as significantly as just about anything else in the last 20 years.  I won't make the claim it was the first smartphone, but it was the first one that matters.World's first smartphone."
"It may not be the signing of the Declaration of Independence, but in technological and social terms, the iPhone is quite a historic achievement.I#d love to see you sensibly define the term 'smartphone' in such a way that the iPhone was the first."
"The first fashionable smartphone, perhapsIt's simple, isn't it? The first Internet-capable phone with a full-fledged browser, a touchscreen large enough, high enough  in resolution and responsive enough to use for extensive web browsing, full email capabilities, etc. that was actually usable and capable enough to bring the concept to the masses. "
"Sure, there were smart phones before the iPhone. I've used them all, and they were all complete and utter shit. "
"The iPhone was the first phone of its kind. No keys, no stylus necessary, no WAP, a fully HTML compliant browser that understood CSS... There was nothing even remotely like it before the iPhone. Saying otherwise is ridiculously disingenuous. First decent smartphoneThe iPhone (2007) [wasn't in any way the word's first smartphone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone#History)."
"The IBM Simon (1992) was the first phone with PDA features, and was literally the first device called a smartphone. NTT DoCoMo released a series of smartphones that were the first to get mainstream adoption in Japan in 1999. The Ericsson R30 (2000) was the first phone to be marketed with the term smartphone, and had PDA and web browsing features."
"Why is the iPhone important? It was *so much better* than all the smartphones before it, and was the first smartphone to gain widespread mass adoption among people who weren't geeks and business people in the US. It was multitouch only, which was relatively new at the time. It had the best mobile web browser at the time (being able to show non stripped down or reformatted pages with an interface that made it pleasant was revolutionary). It also had a waaay better interface than anything else that existed at the time."
"Apple is rarely the first in a product category. They refine the hell out of existing ideas and open up product categories to new audiences. "
"Sent from my iPhone. :)[I mean Google did in 2010.](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704117304575137960803993890)The British East Indian Company once WAS a state.The Dutch East India Company laugh at your puny excuse of an Indian CompanyJust scrolled up to make sure I wasn't on /r/appleWhy, because for once Reddit isn't taking every possible stab at Apple they can?"
"Yeah, it is weird.iPod and iPhone."
"'Nuff said.> A bit hyperbolic perhaps?"
"Yeah. Being the biggest company in history doesn't constitute Making history.Holy shit this is so factually inaccurate.  And up voted highly.  And all the responses pointing this out are down voted.  "
"Oh reddit.  You are such a suckhole of shit sometimes.  Rofl, literally anything is making history you can draw the line wherever.Eli Whitney is famous, I learned about him in atleast 4 different grades, and all he did was invent the fucking cotton gin. I think the smart phone is atleast as historic. Apple didn't invent the smart phone. People seem to forget that Windows Mobile and Blackberry devices were out before 2007.  I got the first iPhone when it came out, sure.  I was tired of the brick that I'd been carrying.  But I was quickly pissed off to find some very basic features that I'd been using for years were completely missing from it.You mean like copy/paste? Or a decent touch screen?That and no MMS were the two that I remember most. Apple invented the iPhone, which was the first smartphone people wanted to use. Apple gets no claim to fully inventing most of their popular consumer product's as a segment but what they did was they created a phone people wanted, a tablet people wanted, and computer people wanted, etc. which certainly gave birth to segments like smartphones and tablets.It's hard to pinpoint what exactly made the original iPhone special, but two things really stand out for me: a capacitive touchscreen and the application store. Apple executed really well in those two areas.And that's why they made money.When the original iPhone was released on June 27th, 2007 there wasn't an appstore yet. The iPhone App Store opened on July 10, 2008, via an update to iTunes. The original plan was for the phone to run webapps developed by third parties along with the native apps that came with the phone. Yeah, I shouldn't have said the original iPhone. Just in general, I think why the iPhone kicked everyone's ass is because of those two things. Here's an [interesting graph](http://www.statista.com/statistics/263401/global-apple-iphone-sales-since-3rd-quarter-2007/) showing sales. The App Store really changed the game for them imo.Apple doesn't invent anything. They *create* demand. They take an idea, make it incredibly consumer friendly and market it better than any other company on the planet. "
"For what it's worth, this isn't a bad thing. The residual benefits to even their closest competitors, by creating new markets, has been incalculable. Well. With the exception of Blackberry. But that was RIM's own fault for not being able to adapt quickly.what?"
"Samsung is much bigger than Apple. "
"Hell, Samsung more or less makes everything. "
"Fridges, washers, driers, monitors, computers, CPUs, RAM, TVs, apartment complexes, Military equipment, etc. "
"Apple makes a few phones and computers. >> biggest company in history"
"Pre 17th century joint stock companies? Late 19th - early 20th century monopoly companies?Not even closeapple isn't and has never been the biggest company in history...I'd say the VOC was the biggest company in history. "
"If the VOC existed in 2015 they would just have taken Washington and stormed the White House with their armyThe East India Company probably takes that title. > don't lift a finger until they leave you alone."
"Well - there's one finger they could raise....Um...APPL shareholder here; please don't do this Apple.For real. I always wondered what would happen if a company like Apple could somehow leverage their popularity to make the govt back off.There is an amusing irony in here about how we hate it that large corporations have such power over the legislative process (lobby groups, sponsoring campaigns, etc), but in this case we do seem to want that power of a large corporation. Not judging anything, just an observation.Oh you want a PR war? Just let the government get their paedophile and terrorist card deck out...The government will just round up the executives and jail them on trumped-up charges, claim they are engaging in economic terrorism or some such nonsense.  ...who is John Galt? The iPhone is the engine of the world?...I'd actually buy something Apple if they did this and the dust finally settled.  #AppleBlackout"
"I want to believe.If we had voted for people who actually are for minimal government interaction and regulation in our lives, we wouldn't be here with the NSA requesting our dick pics. The candidates have been there. We should expect better from politicians, but you can really thank the lowest common denominator majority of this country for a lot of it.Regulation's good, dick pic collectors are bad. These two things are very, very different. I like regulation. It's kind of an important part of what prevents us from becoming a banana republic.I didn't say no regulation, just minimal. The state serves a purpose: rummaging through pictures of my barbecue party are not one of them and the idea that it even *might* be is moronic. Get a warrant in a non-secret federal court like it's supposed to be.We're on the same page thereThis is some Atlas Shrugged level shitIf they did this, I'd buy like 10 ipads afterwards.I've never owned an apple product in my life,but if they pulled this off my next phone would be an iPhone. nice try Microsoft CEOMicrosoft? Apple and Microsoft *love* each other these days. Microsoft had a pride-of-place spot in Apple's most recent announcement, demonstrating Office for iPad on the new 12 inch iPad."
"Nice try, Google CEO would have been a better fit, these days, or Samsung CEO.Please do this apple.  I will buy Apple for life if they do this.Honestly I would convert to Apple in that case. I know Google sold out, and has Microsoft, so, yeah, I would convert to Apple if they're going to be respective of privacy.Hmm. Stop making money hand over fist or comply with the government because the people you sell to aren't individuals. They're sales figures."
"While I agree with you, something like that will never happen when you're in the business of making a fuck ton of money.I think they would."
"I think their stock would SOAR if they stood up to the government."
"They'd make so much money the iPhone 7 would be *free*.Yeaaaa, that's not how the real world works. Sorry, kiddo. Again I doubt it. The market is based off of investors. Investors care about money. If a company suddenly stops making any money whatsoever investors will scatter like rats in the light making their stock crash."
"And Apple would never give away a phone for free. That company (and many others) do everything in their power to milk you for any extra cent they can. Custom charge ports, custom cables, custom docks, etc."
"Them refusing to allow a backdoor isn't about protecting their users. It's about the bad publicity it would garner them if they were to actually do so and because they don't want an outside entity being able to play around in their system.That's just a little hyperbole, but it's not entirely fantastic: they did make OSX free, and *lots* of development money and resources goes into that.It may be free to upgrade, but the computers still cost an arm and a leg, partially to cover development costs. It's not as if they're giving the OS away, just free upgrades[deleted]> They'd make so much money the iPhone 7 would be free."
"I wish it worked that way.> I think their stock would SOAR if they stood up to the government."
"If you think shutting down all production would make stock soar, my advice to you is to keep hold of your money.Why would their stock soar? They would be losing money every minute they are shut. The stock would do the opposite>Why would their stock soar? They would be losing money every minute they are shut. The stock would do the opposite"
"Until the government backed down, then it would soar. Who wouldn't want the device the government can't spy on, made by a company who stood up for your privacy.If they stopped selling product, their stock would tank. It would also cause havoc on the market due to their market cap being so large.Yep. And the world would know that they'd rather close than sell out their customers. It would effect all markets. US tech would tank soon after, illustrating the government's unreasonable demand for back doors. The gov't would have to back down. Apple's devices would be in greater demand than ever for being secure.> The gov't would have to back down"
"Are you kidding? Clearly you haven't had many dealings with the US government. Stubborn executives would have tragic automobile accidents while CIA operatives whistled innocently before the government would back down.Also, tempting the US government's regulatory pimp hand by challenging its authority has never really worked out great.Yep. Ask yahoo about it.*I work in television.*Plus, Apple probably has the money to deny the order, and failing that, lawyers to hold the order up in court for decades.Apple makes money on hardware, not user data like Google. They have a huge incentive to not give in.What do you think the lawsuit is going to cost them? Air?For a company which had more cash on hand than the government a few years ago, can't say cost is a major concern for them.  Now that this is in the news, and all eyes are on Apple, folding to government pressure would tarnish their image and potentially cost them far more than the cost of the lawsuit.While I agree that shutting down completely is not an option for Apple, if they were as cynical as you're suggesting, then why haven't they folded already? If they don't care about consumers (of which they are as well) then why take this to court in the first place? Just automatically comply with the govt., because it doesn't matter, right? Or maybe even the people who run soulless corporations also have lines in the sand that they don't want to cross. That fighting, and even losing can bring these govt. over-reaches to light and hopefully generate enough anger from the populous to change the direction of this surveillance state. Or not, whatever. Back to Crossyroad.[Feels relevant.](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/99449/3779149-no+you+move+cap+says.jpg)I wish yahoo would have stood firm and gone down in flames as the American government crushed it for not complying with a tyrannical order. It would have been the best way to go out, because now, yahoo is just atrophying into nothingness. At least that way people would have heralded yahoo as heroes instead of a footnote.Exactly. Don't negotiate with terrorists. Could you imagine if they released a statement that they do not negotiate with any form of terrorism, whether it be domestic or abroad and that they consider what the government is doing to be terroristic "
"Would be amazing. Foreign or Domestic Welcome to The RockWinners go home and fuck the prom queen. "
"Carla *was* the prom queen. It's things like this that make me hate being an American. Why the fuck does our government feel they reserve this right, regardless of democrat or republican?  "
"Having access to citizens' private data hasn't actually deterred any crime or criminal activity in the last few years. NSA and TSA are gigantic farces that don't do any public good. It's all a fucking mess. And it's heartbreaking. "
"I hate that Apple must lead the fight when it should be every single tech company and every single person because we're all being affected. I wonder what would happen if Apple or Yahoo went bankrupt resisting. Stocks would plummet and people would be outraged. Maybe it would be a catalyst for change. The competitors will just step in, comply and double down. It's a cut throat world. If Apple shut their doors in protest, Google and its Android manufacturers would reap the rewards. There's a reason that you don't see a big conglomerate of these companies banding together to fight this - Apple doesn't see user data and doesn't sell access to it. Other companies do. With its current setup, Apple literally cannot access the data and hand it over. Google combs through every piece of your data already. While it's true that Apple is choosing to stay out of the information business, the issue of government surveillance impacts the entire IT sector. The idea that all American companies have to hand over everyone's data is incredibly damaging to the industry as a whole. The only reason Google can't fight against the government the same way as Apple is because it needs access to user data in order to function, whereas Apple does not. Other than that they are on the same side and both are most likely putting pressure on the government. You just don't hear about it because of the gag orders.If the second largest company in the world went bankrupt over this, there would be backlash.  Only if the public could stay misinformed over the first companies reasons for being bankrupt. Man those tech companies could just send a fucking email to every customer and they had greater coverage than any news agency in a minute. They U.S is fucking over it's tech buisnesses so hard especially U.S buisnesses with cloud services, the U.S is going to stop being the tech capital of the world. With the NSA and Microsoft being forced to hand over data from Ireland countries outside of the U.S are starting to not trust companies inside the U.S. Which is bad news for companies like Apple because their growth market is outside of the U.S. They should literally comply."
"They should literally hand over a copy of the messages as they transit through their servers."
"If that happens to look like random noise that's the government's problem."

How are we even supposed to fight something we can't know anything about?iMessage is encrypted. It uses keys that's on users iPhone. Apple can't decrypt it because they don't have the keys required to. They just transfer encrypted data. The poster is saying Apple should send over the encrypted data and it's the governments problem to decrypt it.Just begin by posting the important stuff unencrypted. You know, politicians' and high-level government employees' logs.No.  They should print each one on a post it and mail them in.

Fight this. Don't back down. Apple, in refusing to help the government violate the fourth amendment, is doing the job that the courts are failing to do.

The Baltimore riots didn't do jack shit.Yeah this is going a bit overboard. Not worth rioting, but certainly worth contacting our representatives and voting with our money.because the Baltimore shit is about people being literally murdered, whereas a privacy invasion is much higher on the hierarchy of needs.I hate fuckers like you that make issues a competition. The government survellence is very important issue but that doesn't mean the baltimore thing isn't. For the people living in baltimore it effects their lives a lot more than privacy invasion. Government privacy invasion isn't a reason to not protest over racist police brutality...For starters, this issue, just like with TPP, isn't really seen as a personal threat by the majority who hear about it. It's just too abstract for most people. I really admire Cook & Co for standing up, but it needs to be a much bigger movement involving all kinds of companies. If there is anything Apple does, it's the ability to get consumers to believe in something. I think they could get the ball rolling on this if push comes to shove. Silicon Valley needs to relocate all assets to a new country. They need to pull together money to buy Greece. Apple could do it all on their own with change left for Starbucks and Voodoo.At least it a company that can afford a few billions in fines.Yahoo faced fines of 250,000/day, doubling every month."
"Exercise for the reader: when would Apple fully spend the 200 billion they have in cash?Just ignore the unreasonable fine. Done. Lets say that the fines start on 10/1/2015 at $250,000/day. "
"October costs them $7.75 million, not too crazy.  "
"November costs them $15 million, still barely mattering to them.  "
"By April 2016, they're at $16 million per day though, that month costs them $480 million.  Starts hurting a lot."
"At the $200 billion mark, they would run out of money on 12/19/2016 after over a year of paying the fines.  The daily fine at that point is over $4 billion. Daily. "
"To make it to 1/1/2017, the cost would be  $251,295,750,000."
"----"
"Fun addition:  The current US National Debt is about $18.3 trillion according to http://www.usdebtclock.org/#"
"If the fines kept going in a similar fashion, Apple's total payment would surpass the current national debt on 7/5/2017.  At this point in the pay scheme, the daily fine would be $524 billion."
"By the start of 2018, the daily fine would be $33.5 trillion.19-20 months, so about a year and a halfWow this shit is ridiculous. Forcing companies to allow the government to spy on whoever they want. Shit needs to change or eventually people will get feed up and the news will be talking about mass movement of Americans to other countries and American refuges escape an every more control and restricting government. People love to shit on apple for a lot of reasons. But when push comes to shove they stand by their morals fairly often. Ive always been proud of them putting their money where their mouth is. I'll say it bluntly. My life is boring. I eat, sleep, shit, work, watch shit, play some shit and so it goes. At the end of the day, I'm a boring person and could give a rats ass if the government saw my shit. But you know what, it's none of your fucking business. Nothing but a bunch of disingenuous assholes who have no right to know about me if I'm not committing anything illegal that they can directly see. If I take the risk of committing illegal activities than I'll pay the consequence when you catch me. But don't drag every other innocent person through some bullshit spy game for the greater good. It's not your business to know or even glimpse at how Americans conduct there daily life's. Leave us the fuck alone.This is going to make it hard for some people to bash Apple as much as they usually do.No it won't. The circlejerk never stops.It funny how people always make Apple out as the evil guys in tech. Mean while Microsoft is recording every action you do on windows 10, even sneaking some of the stuff onto windows 7. And well, google probably knows all of your personal details and sells everything about.  Hope and change everybody.I can't help but wonder how much of this is a lack of change due to politicians' apathy and how much is a lack of change because the NSA has them all by the nips and knows all their career-ending secrets. But will anyone.... face... time??? TeeheeheeeApple refuses backdoor access, they get a wimpy fine."
"I refuse backdoor access and I don't get my internship. "
"Go figure.It's not even in refusing back door access. From my understanding: There WAS no backdoor access. That is to say, that the government is suing Apple for committing the unforgivable sin of allowing for the mobile communication between two parties that is incapable of having its meaning intercepted by a third party. And I don't even think there is evil intent here. It's just a bunch of fucking control freaks who can't stand that making good technology comes with the price of enabling criminals who now have the ability to utilize it. And this power isn't the ability to cause massive kinetic damage to a wide area. It's simply the ability to communicate with the peace of mind that someone can't intercept that communications. Well, either everyone has potential access to those communications or no one does, because hackers have the same ability to get through those backdoors as any suit.If Apple switches from their current model I will very disappointed and will consider getting a different device when I upgrade. I consider Apple to be ahead of all the other because of their iMessage privacyThis is the kind of shit people need to get pissed over.Why would the government need access to everyone?  While they claim it is about security, it hasn't stopped anything so far with what they have already got.  So this leads some thought that rather than looking out for terrorists, this data is looking for dissidence.  While you think the government is working hard to protect you, they really are working hard to make sure there is no revolution against the upcoming fascism.I'm a little surprised to see Apple refusing backdoor data access but I'm glad they're being the good guys. This is total corruption though, and completely unacceptable.Why would you be surprised? Historically Apple has always been ahead of the pack regarding user privacy. Apple has always been a laissez-faire business. They believe in their ecosystem and they determine who accesses what. I use to hate that but as I grow older and have less time to tinker... I like that Apple takes a lot of my headache away via this. Oh, wherever shall they find the resources to fight this in court?  I think Apple products are overpriced and unimpressive, but one thing I really applaud them is their commitment to privacy. I'm looking for a new phone this year and since most Android manufacturers are now charging iPhone-prices for their top models anyway, it may be the first time I'm buying an Apple product since the scroll-wheel iPod over a decade ago.I don't particularly like apple, but kudos to them for this!So what law are the feds allegedly enforcing that allows them to make such an order and levy the fine for contempt? They just make some shit up, and if the other party doesn't comply, they fine them into submission?"
"This is some 'we demand a shrubbery!' shit.This reminds me of something Dennis Miller said when the justice department was fining Microsoft $1M per day. At this rate they'll be broke just ten years after the earth goes crashing into the sun.Why would anyone want to start a business in the US with these far reaching fees. I am surprised many aren't leaving all together.So...if the fines and court procedures are secret...how do they enforce them? Seems the solution here is to station TV cameras outside of your doors and just not pay the fines. If they're bold enough to place sanctions against you, the PR would be horrific.Pass the fines on to government contracts. NSA wants back doors ... sure, that'll be $5 Trillion dollars. And then use the money to creat an even more secure service. Our government is an abhorrent abomination. What a sick state we are in that a secret police can run a company directly into oblivion for failure to comply with spying on whatever it wants. What happen to the land of the freedom?"
"USA has become worst than third world countries. The day Apple compromises its security practices is the day they lose me as a customer. I wish all giant telecoms and tech companies like Google and MS were as staunch in their stance on customer privacy and encryption as Apple is. As a detractor of Apple I support them here anyway.  Fight the good fight, Apple.Apple may be douchy from time to time but at least they give the gov the fingerFuck all of you at the NSA, you nosey motherfuckers.What if Cook and Apple are all smoke and mirrors? What if they are going along with the back door but want it to look like they are not? "
"Why harm the most valuable company in the world. Apple has 100s of billions of liquid cash. They can actually pay fines. It will give them an enormous brand advantage."
"Usually not a big fan of Apple for their prices and other issues, but this makes me respect them more.This is why I buy Apple. Their prices completely justify not getting snooped by the US Gov. "
"*And* why is it the US Gov? Why not **my** Government?! It's THAT which makes me angry about this. Heck! I even threw away those stupid padlocks with the US Master Key thing, because why should *just* America get access to my personal belongings and not my British government. How paranoid of a country do you need to be to have the need to snoop around into people's stuff?!vote harderHe is not even in the US how the f does he vote for a US party.[deleted]From what I can tell Apple do a damn sight more than Android and Windows."
"I'm not a terrorist, so I won't buy a black phone. I just think it's really intrusive having a foreign government looking at my stuff...[deleted]A black phone is just going to make you look mega-suspect.what's a black phone?Super nerdy phone for the ultra-paranoid. Uses some tech which supposedly stops all forms of spying and such. Yet it runs a form of Android *soooooooo....?*The problem with those options is that they require the people you're connecting with to have the same super rare security measures. iMessage just requires another iPhone, which is pretty common. [deleted]You're custom Android rom protects you,  but not any of your communications, that's what I was talking about. [deleted]Of course  that's an issue, it's an issue for every secure messaging system. Adoption is the biggest hurdle. But, Apple has had the benefit of pushing out iMessage as the default messaging system between millions of iPhones. "
"I don't know much about Hangouts' encryption. But if its encrypted in the same way, Google has done a terrible job of getting that info out there. Not unless Hangouts was updated to add end to end encryption within the past few months."
"http://www.phonearena.com/news/Google-Hangouts-doesnt-use-end-to-end-encryption_id69248Fines. This is all a facade to make it seem like the NSA doesn't have access. We'll find out in a year or two that they still have a backdoor in all of these companies that are  fighting the man. I don't trust any of them.  The problem with this... the way iMessage works, apple doesn't even know what is being transmitted across their servers.  They know the public key, but they don't know the private key.  This is why, if you forget your iCloud password and have to reset it, you lose all your text messages, your device can no longer decrypt them.Why don't all the other multibillion dollar companies have the same stories about them?  Maybe there's something different about Apple?  Conspiracies are fun, but paranoia is tiresome.The fuck? I hope all companies start paying these fines and demonstrate the cost that this type of surveillance is costing on US businesses.The real evil empire"
"All communications should be encrypted, using proper (no back door) techniques, with the user(s) being the only ones who define the encryption keys. Hardly. It would be nice to see some of the guys who can afford it tackling the government on fourth amendment rights..."
"That would be nice to see for a change.If I were them I'd say fuck you, I'm moving the entire company base to Sweden who I'm sure would be glad to have more jobs and the US gov't can eat a dick!> The company was faced with daily fines of $250,000 per day, which would double each month. By month five, Yahoo would have faced fines upwards of the entire U.S. national debt, and then some."
"TIL: the national debt is less than $250 million! So that's good news. So we hand over the few remaining pieces of private information to the government--that's terrible and bullshit."
"What's worse is that the US government keeps getting hacked and/or lets it's ppl run out with unencrypted data."
"This is surrender of all info to the world, not just the US.If I could mark down a reason for the purchase, I'd go buy something on iTunes right now."

"Bullshit, this is a call for criminals to get lazy.Man, what will they ever do? It's not like they have more money than they could spend in a decade just lying around. I hope they stand up and keep refusing.You know what Apple, feel free to keep doing this and pass along the fines to us.  It's one I'll happily help finance. This is ridiculous. You can't threaten to fine a company because they aren't doing something that is impossible.All I see here is, Apple paying fines because back doors cannot be trusted like the government cannot be trusted.It's against reason, the companies will and interest and the public interest. How can it be possible? And it's being handled in secrecy. Wtf Go on apple! Pay those fines and keep the doors locked.Really want to see these fines in comparison to the HSBC drug cartel money laundering fine and the LIBOR fixing fines.Sealed criminal case in a secret court...... everything is going fine!Apple and my girlfriend both Do you want to convince tech companies to abandon the USA as its HQ? Because this is how you do it. Our government is so corrupt its a wonder we have allies.Im sure Apple will happily pay the fine and continue to not give access to what they dont haveIsn't that extortion?I suggest we file a class-action lawsuit against the federal government."
"I've written my name on 1000 rounds of Freedom, how about you?Everyone I'm here is talking about privacy rights and the role of government, and I'm just here giggling  every time someone says backdoor access.I mean, when you get right down to it, does a pristine company like Apple really seem like an anal kind of gal?If our government is bought and paid for by the rich, the ones to create all these secret courts, and happen to be major share holders in Apple, then fine away. "
"Then maybe once their own draconian corruption and manipulation of laws will hit them in the pocket book. I bet they have half of congress' personal phone numbers on speed dial."
"Watch how quickly those secret courts go away then."
"Say what you want about Apple, the company has many flaws, but they're very openly and strongly on the side of privacy for their users. Apple knows that if it did allow government back doors, people would be lining up - not to buy stuff, but to return stuff. and people who are under contracts wouldn't want another iPhone once the contract expired.Do you want highly profitable tech companies to move out of your country?  This is how you get that done.Man, as much as I'm not a fan of Apple products, I have a lot of respect for them defending their customers. I guess this is where your overpriced money is going.It's a fuking hype to say how safe apple is. It's all bullshit. Wait until u find out there is an backdoor in about 10 months from now. This is eventually going to lead to the government poking around in our shit for no reason Just like when the police stop you without a cause.The American public is too busy voting on polarizing social issues that politicians use as a wedge. As different as George Bush and Barrack Obama can be, they have a lot in common that the general public fails to see. If the U.S. someday becomes a full on totalitarian state, it won't be one parties fault. The people voted for this shit time and time again. But hey, if he's pro life or pro choice, or whatever I think is right, who cares ...My girlfriend refused backdoor access.  Can I fine her?If you ask me, the US got the data a long time ago with an NSL. This is all just a smoke screen to not make the US look bad.Microsoft is pulling the same type of PR stunt."
"Oh yes, but its not really a PR stunt if they're forced to do it."
"I imagine the NSL says something like Give us the data, but continue to play-fight us in the legal system, so that we do not scare people away from American businesses. We'll slowly drop the case after the public moves on.I have a question. How does something like this affect other countries like Canada who sell/manufacture Apple products (or other products).  Does the US still have the ability/jurisdiction to access our data through a backdoor of this sort?Probably, it is like how they wanted to get the emails from Microsoft for servers based in Ireland. The US government seems to want to be able to easily access any data from US based companies.Or.face.time.http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4534082/fbi-data-encryption"
"Something WE have to talk about.   Yeah, I love how they say WE are talking about it.  Aka you try to tell companies and people what to do.Mister Potatohead.. MISTER POTATOHEAD - BACK DOORS are NOT a secret!Weren't we all just against an act to allow corporations to sue governments when government policy impacted profit? What effects does a move like this have if the company could sue the government?One thought I have is that they have only a chance of doing this because Apple is a U.S. company. They couldn't do anything if, .e.g., a Chinese company did the same thing and sold the devices (perhaps through a black market) in the U.S. "
"Of course the other option is simply to use third party apps to do the encryption, which is what anyone who really cares would use. But of course, then they would flag themselves. The whole point of this is that if everyone is using encryption, then there is no flag to point out individual users.It seems having no access to the data yourself is no longer a good reason. I suppose they expect Apple to reengineer their apps to be less secure and include backdoor functionality and forcibly push out updates to everyone to force them to use it."
"I guess the next step is more decentralized protocols, or have a third party add an encryption layer onto someone else's centralized protocol (so that that someone else has no way to add in a backdoor for the gov't).Every tech company has buckled and handed over PII data to the feds.  How can Apple possibly succeed?According to the gubmint, various financial institutions were too big to fail.  Is Apple too big to fine out of existance?Can't we write to our Senators and ask them to stop the fines?Apple executives need to flat out refuse, not pay the fines, then be taken at gun point to prison. Then the politicians responsible would have their careers destroyed by citizens,  or they would change their ways and relent. Either way, the execs get released immediately. they shouldn't be getting fined.  "
"Obama's the one pushing for all this spying too, he's expanded bush policy.Oh dang, they may have to actually dip into the petty cash."
"If the government gets their way, I want the government account to be visible to all iPhone users. And when they access data, the user should be notified. If only they had cash on hand to pay it! Fines for warrant less searches.....Backdoor = ButtrapeSo, anyone wanna buy a Nokia 8110?Apple may not have the keys, but they certainly could be coerced (and likely already have been) into providing a mechanism to get the keys on demand from one of the end devices. Suppose the government imposes the same sort of exponentially increasing sanctions that they did with Yahoo!. They presumably have the ability to compel payment through control of the banking system. Suppose that Apple stands on its principle and stubbornly refuses to comply. All of this, of course, is under a gag order because it is being done by a secret court for secret reasons, so the public doesn't know about it."
"What happens when Apple runs out of money? Do the Apple Stores and online services just close down? Or does the government step in and take over operations? Given that the government will still wish to maintain secrecy, can they release (or force Apple to release) faux financial statements that pretend Apple still has all its money? How far could this sham be carried?[deleted]use a non-company-encumbered linuxThey can write it off as PR expenditures.[I wish I had the last 20 seconds of my life back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEL65gywwHQ)Apple should move out of US.  If Apple doesn't give in here, I'd go back to using their products again.  What I'm really curious about is the supposed vulnerability of Signal.On one hand they can probably pay for the fines from stylus sales alone, on the other hand good on them!Hardly likely as they pride themselves from being a Californian company (and it would also be seen as a sort of *loss* if they did so) - but can they just relocate outside of the jurisdiction of the U.S.?apple is as rich as nazis, whatever fines they incur would be like shooting BB's at a tank. I'm pretty sure that Apple can pay whatever fine the government wants to pay them... In fact, in a few years they'll probably be able to pull a Pablo Escobar and offer to pay down the national debt if only they get special concessions...Bad guys will just eventually move to custom communication apps.I'm sure they can afford the fines. They deserve it for keeping so much money outside the country. I do believe they've got some cash to burn anyway...More than most country's GDPApple has more revenue than all but 19 country's GDP. They don't care. Welcome to Obama's America. But they can afford it so it's cool, right?I miss TrueCrypt ;(Thank you Apple!!I'm just here so I won't get finedSerious question: What happens if they just ignore fines and threats from secret government entities. What could they possibly do? If said entities take action on a large enough scale they'd have to admit their existence or justify their actions to the public.Thank you apple! Fuck the government, thinking they have the right. Every time I read articles like this, I feel betrayed. I feel like I need to take action somehow to stop the invasion of privacy, even if its not my place in society right now.I hope the government tries to force them and Apple simply leaves. Takes themselves and all their revenue to some nation or island with no such laws. Followed by every other major such source of revenue. Then, if we could just go after the traitors plying their skills to the NSA and FBI, we'd be set. "
"The alternative is we lose our rights and privacy, and no other nation allows our tech, costing us horribly in the long run. TIL apple isn't down with analLet them face the fines, their stock holders will take the hit and complain. It's not their fault for doing the right thing.Government has enough data as is to catch terrorists.  This is a power grab to deal with American troublemakers."
"Everything we have don't post 9-11 has been a setup for some future dictator to run roughshod over us.ITT: finally some love for apple :PDoesn't Apple have more money that the US Government?Why can't we have nice things? > The administration pushed for contempt, at which point Yahoo buckled. The company was faced with daily fines of $250,000 per day, which would double each month. By month five, Yahoo would have faced fines upwards of the entire U.S. national debt, and then some."
"I really doubt they would have gone through with that, not with Yahoo and certainly not with Apple (or Google or MS for that matter). This would basically mean that the US government is socializing the biggest company in the world for its refusal the help do something most people are skeptical about."
"This would certainly have far reaching implementations for not only foreign investors but also other companies in the states.Obama can suck a dick."
"-Tim CookSo release the software with the backdoor. Then offer a separate download to patch the hole. The software has the hole as our oppressive govt requires, but people still have the ability to protect themselves. Come on Apple, just a little bit of backdoor action, promise only the tip. as much as I dislike icrap products (they really are crap) I think this could be interesting IF APPLE is willing to go all in and ask for help from the people."
"ie simply refuse to comply and when sanctions come refuse to pay."
"let the government dismantle the company and let the people respond."
"might be very very interesting.My girlfriend usually refuses backdoor access too, but I always get my way. who wants someone to enter in the back door really?Like Lavabit? eli5, seriously... why do these companies still stay in the USA?  They should pack the hell up and go overseas.  How awesome would it be in light of these issues for Apple, Google, etc to announce they are leaving the USA and taking with them 100's of billions of dollars and 100,000's of jobs.  Give the US gov the big middle finger.  Might actually get US citizens riled up for once.Anyone ever get the feeling this is all for show and iMessage is already easily accessed?  Me neither. A game is being played on the public and it's this."
"1. Corporations under US jurisdiction must provide law enforcement access."
"2. Apple's iCloud hack and police tool to download the full contents of iOS devices (otherwise known as Celebgate) became widespread knowledge and they had to restore confidence to sell product."
"3. Apple and the government conspired and Apple plays their part by pretending to fight the government."
"4. Morons believe Apple (or another tech company) is actually on their side and they trust Apple has their back, but the government catches them as the spying really never let up at all."
"5. What is changed of course is the FBI wants 24/7 access to iMessages and not having to go through the NSA to get it. Because this is the current setup, the NSA is telling the FBI when it comes across certain crimes, then they hack/backdoor the device, but that's not good enough for them now, they want the real time data like the NSA is getting."
"[Researchers challenge Apple's claim of unbreakable iMessage encryption](http://www.macworld.com/article/2055640/researchers-challenge-apples-claim-of-unbreakable-imessage-encryption.html)That tinfoil hat looks really dumb on you.The article clearly states that iCloud data is accessible and must be served by court order,  but they're talking about iMessage here which is actually encrypted. iCloud data is *hosted* externally to the phone and is not part of this iMessage business at all. Apple has focused on customer privacy for years and made that very clear. It benefits them very little to give the government access to all of the users, not to mention the Apple employees use the same exact stuff as the consumers (iPhones, iMessage, iCloud) which means then the government would be able to spy on the Apple employees and the business itself for any communication on iOS. Maybe you should actually read and know what you're talking about before posting stupid crap like this. Personally, I'm very skeptical about this whole Apple resisting the U.S. government. Here's why - Apple would never be allowed in China to do what it does without giving the Chinese government *some kind* of backdoor. Microsoft did it, too, and Google chose to leave the country instead of doing that. So why would Apple be so special that the Chinese government would leave alone as an exception?"
"If they gave it to the Chinese government, it's not so unbelievable to think they gave it or will give it to the US government too with a little more pressure, while still maintaining the image that it's fighting for your privacy (an image that would also be in the government's favor).If you can prove that and do a defcon talk you have a netsec job waiting for you but I don't think you can back that up.In the Snowden slides Apple was the last major tech company they said they had access to.  That could very well be from them refusing to cooperate at each step.  It's hard to tell if the Snowden ppt files show collusion, or just when the NSA found an exploit.>  Apple would never be allowed in China to do what it does without giving the Chinese government some kind of backdoor"
"How do you *know* this?>Personally, I'm very skeptical"
"These statements don't generally require evidence... reddit isn't a journal.I don't think he/she is calling into question whether he/she is skeptical. Apple allowed the Chinese government to do a Code Audit to see what actually is in iOS. China's government is more concerned with spying from other countries than a citizen over throwing government."
"In theory(I'm a software guy, not networking), the Chinese government can track what messages are being sent where without the ability to read the messages."
"So if anything, if the Chinese Government allows Apple Pay and iMessage to be used, than iOS is as secure as Apple claims it is(Without the BS buzzwords that is).Google didn't leave the country :/"
"They closed one of their products down in the country. One.> Google chose to leave the country instead of doing that"
"hahahahahahahahaThere's actually a surefire way to completely prevent digital spying: free software, which is basically open source software with no restrictions. The only problem is that people aren't willing to give up a few video games to ensure their digital freedom and that of future generations. If you're still using spyware (e.g. Windows 7/8/10, iOS, Google's online services), you're contributing to this problem.It's a good thing that they can afford to pay fines. Not forever. And if you think they'll just stick around and pay them until they go broke, you're mistaken. They'd pull out of the U.S. before that ever happened. But it's not like a start up where they have to comply to stay alive.If they have any balls, they'll leave the US for good and move to a country that does not suck NSA cock.Pretty sure they prefer great heaping piles of money instead of balls.I would say most would...So... let me get this straight, we can now fine women for not allowing back door access? I invite everyone engaged in the pro-Apple circlejerk to read this article regarding FCC software on all phones:"
"It doesn't matter what Apple does [there is a secondary, uncontrolled operating system on every phone with access to all telephony components](http://osnews.com/story.php/27416/The_second_operating_system_hiding_in_every_mobile_phone), and you're a fool if you think Apple has a way of controlling that."
"Also [this defense conference from 2010](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQqv0v14KKY), which still contain valid exploits using this secondary operating system that can't really be patched if you're controlling the towers:"
"It doesn't matter how tightly Apple/Google/Microsoft closes the lid on their OS, if they have access to a cell phone tower, there are *decades* worth of bugs in the software used to make these devices talk to towers. Additionally, you should probably be a little skeptical of a company *advertising itself* as being pro-consumer, pro-privacy, while handing you closed source encryption implementations. "
"This fine is because the NSA and their ilk want to make it *easier* to get access to your data, not make it possible. You're a fool if you think closed source software is safe from interception. Apple is the largest company in America right now, stop kidding yourself if you can't see through their pro-privacy greenwashing."
"If you want tech privacy, you have to use open technology, and as long as the FCC/ITU controls the radio spec, that's not going to happen. I'm this sounds like a bullshit PR stunt. They pipe communications directly to they NSA. How do we take them seriously?> They pipe communications directly to they NSA"
"[Citation Needed]"
"Apple finally decides to innovateEveryone should know that Apple will, sooner or later, lose this one. They either go out of business or comply - it's that simple when you're up against the US government."
"It's time to start supporting alternatives that have no centralised control and, hence, don't have an organisation to be strong-armed into compliance."
"Edit: this doesn't mean ditching your beloved iPhones but merely installing and using a different instant message app./r/darknetplan Interesting."
"I would have assumed that Tim Cook loved letting dudes access his back door."
"God damn it, I don't want to like Apple.ZDNet reports that..."
"Stopped reading right there.When FCC demanded less backdoors, I said possibly strongly disagreed by the NSA. Is now the appropriate moment for me to say I said it so?[deleted]Because there is a difference between tax evasion and tax avoidance... Would you like to give the government the power to force you to pay more tax than you legally owe?Think of the fines as a marketing expense. Apple will get so much positive press for this. I guess that $200 billion in cash is finally getting some usage. They'll come down harder on Apple for this than they ever have on oil companies and banks when they destroy the environment and economy."
"That said, this all still feels like a big PR stunt to me anyway.Its not like they pay taxes or anything. Im sure they wont be bothered by it.America is a criminal. If you think the US government can't get into your iPhone, you're very misguided.Getting in is the easy part. Breaking the encryption of over the air traffic like imessages is a whole different thing. So how secure is Linux then? Can we assume they have provided backdoor access like Microsoft and google?Can we even trust that this is true, and not some joint marketing effort?To really fuck with companies and shit, we should all get together and crowdsource a defense fund for Apple just for this case."
"Oh, we got money from reddit for defending personal freedoms?"
"We should do that again!"
"No amount of money will stop a secret ruling in a secret court demanding a secret backdoor, with a hammer waiting over the head of anyone who makes it not a secret.Tizen OS is something Samsung developed to try to get away from Google. Than we come onto personal computers where China made Ubuntu (developed by [Canonical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_%28company%29)) it's official OS to get away from Microsoft and now 10% of PCs shipped globally now run Ubuntu mostly thanks to that. "
"_______"
"Countries and companies are already taking steps away from American software.   We in the west just don't notice it because it's taking place in the east.Sorry I call BS, PR stunt from Apple, no way the NSA doesn't have a backdoor into any smart phone in existence. Its a huge money maker for large corporations.You obviously must not be a software developer, especially not involved in anything related to servers or communication. It's not some secret underground where everyone has back doors like The Net. No I'm not a software developer, I'm a Sr Software Engineer and I know how easy it is to put in undocumented code into an API. government to Apple hey guys lets make it look like we don't have back door'sIn case you did not already know, this is just PR.Already a back door. This is just to get you upset. Remember that bogus, borderline honeypot story circulating a couple years ago about iMessage being uncrackable by the authorities?"
"This kind of smells the same to me."
"Apple isn't protecting a shooter's iPhone data. They're defending digital privacy | As CEO Tim Cook's open letter to customers stating that Apple would oppose the order points out, the request 'has implications far beyond the legal case at hand'It's called setting a precedent, and complying with the order at a time which is arguably still at an infancy phase for global cloud based technology would set a very dangerous precedent that could have far reaching implications for decades to come."
"I'm also upset at the tragedy that took place, but we can not use tragedy to allow the ends to justify the means.   We have to be better then that. Too bad the precedent is yeah we have a back door, but you can't have it. I would love if they kept iPhones secure all the time but the problem is that part of their pricing strategy means having a black market iPhone that is valuable too. Or we can suck it up and find out information to prevent more events such as thisIt's called protecting your bottom line. Apple is already on a downward trend, they need good publicity like this.What better way then piggybacking on some news like this. Funny how reddit loves pointing out  logical fallacies, but never learned the slippery slope oneThis is the very basis of trading freedom for safety. In the end, you are never truly safe so you sacrifice freedom for nothing.Tell that to the Patriot Act and it's extension!Set aside the precedent this sets for the technology, think about the precedent this sets for the private individual."
"It ultimately comes down to one simple question. "
"How far can the government go to compel a third party that merely has an incidental relationship (manufacturer of the phone) with the suspect in supporting an investigation? "
"It's one thing to ask for a warrant for meta data, or hell any data that Apple might have on it's severs as it pertains to the investigation. It's quite another to ask to them to construct an operating system so they can brute force the password."
"Think of the implications for the private citizen, if you had any kind of interaction with a suspect at any point in time, no matter how minor, you would now be forced to comply with any order forcing you to act as an instrument of government. This is so far removed from merely ordering a witness of a crime to testify."
"In a perfect world yes it would only be this 1 phone this one time. But that's not the world we live in, this would simply set the precedent that any government, federal, state, local, foreign can compel a private person or business, no matter how many degrees of separation, to act in any way that aides their investigation. That's an awful precedent to set and good on Apple for fighting this.I read elsewhere that they have already unlocked 70 phones.  Anyone else know if this is legit?According to Shane Harris of the Daily Beast Apple has unlocked phones for authorities at least 70 times since 2008. Apple doesn't dispute this figure.) "
"http://thebea.st/1Q2ev17Like we did with 9/11, for example.> cloud based technology"
"They can already obtain lawful access to cloud-based data. This case is about data at rest in a particular end-user device.I'm referring to cloud technology and all the associated techniques including security which this includes both of.This has nothing to do with cloud technology, this is regarding whether or not law enforcement should be able to require backdoor access to offline data encrypted on a user's device. The entire concept of cloud technology is irrelevant to this conversation.Patriot ActThis whole thing is getting spun way out of control by all parties involved and as usual, tech journalism isn't helping at all."
"/u/soondot linked to the [actual court request](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/46f8p8/apple_isnt_protecting_a_shooters_iphone_data/d04qgtl), so I won't repost it, but people commenting should read it - it's not long and it's clear most haven't based on what they're posting. Basically they want a custom OS update that would allow them to bypass the incorrect password retry limit. The FBI can't make this custom OS themselves because it has to be signed by Apple for the phone to accept the update. The FBI has said the following would be acceptable:"
"* the software could be made to only work for that particular handset's hardware ID"
"* Apple doesn't have to give the FBI the software - Apple could install the software on Apple's premises and give the FBI access to try and brute force the password. Once they get the data the FBI doesn't want the software (per this court order at least)."
"Now, Apple is correct by saying that this software could easily be reused. It would likely be trivial to swap out hardware IDs in whatever Apple wrote so that's hardly a good defense for why it couldn't be reused. And the fact that *this* court order doesn't actually ask for the software doesn't mean the FBI couldn't get a court order later for the software. So that is also a concern."
"But the thing is to some degree the objections from Apple don't make a whole lot of sense. Apple claims that this exact method would not work on newer handsets - it only works for the specific model the terrorist had because it was an older phone that didn't have the secure enclave. So in theory the precedent this sets shouldn't really matter for very long - if Apple is telling the truth precedent or not on newer iPhones there is nothing they would be able to do to help the FBI brute force the phone. So to some degree there's a little bit of methink they doth protest too much - I wonder if newer phones offer suffer from a similar vulnerability (that you can load firmware signed by Apple onto the phone and it will perform the upgrade without the phone being unlocked via the user's passcode). They screwed up with the older models - the fact that this method would work (Apple has confirmed that it would) is a vulnerability. They allegedly fixed that by adding in the secure enclave, but it's possible they have now realized it could also be exploited in the same way, hence why they really, really don't want this precedent to be set. Because if their encryption really was bulletproof like they claim then precedent or not there's nothing they could do on the newer phones to help unlock them."
"I could see their other concern being that this sets a precedent for the government to be able to force companies to write software for the purposes of accessing something, and that means in theory they could force companies to put in vulnerabilities in the first place, but that (at least in my own opinion) seems like a bit of a stretch based on what is being asked for here and it so far has not really been the argument Apple has put forth.Switching the hardware ID isn't easy when you can't then sign your changed firmware.I kind of had the same reaction as you. I consider myself a strong proponent of encryption and security/privacy but this is a case of something Apple can do without compromising the greater iOS ecosystem (since they don't have to provide the software)."
"I mean sure someone can hack their source control servers and change the hardware ID to make a new iOS build that can be installed anywhere but under that assumption the attacker can make *any* change to iOS anyway since they are in Apple's system."
"In no way is FBI asking for a backdoor that can be installed anywhere else nor did they indicate they would like them to modify iOS devices to have back doors in the future."
"(I kind of feel that a lot of the people on the anti-gov side are sort of technical but haven't really fully thought about what's being asked here, hence the door backdoor being thrown around)> Apple claims that this exact method would not work on newer handsets - it only works for the specific model the terrorist had because it was an older phone that didn't have the secure enclave."
"The secure enclave can be updated via software, which means Apple has every reason to fight this now. Otherwise, once the precedent is set, courts would have no problem ordering them to write new custom OS updates in the future for law enforcement.Updating it via software is fine. Updating via software when the device is still locked is not. If you can do the latter, the device is not secure.Furthermore, the law enforcement is complaining that not being able to get into phones is impeding their job."
"If this were 10, 15, 20+ years ago before smart phone penetration, your job would be do to police work all the same. This just makes it easier for you, which is not necessarily unilaterally a good thing if history is evidence."
"Just because data is condensed into the phone doesn't mean you can't police your way into finding it out through, you know, detective work. Unless he's writing a diary on it, it's not generating data so much as it's storing communication history. Am I wrong?"
"I assume the FBI can use the carrier to get the texts/calls/metadata. What more do you need?"
"This also opens the door to foreign governments who aren't so discrete or surgical in law enforcement to start making demands on Apple/Google/etc.10, 15, 20+ years ago law enforcement could get a legally obtained search warrant to get to a place where they have enough reasonable proof that evidence exists."
"A lot of the slippery slope arguments that are used here would have not allowed search warrants to exist either because that is basically the same as letting law enforcement into your house whenever they want for no reason at all.>Unless he's writing a diary on it, it's not generating data so much as it's storing communication history. Am I wrong?"
"It's possibly recording GPS, *microphone, camera*, and other sensors. There's a lot of potential for abuse."
"You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole."
"You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole."
"They were playing recordings of a NY Police official on NPR complaining about the ~150 iPhones they have lying around which can't be accessed since Apple stepped up encryption. So, since September of 2014 there have been well less than a phone every other day that this type of backdoor would assist at a department in one of the busiest cities in the nation. Seems to me that is drops in the bucket compared to how many people in that jurisdiction are having their phones and data protected by the same software. We don't even know that all those phones would be useful.*Everything* impedes law enforcement these days. Miranda laws impede them, having to get a warrant signed impedes them, limitations on how long you can hold a suspect without cause impedes them, and the inability to track anyone they want anytime they want impedes them. If you can't do the job with the tools you've got, you're not the (wo)man for the job.I think there are some reasonable middle-grounds, I have not read any of what has been going on with the Apple information requests, because frankly everything I read nowadays makes my blood boil."
"But do you not think that some things could be changed to give police more access, but not infringe on our rights? I wouldn't want a backdoor in my phone. But what if my sister got kidnapped, and the police could get a warrant to access her phone? Under supervision, utilize her phone's gps to track them. I understand, with such access comes serious possible malice, and no one trusts the government, for good reason."
"Idk maybe I just wish things were different."
"Edit:I think most of my logic stems from the belief that hard criminals void their right to privacy, and I see digital goods the way I see hard goods. I think he doesn't deserve the right to privacy, but not at the risk of infringing on innocents' rights to privacy, if that helps clarify my clusterfuck of thoughts.That is the point: "
"Agencies that overreach do not get punished. they do not even get budgets slashed. "
"If you could guarantee that every time the agency that got the iphone hack tool used it without a signed warrant, their budget got slashed in half, I would be happier then a mug to grant it to them. I would be extatic. "
"But if there is no actual accountability for overreaches? No public apology? No We are sorry, here are some cat pictures?"
"Then fuck you. "
"Also, a sincere question: IF criminals void their right to privacy, would you agree that law breaking government institutions void their right to recieve funding? "
"And just for the record. If you are a criminal, then yes, I guess your right to privacy is dimished. "
"But if you are a cop, or member of a law enforcement agency, and your process of proving people are criminals is to ssume they are criminals anyways and use the rights established for usage after someone is proven to be a criminal to see if they are a criminal.... "
"Sorry, then I am of the opinion that the right to privacy has to be defended no matter what, because if private data even gets into the hands of law enforcement agencies they are going to loose it anyways. "
"Or, slightly shorter: "
"I have nothing to hide from people that I trust. I actually want to work in some sort of enforcement, I'm working on physique and health first, but I completely agree on the points about assuming someones a criminal, innocent until proven guilty is completely thrown out thanks to some."
"I have plenty to hide, not because I'm a bad person, but because we all have flaws."
"I agree completely that agencies should be held accountable, they infringe on rights, but get no repercussions, which pisses me off, the system is not played, it's manipulated.exactly... and unless we see change in this, if we can be assumed guilty untill proven otherwise, they should be assumed corrupt and incompetent untill proven otherwise. Until we unfuck the police and the govt, that cannot happen. > But do you not think that some things could be changed to give police more access, but not infringe on our rights?"
"Honestly, no. Appealing to emotional what-ifs is a media/government trick. It's not how laws are made or enforced, at least not in a world with any semblance of fairness."
"Hard criminals have already voided their rights to privacy. You're not talking about criminals, you're talking about suspects. In the case of the dead guy, he too has no right to privacy by virtue of being a corpse.What emotional tricks??? Enact Ashley's law today and never again will the police be prevented from accessing a kidnapped child's phone! /sWhat you propose exists - yes, we can track a network device, and as long as that tracking is locked up behind warrants (and *never* made available warrantless), we maintain a balance of privacy & police protection. But forcing a company to build a backdoor into a device sold to the consumer as private and secure... That's the type of thing that will not remain locked up behind warrants. Put a backdoor into a product and it will be abused, period. So it's all back to the backdoor again? Should have known.Forcing them to build it costs resources too. Even if the FBI compensated apple for the production of such a product, that's still consumes apple's engineers and disrupts their road map. Not saying the fbi is doing this currently, but in the future this could be used as leverage against companies to strong arm them out of doing something the government decides it doesn't likeThe problem with what you're saying is you are accusing them of being criminals before you've even proven it. That is how you get innocent peoples rights taken away because They're a terrorist or whatever.Bunch of winy pussies, what happened to classic detective work? Almost like someone meant for it to be that wayLet's get rid of the impedance and create a force of judicial police officers with execution privileges. Damn it.. now I want to watch Dredd.I AM the law!LAAAAHHHHWWWWWWWWW!Yeah. It's a Stallone and Schneider kind of day. Hellooooo, Cursed earth pizzaI prefer the Urban versionSo police officersAw shit, you're rightI feel like this is turning into a political firestorm and everyone is going to staunchly defend their viewpoint. It seems to be creating more and more divide amongst the American people"
"But honestly I'm surprised there are even people defending the government on this one. It really is amazing to see the state of this country in 2016Off topic but you helped me decide the name for [my app I'm working on](http://imgur.com/96VRW07). Just wanted to give you some credit. "
"What's the app about?About the quest of a family friendly cactus >But honestly I'm surprised there are even people defending the government on this one. "
"Why? Apple can unlock the device without risking the unclock of other iphones by creating a firmware for this exact phone only. "
"There is no slippery slope. "
"It's not really any different than a landlord breaking the lock to allow a search. "
"The government is specifically not requesting a general backdoor. Nor is it saying apple has to make sure that apple can unlock phones in the future. The problem is apple didn't properly secure the phone and apple still has the ability to break the encryption. Next time apple should make it truly secure. "
"There is a wide divide indeed.  Informed vs ignorant, idealist vs realist and intelligent vs well... stupid:/"
"And there is a increasingly wider divide between those groups.My biggest concern is that these are our own countrymen. These are our neighbors, their relatives and children. It's like we're battling against each other to try to help the ignorant not sell us all down the river.There is no quick fix.  This problem started a long time ago and took two generations to get where is is now. It will take at least that long to fix and that's only if major changes are made this minute."
"When educating our children lost priority as a principle and became about saving money we were doomed to a regressive future.  Welcome to that future.[You can say that again](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35595840), and it's not even in the USA."
"(The qualification for being given a platform to speak appears to be relative of person killed in terrorist attack).It's kind of interesting that people like Sen. Feinstein are now on the same side of this issue as Fox News and Donald Trump (i.e. government) vs. the epitome of the private sector (Apple).It's almost as if they want to divide and conquer.There are people who will defend the PATRIOT act. It's terrible because those of us who recognize what's going on are marginalized, even though the numbers are growing. It's like the country is completely split and we're all in this weird Mexican standoff that we all pretend isn't happening."
"This certainly is not the highest point in American history. Remember, the government is made of people too. If a person dreamed it up, other people supported it, its now a thing and here we are. People are people. There will always be them vs us mentalities. . .sadlyPeople really need to learn how it works from a technical standpoint.So much this.  To me the crux of the issue is the ignorance of the technical implications.  Hell maybe telling people in terms of nude pics that were hijacked from Apple cloud a couple years ago.  "
"If people were outraged about J Laws nudes getting loose, imagine what would be unlocked if someone got a hold of this iOS backdoor.Actually, the FBI can easily get your icloud data. Easily. "
"This is about data that only exists on the phone. Apple is claiming they don't have to help because they don't have access to the data. There is no backdoor being created though. I understand the tech pretty well and basically they just want to brute force the passcode without being locked out. Backdoor implies a pre-installed shortcut to get around protections, which this isn't."
"The court order also allows the software to be installed in Apple's facilities so it's not like Apple has to hand over the iOS build to the FBI. They just want the info."
"This also doesn't prevent the security minded to use a longer password than 6 digit passcode. This would make it impossible to brute force even by Apple."
"Also Apple has already handed over the iCloud data. It's not like they are against handing data over under court order.There is a backdoor, but it's already installed. The fact that Apple can actually change the firmware is a backdoor. It was a security flaw. Nevertheless the flaw was not there because of the FBI and more because older iPhones didn't have the secure enclaves in the design (https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf). It's also been fixed in later iPhones (anything with A7 or later)."
"Also 6 digit passcodes are by nature really easy to hack, even with iterative hashing since there are only 10000 combinations. There's really nothing you can do about that other than preventing a new firmware to be installed on existing iPhones without unlocking (which as mentioned should be impossible in later phones). E.g. if you had an longer alphanumeric password it would be impossible for Apple to crack it in reasonable times, i.e. no real encryption backdoor."
"It's sad to me, the willingness to open up your life and give up any rights because they cower in fear of a boogeyman.I don't mind people that are willing to open up their own lives.  I have a problem with them wanting to open up other people's lives.  Like so many issues with society, the problem isn't people wanting to live the way they want to live, it's that they want other people to be forced to live the way they want to live.My main worry is that if they make it so that some of our alphabet agencies can get in why can't anyone else do the same thing. That's the worry of many of usLand of the free*"
"Home of the brave*That's how many pro-gun activists have felt about the last few decades. It's not a fight that's going to end on any fronts soon, or easily. The if you have nothing to fear argument is insidious in its simplicity. It takes a bit of thinking to realize that there are plenty of normal things people do where privacy is justified. Starting a business? Your competitive advantage might not be something people are paying attention to and thus should be kept quiet. At the end of the day, as long as you are not inhibiting someone else's freedoms, you should be able to use your discretion to act, and not have to worry about intervention from your government or your peers.What if you don't want you identity stolen?It's actually a bit pathetic that that they are exploiting this case to push the agenda of backdoors into encryption.  Well since the FBI is a law enforcement agency and they are seeking a way to get data off this cell phone and Apple is denying this, they are in fact protecting this shooter, as well as future shooters the FBI will no doubt like to investigate. How terrible would it be for the FBI to have more resources to do their job.> they are seeking a way to get data off this cell phone and Apple is denying this"
"No, Apple is denying them access to a custom written operating system designed solely to strip privacy away from their customers. There is a large difference and the FBI is WAY out of line here trying to force it."
"Denying law enforcement's illegal requests is not protecting shooters and you are incorrect to try to frame it that way. It's an appeal to emotion and proves how little you know about the actual situation since there's not even any real proof the cellphone holds unique data they can't gather elsewhere."
"This is just the FBI trying to overreach and not do the leg work to track down the information through other channels. They have access to more information than ever these days but if they don't have everything it's apparently not enough which is total bullshit.Who is they?Goku and Krillin, man, who else?How are they pushing *backdoor* into *encryption*?"
"Backdoor means a pre-installed shortcut for certain parties to get around protections. Given this is install post-encryption it's a hacking tool, not a backdoor."
"Also the attack is on the OS level protection not *encryption* itself. Apple is not asked to modify all future iOS devices to make them easier to crack (in fact on the current generation iPhones this attack isn't possible). Given they want to crack this via brute force it's not like they are bypassing the encryption. It just so happened that older iPhones have this vulnerability with simple pass codes and they are asked to exploit it."
"Being asked to exploit a known vulnerability is different from introducing back doors intentionally.Sadly, I've heard remarks against Apple horse hindering the case.  Our society is so short sighted in so many ways.It's sad how the govt and politicians exploit any tragedy for their own gain. The anti-gun folks do the same thing with mass shootings, anti-drug folks do it with major drug busts.. This isn't a new thing. Hell, the pro gun folks are starting to exploit mass shootings. If everyone had a gun pointed at everyone else all the time, this tragedy would not have happened, and we would all be safer.Weren't there literally dozens and dozens of unencrypted red flags they missed anyways?They did it immediately after a bunch of people were gunned down in cold blood in Paris. They didn't even wait to them to be buried before using it as [another excuse for backdoors.](http://www.wired.com/2015/11/paris-attacks-cia-director-john-brennan-what-he-gets-wrong-about-encryption-backdoors/)"
">US official explained to the Post that the government had not yet succeeded in persuading the public that encryption is a problem because [w]e do not have the perfect example where you have the dead child or a terrorist act to point to, and that's what people seem to claim you have to have."
"Inhuman scum.See, people? This is why we have conspiracy theories. And not nice things.Didn't it turn out that the Paris attackers didn't even use a secure messaging service? Standard SMS, wasn't it?Yep. Where's our ROI on all that massive national security apparatus we've built? Yep. Standard unencrypted SMS."
"Not PSN, like some news networks would have you think."
"Guys, it's all good. John McAfee is going to socially engineer his way into the phone with his team for free!I thought he was too busy having a ton of sex initiated by looks from his wife in any place and at any time.Sweet talking Siri doesn't work. I know the FBI, and the government more generally, doesn't give a flying fuck about privacy, but how can they still not see that crippling encryption will harm the US economically?I replied elsewhere but FBI isn't trying to get Apple to weaken their encryption though. This is on an older iPhone with a vulnerability that it can be brute forced and unlocked (if it has simple pass codes). It's not like Apple is asked to weaken security on all future iPhones."
"If anything this is a design flaw on the iPhone 5c and older phones."
"Not saying FBI/NSA hasn't tried to weaken encryption in other areas by introducing back doors to software but this isn't one of them.They can't care. In the same way that a burger flipper can't care about the obesity epidemic. The economic well being of the US doesn't matter to them so much as enforcing law. We can change them by changing the relevant laws. Right, I meant their masters, not the FBI themselves.Any Congress member who speaks out against this can have the challenge of X called off the FBI from investigating terrorism! levied at them during their next election cycle.The same way they didn't see milti-billion dollar bailouts & ZIRP policies would decimate the economy.In what world did the *bailouts* ruin the economy?  The economy was already on a spiral downward.  Just read /u/Dain42's comment.> milti-billion dollar bailouts [...] would decimate the economy"
"I'm no supporter of big banks, and I think we need much better, stronger, harsher financial regulation than we do."
"But without the bailouts and TARP, the economy most likely would have actually, literally been decimated. Letting the banks fail would have been fun and cathartic for *maybe* a few hours, but it would almost certainly have taken most or all of the global financial system along with it, and that would have been completely disastrous to everyone, from workers right on up. Our economy and our whole way of life that we're used to completely depends on the proper functioning of the financial system."
"If you want to get into some really good in-depth reporting, you should check out the series of shows *This American Life* did in collaboration with NPR over the course of about 3 years, all about the financial crash.

"I say gut em. I'd rather go back to the Stone Age then continue living in this corrupt Corporate America. Nice one. I know what I'm watching tonight.Thanks for this!  Never heard of either of those programs, took a look at their site and looks like good stuff.  Looking forward to checking these out.I'm quite happy to share! *This American Life* is one of my favorite shows on TV or radio, and it's one of the few podcasts where I actually usually sit down and devote my undivided attention. I've been listening for almost a decade, now. They don't only do serious journalism, but when they do, it tends to be absolutely superb. Like their [two](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/562/the-problem-we-all-live-with) part [episode](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/562/the-problem-we-all-live-with) about the current, *very* segregated state of our schools, and their Peabody Award winning episode about Guantanamo, [Habeas Schmabeas](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/310/habeas-schmabeas)."
"They do a lot of very personal stories about individual people, ideas, and experiences, too.

"I'll stop linking there, because I could go on and on, and I probably already got carried away.I don't think they really give a fuck about the bailouts. The same people who own the country are the ones who got paid after all.Yes indeedy, the american people own the country and we did get paid."

Oh wait, it did the opposite.I couldn't believe when I read some comments quoting Apple as harvesting/helping terrorism.  People saying they will never purchase another Apple product, etc..."
"Since when did citizens start demanding government access to personal data?  Citizens caught up in fear (again) to justify yet more freedoms taken away in the name of public safety.  It isn't enough the NSA records all phone messages and text messages, now users are lambasting Apple for standing up and saying enough is enough.> to justify yet more freedoms taken away in the name of public safety."
"For me, it's not even about that. Encryption is all or nothing. You CAN'T HAVE a backdoor because that would defeat the purpose of encryption completely. If a backdoor exists, people WILL find it. It's not a matter of if they find it but when. I have yet to read a single comment like the one you are talking about. All I have seen is people objecting to comments I can't seem to find... http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3450382/Judge-Apple-help-US-hack-San-Bernardino-killers-phone.html"
"Almost every commentI'm just waiting for all the old people to die. It really seems like the blind support for this shit is coming from a lot of people who don't know how the technology already works. If they really knew what the Patriot Act was all about (the name is a god damn insult) and especially how article 215 worked, I really don't think they would be so keen on letting these government agencies have free and unlimited access to our phone's data.It doesn't help that Donal Trump, who has a pretty fervent following, went on to say yesterday how bad it is for Apple to not assist law enforcement. From yesterday:"
"I think it's disgraceful that Apple is not helping on that.  I think security first and I feel -- I always felt security first.  Apple should absolutely -- we should force them to do it.  We should do whatever we have to do and I guess he wants to be a good liberal and he doesn't want to give the information. "
"But we -- on that -- as an example, those two people killed 14 people.  There were other people that saw the bombs laying all over the flu system (ph) like a normal apartment.  You had bombs laying all over the floor.  You had all sorts of ammunition.  You had all sorts of everything in that apartment. "
"People knew that.  I'd like to know who else knew it because they're almost as guilty and maybe just as guilty.  I think you have to be able to correct that and I think Apple is absolutely in the wrong.Using fear to take away liberties.  It is amazing how people forget this."
"How the fuck can people who claim to be conservative, be demanding a corporation violate our rights, in order to help the federal government?!"
"It's like we're living in bizarro world.>How the fuck can people who claim to be conservative, be demanding a corporation violate our rights, in order to help the federal government?!"
"Because there is no violation of anyone's rights. You have the freedom from unreasonable search and seizure. This phone was seized from a guy who went on a shooting rampage. The ability to search this phone is the most reasonable search you can even imagine. "
"There is no credible argument that searching this phone is an invasion of privacy. "
"There is some argument that forcing apple to defeat their own security is bad. I'd certainly be against forcing apple to break all their encryption. "
"But the court is asking Apple to break the encryption on one single device. A device the government has every right to search. "
"Apple is claiming this sets a bad precedent, but I just don't see it. It is strange that many people who claim to stand for small government would also say give them all the access they need to stop bad guys.It's been bizzaro world for quite some time now. What really baffles me is that some people out there believe that letting the government crack iPhone encryption will make us safer."
"The only way it could be argued that it **might** make anybody safer is if they preemptively snooped through your crap in an effort to figure out who's planning an attack. And even then you'd have to be a real idiot to think they'd be able to sort through that load of shit and come up with anything useful. Hell, the NSA certainly didn't stop the San Bernardino attack."
"I just don't understand how people are so willing to throw away their privacy. Even if the government was genuinely trying to protect us (who the fuck still believes that?), who the hell can possibly be OK with doing it that way?Think of the information that you *might* get from the phone of these people though? I bet the congressional hearing that starred the report would be a blockbuster.Lets argue the other way for them. "
"Would you be willing to hand this I-phone cracking tool to North korea? "
"Because they can as well produce an officially signed court order to ask them to help defend the countries security by installing a backdoor into iphones that forces the phone to open up. "
"So, by installing this for the US, apple would allow north korea, china, iran, irak, the french, russia and many others to point to the abailability of this kit and go, we can launch similar demands, from anything like the iranian moral police requesting apple to decrypt the phones of suspected unreligious western people to north koreans asking to have apple unencrypt the phones of suspected spies. "
"So, would you support the request of the US government if it means the chinese get the capability to read your phones contents if they find a judge who signs the warrent?When you release a backdoor 'kit', you can bet it will either fall into the hands of hackers to put up on the web and/or be reverse engineered to figure out how the backdoor works.Everyone knows how AES works, that doesn't mean you can break it. The same goes for backdoors. It depends on what kind of backdoor and how it is implemented. well, lets think of it like that: "
"As far as I understood it, all they want to have is have their code signed by apple. "
"So, my question is simple... how difficult is it to remove a key from a chain of trust? "
"Like, lets say, I am apple, and I want to sign your app candyland for exactly the 15 minutes that you say you need it signed. Can I create a special key for it that only works for 15 minutes, and after that never more? "
"Because as far as I remember, with certificate authorities and the likes, it seems to be able to remove certs from the hong kong post poffice from your servers, and such. Therefore, just asking : "
"did I understnd the question right? "
"Would my solution actually be practicable? "
"Could it be done in the way I described it?Yes something like that could be done, at least on the activation server level. Hell, not thrilled either, but I revolt against the presumption that this can not be done one time and securely. All you have to do is use game theory. "
"for example: "
"Say the police department wants to decrypt phone A. "
"Now, with a signed warrent, The police department goes to the agency, that uses all of the old zero days. "
"It picks out a zero da, and demonstrates it to the apple lawyer team. "
"After the apple team has verified that it is a zero day, They give their shit to it. "
"The passcode for the one time usage of the server with the decryption program? The fix ID for the bug, plus the warrent number. "
"This way, the FBI / NSA / CIA helps apple out and gets rid of their zero days, of which they have too much, but only a limited number. Apple in turn gets more secure for each zero day they change in. Plus, if you post the used passcodes to the system, after the harddrive has been whiped, you both have a way of publically announcing how many zero days have gotten rid off, and how much snooping the government does. "
"Result? "
"- it is guaranteed that apple phones get less bugs ( after all, if the givernment has to use up a zero day for every phone unlock, it gets pricey very quick, and I trust the apple engineers to be able to fix zero days that are known to them)"
"- it keeps the FBI/NSA/ect in check. "
"- it gives the decryption requests an opportunity cost, that makes it very hard for anyone to abuse their shit too much. "
"I mean, heck, what you are looking for is an encrypted one time connection, with an ideally one time passwoird, that allows them to brute force the phone open. Plus, the same judges that will sign Our three letter agencies must have the abilitioes to decrypt the phones will also sign people and companies helping the LEO's should get compensation"
"yes all certs are issued with a Not After/Not before expiry but you are at the mercy of that application to honor the expiry.  Many services have a ignore expiry on certs... That also seems to be a big concern in Tim Cook's open letter. Security through obscurity is certainly not the way to go (and large tech companies never rely on that), but you still don't want to help people figure out how to break into your OS by giving them examples.I have nothing to hide.I used to be like that. It's so fucking creepy now that I think about it. I don't need strangers knowing all this stuff about me.That triggers me so bad I wanna down vote your comment, but Don't shoot the messenger.That one makes my blood boil.> Since when did citizens start demanding government access to personal data?"
"*Subpoena duces tecum* likely go back to the Roman legal system. *Writs of mandamus* may only go back to Edward II, but in the US, such capability was put into law in the first session of the first Congress, because it was believed to be an important tool for a functioning justice system.Wouldn't it be funny if after all this the passcode was just 1-2-3-4.1-2-3-4^^-5?! that's what I have on my luggage. Have those people even read and made an attempt to understand what Tim Cook tried to explain? Apple can't provide that solution for the one phone. If they provide it, it has the potential of being used on **any** iPhone, and you'd have to be really gullible to think that they'll use it only for the one iPhone."
"Once a software solution is out there to crack that phone, it can and will be applied any time they want to look at the encrypted data on an iPhone."
"I'm sick and tired of the think of the children! type of argument that's constantly used by people who don't see any problems with the lost of liberties and privacy. Anybody who really argues that Apple should give the FBI what they're asking for clearly doesn't have enough of a grasp on the situation to understand what it entails and shouldn't be allowed to make decisions for themselves.Actually... side check....

"Lets say apple signs the iphone version with a special key that is valid for only 10 minutes, then the key gets taken out of the chain of trust? "
"Hell, if you want to, have only one server host the special key, and have only one PC be able to connect to that server. "
"As soon as two or more PC's connect, the server removes itself from apples chain of trust, and revokes the certifficate. Then, the server gets taken out, and gets smashed, and what not. "

"Would that be able to guarantee that this would only be one time?>Lets say apple signs the iphone version with a special key that is valid for only 10 minutes, then the key gets taken out of the chain of trust?"
"How do you suggest the key gets removed? If someone captures it while it's on the wire then you might have a vulnerability to replay attacks. If it's dependent on the system clock of the device then that is not too hard to spoof if you have physical access and an accurate board diagram."
"The current protection relies on the data being total gibberish until it's combined with the correct modifications that turn it into useful data. Once that modification is done, there isn't really a good way to prevent it from being done again. Quantum cryptography is able to create keys which are destroyed by nature of using them but that's using some funky physics which aren't applicable here."

"The stingray, for example, had been used for years by local police and any suspects who got nabbed by it had no recourse to legally challenge it because there was no visible evidence of its use despite literally being a radio tower. "
"Why do you think they would handle software any more responsibly when it's even harder to get caught using it illegally?I'm guessing that if Apple had *any* way to comply with the FBI without compromising the rest of their products, they'd do it. Publicly taking on the FBI in the privacy v security debate scores Apple points here on Reddit, but it could seriously hurt in the business world. No, Apple's doing this because there's no other way, I believe. And I commend them for it.The real problem is how major news outlets are reporting it. CNN, ABC World News, and our local news station all had reported how Apple is putting us at risk by protecting terrorists privacy, and placing their needs and rights above ours. "
"The actual story of what happened was never reported. There was no mention of how our Government asked for what could basically be our undoing in terms of digital privacy. They have all made it seem like Apple and Tim Cook don't want to cooperate with the FBI. They did, and they had provided them with the data needed for the investigation. What they didn't do is fulfill their requests to make a virtual master key for their products so that our data is available o anyone and everyone who has access to it. "
"As an apple customer, I'm very pleased with Tim's decision to oppose this kind of action. They are going toe to toe with one of the biggest and most powerful entities in the world, and it's certainly not easy to be in the position they are in now. I'm glad that my rights to privacy are respected by somebody, when I that they won't be by my own government. Why can't the FBI send apple the Phone with a search warrant. Apple will then unlock it and send the FBI its contents. Straightforward, no? That's literally what the FBI asked for.No, the simple answer is 'no.' It's not straightforward and Apple cannot just 'unlock it and send' it back. Apple purposefully designed it so that it's outside of their own access.Because Apple can't unlock it. They'd have to build something first."
"Apple can only really provide data from iCloud - but anything on your device is secure. > Because Apple can't unlock it. They'd have to build something first."
"So in other words...they *can* unlock it. "
"I think his question was, why can't Apple simply access disclose the data on that phone? Why does the FBI need to capability the open each and every iPhone when all they need in this instance is the data from a single phone?> So in other words...they can unlock it."
"They *cannot* unlock it with current technology. They'd need to develop a new product to try to unlock it. Not even Apple has the ability to do this. There are systems in place on the phone that would need to be dismantled via a master key, and that means that Apple would need to break encryption for all phones. Encryption is math and making a hole for one group means leaving that hole for everyone. No, they can't unlock it. They can potentially unlock it in the future by creating a weakened version of their own product. Apple is worried that doing so will enable nefarious misuses of this weakened version in the future, and that it will set a bad precedent for future counterterrorism activities.    ios-update.sh /dev/ttyS2 ~/cracked-ios/build/main.bin"

"See also the [Fourth Estate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Estate).I was disappointed this morning when NPR interviewed a former government security analyst who kept deriding Apple and they offered no counterpoint. Absolutely no understanding of how encryption works or how software development works. Let's how that journalist feels if weak encryptions caused his messages and photos to be leaked to the public This whole encryption discussion in the media that's been happening for the last few months is both super hilarious and scary. A bunch of old people who don't have a clue about encryption who think that it's possible to weaken it so that the good guys can access data while simultaneously keeping the same level of safety against the bad guys."
"Not sure what else I was expecting, coming from people who think describing the Internet as a series of tubes that sometimes get clogged is a good analogy.There is an unfortunate number of both liberals and conservatives who are entirely for giving up privacy on the internet and digital devices. This is coupled with mainstream news outlets becoming cesspools of bias and pandering.

Did they try swipe right then down?A backdoor will put ALL iphone users at risk. Can someone explain what the difference from them searching a home with a warrant and unlocking your phone to look at info is without devolving it to an ethics concern?Tim Cook says it all in his open letter. Providing a solution like what the FBI wants for this particular case **cannot** be done as a one-time thing. Once the solution exists, it exists. It can and will (you'd have to be naive) be used on other phones. You'd have to be naive to think it won't be abused."
"The search warrant for a home equivalent would be to say that every door is locked and indestructible and the only way the FBI can get into a home is with a search warrant. Except in this case, if you emit one search warrant for the FBI for a particular home, it also gives them access to every home in the future without a search warrant. They can swear they'll only open doors when they have search warrants, but a lot of people (including me) call bullshit."
"The search warrant for a home isn't a very good analogy because to make it the equivalent of what they want to do with Apple you have to set a bunch of parameters (ie: access to every door without a warrant) in a way that doesn't make sense in the real world.This was the ethics concern I meant.  :p  They can search homes without a warrant now.  Not legally of course, but they can and do.  So how would searching a phone (which should and does require a warrant) be much different?Because police already know how to knock down doors, but not break open iPhones. Let's not give them that.I guess it wouldn't be too different. But in this case it's still preventable because the solution the FBI wants Apple to create doesn't exist yet. It comes down to how would this be any more evil than that other evil thing we do that already exists?. We can't stop them from conducting searches of our homes without warrants, but we can still prevent the tool that would allow them to do the same thing for our phones from being created.> So how would searching a phone (which should and does require a warranty) be much different?"
"Because as of right now they cant abuse this the way that you suggested they abuse physical searches.  Once they have the key they can.  This is forcing the businesses that produce the locks to your house, to give the FBI a master key. The main issue is that they aren't simply wanting access to the device, they want Apple to build them a custom operating system that will allow them to access ANY Apple device by bypassing a lot of the most important security measures."
"This special version of the OS will remove the time-out and lock-out that occurs when the incorrect passcode has been entered too many times, this is one of the most important security features of the iPhone and without it the encryption is all but meaningless."
"Without this lock-out period and without the device being disabled with too many incorrect inputs the FBI will be able to brute-force ANY passcode on ANY Apple device by systematically going through ALL passcodes because they will no longer be locked out from the device due to incorrect inputs."
"This is the sort of tool that we see at first being used correctly then it is used for more trivial and trivial issues, as soon as you turn your back it's all of a sudden used at every opportunity by every local PD and law enforcement for anything as long as there is a cell phone nearby."
"Although they promise that it will only be used this once it's pretty obvious that if the government had this capability they certainly wouldn't let it go, you just have to look at the Patriot Act and how it's being completely twisted into a tool where the government can do whatever they want."
"It's a VERY dangerous precedent to set.And they (FBI), and a lot of reverse engineers could do this in a week. The asking Apple to do it for them is odd. If my life depended on breaking a 4 digit pass code that is the key to encryption on a16gb NAND flash drive soldered to a board, I think I could probably get it cracked in a few weeks. Desoldering it without damage and finding a compatible controller would be the tough part."
"That or pay SK Hynix in South Korea who built the flash drive to do it for me."
"Anyone else wondering if this is a feint? Maybe LE just wants the world to think they can't get into this.> If my life depended on breaking a 4 digit pass code that is the key to encryption on a16gb NAND flash drive soldered to a board, I think I could probably get it cracked in a few weeks."
"You would die.It's because they don't care about this specific device -- they want the precedent set for the future. They're taking advantage of the case and the timing and the current political climate to gain additional power.Nope and nope."
"The firmware won't run unless signed by Apple."
"You have to brute force the passcode on the device itself due to the hardware based key that is almost impossible to extract> Without this lock-out period and without the device being disabled with too many incorrect inputs the FBI will be able to brute-force ANY passcode on ANY Apple device by systematically going through ALL passcodes because they will no longer be locked out from the device due to incorrect inputs.  "
"I mean... if you wanted to brute force, you have the hardware; just desolder the chip from the phone, make duplicate copies of the data that is on it and throw a bunch of computers at the data."
"Getting data off memory chips is not exactly a black art, but the encrypted data contained therein could technically be brute forced without the need for a the user pin code.  I don't know how this would be construed in the court of law though since you are disassembling the device and it could be argued that what you are doing corrupted the evidence.>they want Apple to build them a custom operating system that will allow them to access ANY Apple device by bypassing a lot of the most important security measures."
"Negative. Their court filing even specifies that they just want help with this one device. They provide stipulations so that Apple may sign the software thusly. "

"EDIT: Why are facts being downvoted? The post I replied to said access to ANY Apple device. The FBI hasn't asked for that, and this specific ask wouldn't apply to anything other than the 5C. Once this software is written, it will be able to bypass any Apple device by nature of how it works. There isn't a way to create the software to only work for one specific iPhone since the binary is signed with a common private key. The first bootloader section checks that the next is signed correctly and then loads it, the loaded section does the same for a few more stages until you get all the way to the iOS kernel but the signing key is the same for different devices."
"If each binary was signed with a different key per device then this is something that could technically be possible but it would also prevent you from being able to restore your iPhone from any iOS installation image that isn't linked to your device. This is not how the system currently works so it's a moot point anyway but that's the reasoning why."

"Perhaps. I imagine if I was the FBI would have a search warrant for my phone and I was, for whatever reason, unable to be compelled to present the passcode. Like being dead. Which would make the whole effort seem reasonable. Just like now. With the dangerous precedent set in that they are able to order manufacturers to do such a thing do you seriously think it will stop at one device?"

"He turned off iCould syncing a month before the attack took place, so the FBI doesn't have backups to access instead. Syed Farook can't provide the passcode to the phone because he's dead. San Bernardino can't unlock the phone. The whole thing seems incredibly reasonable to me. There is a very good reason for the FBI to have access to the phone. "
"The entire thing, to me, seems like Apple's attempt at getting out of the business of unlocking iPhones. They've been denying the bereaved for years. "

The issue is you're not taking away the criminals privacy, you're taking away everyone's. We'd be one step closer to 1985 So wait...they've done it before but *now* they're taking a stand?Interestingly enough, I have not actually seen ANYBODY claim that Apple is defending the shooter. In fairness, I have to admit, I tend not to read the news sources that would be most likely to make that claim though.Is code not a form of speech?   How is requiring Apple to write something against their will not a violation of the 1st amendment?I fucking *hate* Apple with every fiber of my being because of their dated hardware and how they phase products out."
"But this, this right here is how you're supposed to do things.> They are defending digital privacy."
"OK. But most of all THEY ARE DEFENDING THEIR PRODUCT AND THEIR MARKET. Why did they previously unlock phones 70 times?!!I have a technical question about the nature of what the FBI wants.  On NPR this morning they suggested that the FBI wanted Apple to deactivate the retry counter, essentially letting the FBI try as many passwords as they want.  If this is true, then they aren't asking for apple to break the encryption.  Anyone know if this is correct?Comes down to the same thing. If they provide a way of disabling the password attempt counter for that phone, then they potentially provide it for any phone in the future. If you can brute force a phone in a few seconds, the result is the exact same thing, even if the encryption is technically not broken.True, but the difference is that the damage is not as far reaching.  It won't affect your online banking security, for example.Not sure I follow what you're saying."
"If apple just breaks encryption on their phone so that it can eventually be decrypted by the FBI (or another third party with the right tools), they get access to the encrypted data on your phone. If Apple provides a way to brute-force the password and access the encrypted data on the phone through the user interface, they get access the same way the owner of the phone would access the data."
"I'm not sure how either one of these options compromises online banking security."
"We're not talking about messing with the way iOS implements TLS or any of that stuff. the FBI wants a way to access the data on the phone, not a way to decrypt HTTPS traffic...They are asking Apple to write a version of iOS that will allow them to brute force the phone and then force-update that phone to that version of iOS.  So they can then, brute force it.That's different than asking Apple to break encryption which is what I thought it was.  Encryption doesn't rely on retry locks to work but it does rely on good (preferably  long) passwords or you are susceptible to a brute force attack.  They are asking for a secondary feature to be deactivated.  I'm still siding with Apple because of the precedent issue but I think it's important to be clear about what the discussion is about and I think the media hasn't been doing a good job there.>That's different than asking Apple to break encryption "
"You're arguing meaningless semantics. They are giving the FBI the means to break the encryption for all iPhones by bypassing security features. Most people would refer to that as simply breaking encryption because it makes the encryption next to worthless, or broken.This allows them to instantly break into the phone of everyone who uses, say, a 4 digit passcode. That's still a lot of people.well if they physically have your phone right?The specific software required from apple should they comply requires the ability to brute force via wifi too, but presumably it still needs to be installed on your phone. That being said, what's stopping it from being installed on your phone over the internet - it'd be an Apple-signed firmware update, the phone would accept it.The FBI wants a new OS that would load onto the phone without wiping it, and that would remove the retry counter so that they could use a brute force attack. See the text of the court order here: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2714001-SB-Shooter-Order-Compelling-Apple-Asst-iPhone.htmlIndeed. This could then be used on any device. Not just that one. Basically they're asking for the ability to break the encryption, not remove it entirely. The encryption is tied to a device-unique code and the passcode. The phone locks you out after a few incorrect guesses. It's impossible to get that data without this passcode; brute force will get them the code eventually, but they're asking Apple to rewrite the OS to allow them to brute force without locking them out. "
"Either way, they're asking for the ability to make a nigh-on-entirely secure device vulnerable. Which has much broader implications than law enforcement, including increasing the possibility of the scary evil terrorists of being able to break into U.S. Citizens' devices from absolute zero to not zero."
"If everyone realized this, this wouldn't even be a debate.Well if we treat a phone like another piece of property like a house, law enforcement doesn't give up searching your home when the doors locked. I have no issue with them breaking down your door if they have a warrant."
">  I have no issue with them breaking down your door if they have a warrant."
"Would you have an issue with the government forcing the home builder to install a new entrance?"
"The FBI can do whatever it wants to the shooters phone. Nobody has a problem with that."
"What I have a problem with is the FBI ordering Apple to build a new operating system with weakened security. I don't believe they have the authority to do that. Except even a house isn't a piece of property. Different rules apply to searching your car, your house or your personal belongings dependent on if they are in your possession or not."
"I'd be inclined to set a precedent where a phone's data isn't property but that's a whole other argument.I really like that point, honestly. The only issue I have it's it's a lot easier to sneak into a phone than a house without causing a scene. It's not quite the same thing, though. "
"Let's use an example of the police searching a home and finding a locked safe. Yes, they could attempt to break into the safe, pick the lock, cut it open with a blowtorch, etc. "
"But let's say that safe has a self-destruct mechanism of some kind. Cut it with a torch and the contents are destroyed. Pick the lock, the contents are destroyed, etc. "
"What the FBI is asking Apple for would be the equivalent of going to the Safe manufacture and asking for a master key. When the manufacture says Oh, we don't have a master key, that's the whole point., the FBI then says Ok, fine, then we want you to spend time and resources to BUILD a master key that will open this safe, even though one doesn't exist now. "
"So, the government is attempting to compel a private corporation to build a thing that doesn't exist (and it doesn't exist because it can't exist, otherwise it would make the safe rather pointless). Even if *this time*, the master key doesn't get abused, the fact that there's a precedent for compelling a private company to build something that doesn't exist is bad. I'd just like to let you know that you have the most informative post in this thread. I understand the issue now. There's a lot of oh the gov is taking our freedom away! Without any real understanding of how or why.> Oh, we don't have a master key, that's the whole point., the FBI then says Ok, fine, then we want you to spend time and resources to BUILD a master key that will open this safe, even though one doesn't exist no"
"Don't forget the we won't ever use it on another device or let some incompetent make a copy to sell, pinky swear teehee bit. "
"i don't get it, hasn't Apple been closely working alongside law enforcement for years? Law enforcement has never demanded that Apple build a new version of iOS that removes a security feature before. you know, there was another thing that affected our privacy in the name of terrorism"
"you know it as the patriot act"
"or more recently, NDAA.  this shit has to stop, it's nothing more than an excuse to spy on innocent people.I'm going to say this yet again."
"The whole argument/debate/what have you is moot. Anyone with a week or two in any basic programming class or learning about programming can learn how to make a program to encrypt or obfuscate stuff."
"Do what you want, but it will quickly become an underground thing that everyone does. It will be completely unenforceable except as a tack on crime to other stuff.So can't they subpoena Apple for the contents of their email and apps?  Sounds like they are trying to get away with not also subpoenaing(sp?) Facebook and other sites for info and getting in with a devise that has the passwords stored.  If they break into the phone, do they have legal right to use the info they get from the sites they can now access?  Not sure if the in plain view of a search warrant suffices.  The CIA and FBI couldn't even predict the obvious - 9/11.  Even I knew something was going to happen because I read the news and was familiar with the Hart/Rudman report.   These people allegedly have far better resources to garner their information from.  Why would the American people trust them with the encryption key to their personal data?  They've already breached our trust a thousand times over.Yeh, all I heard is Apple is siding with the terrorists. My new daddy and protector of all the bad stuff in the world 'Donald Trump' said so. I don't understand all that computer hippie liberal talk and therefor your opinions are wrong.The fact that this requires elaboration baffles me. Those boomers can't die soon enough. this argument is simple, if the fbi wants the keys to phones regarding the case, they should ask for keys to the phones regarding the case but you cant ask for the keys to every and any phone you wantwhats weird/funny Apple had previously released a statement, almost pre-emptively, outlining exactly why they wouldn't do it, and more importantly, Couldn't. I really hope Apple's lawyers point out the fact that Judges, lawyers, and the general public are NOT experts in this field in any way, shape, or form, and therefore can't force a security threat to be built. Because it's not just one phone... It would never be just one phone. The quote in the subject line sends chills through me because it's so god damn true and I'm afraid it's not going to matter.Has there ever been an instance in which the federal government forced a company to develop a new product (in this case, an OS) in order to execute a warrant?"
"That's the part that really gets to me. I don't see how a court can order a company to make something brand new. That's like saying when a judge throws out a case against a murder because the police found the evidence without a warrant, that the judge is protecting the murderer.  No they're not, they're protecting everyone else.I do not even understand the problem, here.  They could force the company to do it, I suppose, through something like a (laughable) threat to revoke their corporate charter, but how can they force the individuals that actually work at the company to do *anything* at all?"
"Are they going to jail the CEO somehow for not *requiring* it of his employees?"
"Have the CEO say okay, then every programmer can say I don't know how, or even simply no."
"Can they jail every programmer at the company?  That is insanity.  They have committed no crime and cannot be conscripted into forced labor by the FBI.  A simple I don't know how is not disprovable.  How would any prosecutor be able to hold them responsible, in any way, for Not creating something?"
"I mean, they can demand that I paint them a Rembrandt, but that doesn't mean I will and it doesn't mean that I could.  It is impossible to prove that I could, and Not painting them a Rembrandt cannot, in any sane world, be considered a crime.Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."

"I am glad Tim Cook is fighting this! Security is of paramount importance. If you create a back door... You create a vulnerability! And we do everything online now, including online banking. While I understand the concerns, I think overall security trumps the FBI's request!Why can't Apple theoretically unlock the phone on their premises and pass the information on to the FBI? Surely rather than giving the FBI unrestricted access to a back door why can't they do it on a case by case basis when a court order is presented?"
"Wouldn't this please everyone? Criminals can't hide but the rest of us need not fear."
"Unless of course the FBI do just want to snoop on whomever they please whenever they please.This will go all the way to Supreme Court. Kinda miss Scalia now even ~~thought~~ though he though I was intellectually inferior to others. it's a joke.  they aren't protecting your data but they need you to think they are...They are avoiding conflict with their current and future customers.  If they opened this phone, these people would stop trusting Apple with their information and would stop buying their products.  Social Justice?  More like protecting projected profits.  No they are getting free advertising.  Acting like the world is ending.  First, even if some program got out, it would only effect iphones.  Second, the government already has the power to tap your phones and conduct nuclear war but this apple program would just be too dangerous to have eh?  What a fucking farce.How are they defenders of digital privacy? Have they not been giving other access to data since 2012 to the PRISM program?Yea but why is Apple protecting a shooter's iPhone data? /sNo apple is try to protect their bottom line because they fear a poser backlash nothing more.They could do it this time, and then not do it again. That's something they definitely can do. Doing it one time doesn't mean they have to always do it. If the give the fbi the program or a phone with it, then the fbi won't ever need to ask apple again, they could just load it on any phone."
"That's the problem.It was really only a matter of time before encryption technology ran up against federal demands for access. As much as I would like to think that my phone's information cannot be accessed by anybody else, I don't have that right and neither does anyone else. I live in a society, not a deserted island and this is one of those situations where the rights of the many outweigh the rights of the few. This is no different than a judge demanding that a lock inventor open a patented lock on a vault. >This is no different than a judge demanding that a lock inventor open a patented lock on a vault."
"You are correct. A bunch of people with no technical expertise are crying about something they don't understand. Besides, Apple has admitted they can get into any iPhone. Why aren't these folks outraged about that?I respectfully disagree. We may live in a society, but part of our social contract with it is the right to dissent. That's why we gave ourselves certain rights that are not to be impinged upon despite the greater good. There are limits to them, but we should not bargain them away for safety so obligingly."
"As the saying goes, then we will deserve neither.This is completely different.  This isn't about Apple accessing one guy's phone. They don't have that capability. They're being asked to write software in which will circumvent their own security, and which will be able to unlock any phone.  It's like if the lock inventor was asked to create a tool that will unlock any of their locks, and hand it to the FBI, with the promise that they'll only use it once. Bullshit.  Ever heard of the TSA master key?  That thing is already leakedI never said it was about one person's phone. Like it or not, this was inevitable once the government really needs (or wants) to get in there. The company created a level of encryption that put the security in the hands of the phone's owner. It was inevitable that sooner or later, a case would arise where a phone owner would not be around to open it for the Feds. So the Feds are shouting that it's too much level of security and demanding Apple find a way to open the lock it created. Personally, I'm fine with it. They need to get into Farooq's phone. Will this spread? Probably. Overall, it's not a good idea to have places where the people who govern a state are wholly blocked from access with or without legal cause to do so. That's why warrants exist. Will there be abuse? Most assuredly. How do we stop that? That's an entirely different conversation.Get off your emo trip.  This has never been inevitable.  This is about."
"As for your earlier comment about I don't have that right, you do. It's your right to privacy, and your right against self-incrimination. And your right against unreasonable searches. The FBI doesn't have the right to demand this software, which is why we even know about it in the first placeIf you want to have a constitutional law argument with me, bring it. But I first expect you to have at least a marginal understanding of Constitutional law before we start."
"You grossly contradicted yourself. You said: *It's your right to privacy*, as if this is some unfettered right you carry. It's not. There are segments of the Constitution that provide for some protections, but there is no carte blanche protection of your privacy. This is a matter of governance, not a fight with your mom over her jurisdictions in your bedroom. "
"Then you say *right against unreasonable searches*. This one is correct. But do you know what it means? It means the state must first build probable cause to make a request of a judge who can then provide a warrant to search you and your property. This was provided by the FBI to the judge who laid the order on Apple. "
"*Right against self-incrimination*? By whom? Farooq? He's dead. San Bernardino County because it's their cellphone? They haven't complained about the FBI wanting access. Did you mean Apple? Apple isn't being called to expose itself to charges of Farooq's crime. "
"Now, given these basic principles of some of the Constitution, please explain why you think the FBI doesn't have the right to this software?"
"EDIT: A word.How is compelling Apple to modify their device a search? The FBI has the suspects phone, they are free to search it however they want. They can take it apart and examine it any way they want. They could unsolder the flash memory and make a copy if they wanted to. They could ask Apple for a copy of their source code, but I would say the source code isn't evidence of a crime.That's what makes this case so golden. This is going to be the biggest crucible of the Fourth I've ever seen. So far, though, Apple hasn't filed a claim deriding the judge's order based off the Fourth Amendment. We do know that the judge's assistance order is based off a search warrant so the Feds are definitely premising their request to the judge based off a search of the phone."
"I said it earlier and still think it will prove to be true: Apple took to the court of public opinion quite possibly out of concern that it can't legally fight the judge on this. Are you from the US? Because in the US, we have the 4th Amendment in our Constitution. So our society has decided that in this case, the rights of the few outweigh the rights of the many. I hope that we as a society continue to fight for that to remain as it is today.I am indeed from the U.S., and please don't misinterpret the Fourth Amendment. It's an important right. It's not some magical force-field. It prohibits *unreasonable* searches and seizures and requires the state to provide a warrant under judicial sanction supported by Probable Cause. Which is why the FBI went to the judge. Whether you like it or not, the Feds are playing by the book. Frankly, I wonder whether Apple is balking publicly because it is worried that it has little legal ground to stand on. It's a fascinating case.> This is no different than a judge demanding that a lock inventor open a patented lock on a vault."
"It's actually closer to demanding the inventor create a custom version of the locking mechanism that's cut away so it's easier to bypass and then replace the more secure version in the target safe. There's a lot more active involvement required than simply opening a patented lock which is why physical metaphor doesn't work so great."
">I live in a society, not a deserted island and this is one of those situations where the rights of the many outweigh the rights of the few."
"Yes, the rights of the many (the public) **to privacy and secure communication** outweigh the rights of the few (the government) to easy evidence gathering."
"The government isn't as blind in this case as they want to seem, they have lots of information available. The lack of access to one iPhone's memory will not make or break this case and really isn't a huge deal in the grand scheme of things so I find it very concerning how far they want to push things just to get access.You guys are fucking idiots. Whenever someone comes on here and talk about how companies need to do the right thing, you come back with that hard capitalist line saying that companies exist to make profits and they have no obligation outside of that. "
"Do you really think apple givers a shit about your privacy? No, they care about their image, and staying in business. The US government is there best tucking friend and all these fucking mice dancing to the pied pipers tune. What is really better for apple, actual security and pissing off the US government, or false security and the government backing you? You don't get too big too fail by not playing ball. Go on little mice, hop hop along to the bullshit circus. Also, go buy the newest iphone it's totally secure and apple loves you, Steve Jobs was Jesus.But they also don't want to be in the nanny business. There are plenty of ways to crack an iPhone without Apple helping you. There are people that would do it for kicks.  Once Apple cracks one iPhone, then Apple is in the iPhone cracking business... They sell tens of millions of phones... They can't open a whole division to crack them one-at-a-time ... And they REFUSE to put in a backdoor so any random police officer can do it... Because that wouldn't stay secret 5 minutes.I was getting my nails done last night and they had the local evening news on the TV, and I heard them mention something about coming up: Apple is refusing to help the FBI... and I'm just sitting there thinking Oh, fuck me... which way are they going with this?"
"I was glad to see that the story didn't outright paint Apple as bad guys."
"The story in question: http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2016/02/17/apple-to-fight-order-to-help-fbi-uunlock-shooters-iphone/"
"as well as their bank balanceInstead of installing a backdoor for all iPhone ever sold, why can't they just unlock specific phones of terrorist/suspects?  This just seems like a publicity stunt to me....because that's the same thing? having a way to gain access on a case by case basis would require a BACKDOOR  made available on any device that they were trying -or may want to try- to access. Unless you mean *individually cracking encryption on a case by case basis* in which case, the only problem would be time, and the issue of the sliding scale that determines what constitutes a terrorist...You remember the Patriot Act?"
"Ya know, that thing that said terrorists and suspects don't have the same due process or rights as the rest of us?"
"And then every branch of government started stretching the definition of the word terrorist to mean Human being?"
"Yeah.....Um no they are doing both. The shooters could easily be part of a larger cell and that's why they went though the trouble of encrypting their data."
"Maybe there is information on that phone about people planning to blow the heads off of kids at a day care next."
"So everyone has to decide weather they are willing to live with the possible consequences. Would you be willing to sacrifice your own child life to protect someone's phone data privacy. Because that's what it could come down to in real terms.Has anyone considered this might be a PR stunt?  Apple is not doing too well right now, and they are depending on China to be their next big market to satisfy.  If China thinks American governments can access their iPhone data, they may not be willing to let apple sell shit loads of phones there.>Apple is not going too well right now"
"What?"
"http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2016/01/26Apple-Reports-Record-First-Quarter-Results.htmlYes, but their stock value doesn't reflect that.  If China blocked them from selling, it would fall further.Surely this would be an exception? Pretty radical of Apple if you ask me. Surely you're fucking joking...?Lol, surely not mate. Sounds a bit silly to me.You're entitled to feel any way you want. Just be sure you at least try and understand the implications of what that would mean. Not sure if you're a US resident or not, but our rights here are fading fast. "
"There's no magical mystery on that phone that's going to uncover an entire treasure trove of data that's going to stop any future attacks. The dude's fucking dead, as he should be. I can certainly appreciate where you're coming from, I am from the UK but resided in the US for about 8 years. I admit I have no clue what's going on and can see the fact that it puts the citizens security at risk, but why is everyone so scared t hide from the government when surely they probably have an idea about who you are and why would they care about the every day citizen. I can see it might affect the people a bit higher up in society I suppose?The reason is because this tool would inevitably be used more than once. It would be disseminated to trusted parties. And the thing about software is that it *always* eventually makes its way to the internet. Once this happened, iPhone security would be shot on a widespread scale, and it would no longer be safe to do things like buying from Amazon on your phone without worrying that your personal data might be stolen. Anyone who got ahold of your phone would have access to everything on it."
"It's not an issue of whether we should allow an investigation to see one phone, it's an issue of whether we should *permanently* defeat the security that keeps us safe. It is akin to unlocking every door and safe that exists for the sake of looking in one.Innocent people are dead too."
"Also I like how you make an assumption that your rights are fading then assume there isn't anything on the phone that would help them.That's the thing. If you take time to understand how encryption works a bit and read the entirety of Cook's open letter, you'll understand that there's no one-time exception to be made here. It's all or nothing. Once the solution the FBI is asking for exists, it exists forever.There is no such thing as an exception in encryption. If an algorithm is broken it is useless. Kind of like an FBI forensic expert getting caught lying just once.The point is that they can't just make the key to unlock this phone. Once they make the code to unlock one, they can unlock any iPhone out there.This the point that most are missing .True, but I'm not sure how. Those of us on Apple's side have led our arguments with this fact. Repeatedly.B-b-b-b-but TERRORISTS!I would be totally and completely on the government's side if there was a possibility of Apple making a code to unlock it that couldn't be used again, but that's impossible.If Apple were to make an exception here, then the government will expect them to make an exception next time as well. And they will expect the same from other companies. And other governments will expect the same from their corporations and people."
"It's not about this one single iPhone, it's about the entire technology industry and the future of privacy. We have a right to privacy, even from our own government, and once we give in even a little, it will snowball into something much more sinister."
"What's that old Ben Franklin quote? Those who would give up liberty, for a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety. Has never been more accurate.I wonder how they would respond to a terrorist attack on an Apple store.It is sad that someone actually has to connect these dots for people.  Anyone who cant see this doesnt understand the bigger pictureIf there was a clear terrorist threat to the Apple company or Tim Cook personally that phone would have been unlocked in minutes and we would have never heard about it.Yeah but thats also a totally different scenario.They're doing both, terrorists are giddy now. We will never defeat this enemy unless we use their tactics.This is one reason the Israeli Mossad have a real bad reputation... They sank to the levels of the people they fight. You become the monster you are fighting when you sink to their level. In a world of absolutes you are right, thankfully we don't live in that world.Defending THEIR OWN digital privacy.Yeah, in order to protect our privacy, we need to protect the privacy of  terrorists.  Even if all parties confirm that the phone could yield valuable information.  "
"Its either this, or back to water boarding. [deleted]> corporate-backed digital-privacy astroturfing group"
"Are...are you referring to the EFF?! Holy shit, there's conspiracy and then there's that. The EFF is like the last group on the planet that would be involved is some false show.nope! https://twitter.com/yashalevine/status/700145684050276352I don't see anything wrong with those groups to be honest, or what they stand for."
"But for what it's worth the EFF staged a similar event at Apple Stores, and both the EFF and ACLU support Apple here. Honestly sounds like you're a little too conspiracy."
"https://twitter.com/EFF/status/700123835064983552"

"https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-comment-fbi-effort-force-apple-unlock-iphoneNaw man, not knocking the EFF or ACLU at all. Just that one particular group....I thought it was strange when I drove by the Apple store downtown and saw a group of people having a rally to support Apple...that's a huge departure from people lining up to throw rocks at the tech buses....how'd that happen? Popped onto twitter and saw it was organized by said group. The investor class has started getting more politically active here in the Bay, and part of that has been hiring people that ran dirty tricks in election campaigns to work for them, and part of that has been taking a page from the Koch-book and funding these 'grassroots' initiatives that have hidden, pro-company-x agendas. That scares me, as they obfuscate their funding & true agendas, and then a buncha people get behind the efforts thinking they're doing something good, while actually acting against their own interests. The fact that happens, and is happening with increasingly frequency, and that a lots of people really can't seem to differentiate, says to me we need to be much more mindful about asking questions, investigating movements, and not blindly throwing our support behind something just because there's an article about it in some publication that purports to tell us what we want to hear. We have to be increasingly critical & skeptical in these changing times.I fucking hate Apple and even I think what you just said is laughable.  The only good thing coming out of that company is their stance on encryption.You, sir, are an idiot. This doesn't have anything to do with Apple vs. anybody. This has to do with your private information and the role of encryption. It wouldn't matter if it were Apple, Google, or anyone else -- but since it's Apple that has to lead this fight, and is at least fighting for what (most of us) believe in, you need to drop your petty anti-Apple jealous fuckery and open your eyes to how fucking important this is.FBI has hacked into at least 70 phones we know abou. This is a PR move and Apple doesn't give a shit about our privacy[deleted]Try reading your own source next time.What they actually did (according to what I've read) is bypass the lock screen, which doesn't actually allow access to any of the encrypted data.  It's just that in older versions of iOS most of the data wasn't encrypted by default, whereas newer versions encrypt everything."
"It even *says* this in the article you linked.No you dumb sheep, they are defending their own ass so that they can not be prosecuted for both running a monopoly and tax fraud. What they're really probably doing is avoiding the government having them do some complex modifications every time they want to hack into a phone.They are avoiding creating backdoors in the security of their product that compromise the security of the phone against malicious actors.They are avoiding creating backdoors in the security of their product that compromise the security of the phone against malicious actors. If you create a hole in security for the FBI, it is only time before another hacker finds and exploit."
"Apple is worried Samsung won't make enough chips for the iPhone because the Galaxy S6 is suddenly doing better than expectedWouldn't Apple have a contract with Samsung to make x number of chips by a certain date?You can guarantee they do. Just like the company that provides Apple with sapphire crystal who didn't meet the expectations.Not to mention how much money Samsung is making off of Apple, they have a very strong incentive to not lose that contract. With this type of deal you would usually have a flexible contract. large amounts of the components in these chips are in so many other phones of today too. it was a while back, but i read that the ARM risc processors were in 70% of smart phones. This was before intel jumped in the game. They are also produced the world over by a lot of companies, if the supply from samsung dried up, they could pick the chips up elsewhere at a comparable price. Either way this story is bullshit, it just wouldn't pay for samsung to stop supplying them chips, they could restrict them or drive the price up due to demand, but stop? That would just be dumb.ARM produces general architectures for cores as well as other components that make up a chip. However, the actual implementation of the core, as well as any changes or additions at the system level, such as different I/O systems or things like that, are decided by the company designing the chip (eg. Qualcomm, Samsung, Broadcomm, etc.). Apple designs their own custom chips using ARM cores, so they can't get them unless the specifically hire someone to manufacture them."
"There are 4 companies that can manufacture at 14nm/16nm: Samsung, GlobalFoundries, TSMC, and Intel. Intel doesn't really offer general manufacturing to outside companies. Apple has contracts with all 3 of the others it seems, but GloFo has yield issues and TSMCs process is a bit different from Samsung's. So apple has options, but not really many.Don't worry, I wrote a few papers on ARM a while back so i know how they operate. I didn't realise the production had dropped to so few though. Was this after the flooding in Indonesia by any chance? People were leasing production rights all over only just 4 years ago. Also, i thought that intel had created their own chip and only used small parts from other companies.   Hmm perhaps there's some confusion. Not sure where it is though let me try to clarify."
"First of all, I should state that the manufacturers I mentioned are the ones who can make processors/SoCs at that scale. There may be DRAM or flash manufacturers as well, I'm less familiar with them. I think maybe micron and SK hynix have 14nm for memory? Not sure though."
"The four I mentioned are the only ones to date that have developed 14nm logic manufacturing. That means they're collectively doing the manufacture for AMD, Qualcomm, Nvidia, and anyone else trying to produce 14nm parts with a fabless model. I think you knew that but I just thought I would clarify in case that hasn't been made clear, so hopefully this doesn't sound like I'm trying to condescend."
"The issue is that finfets are a substantial r&d leap, so lots of companies are giving up in scaling, since they can't keep up with the main 4. That's lead to the current situation.Nono, no confusion. I said my info was from four years ago and I think that was the A7 chip and surrounding systems back then. it just seemed that 4 years ago more companies were producing the chips is all.Yeah, lots of people gave up around 32nm or 28nm I think. Beyond that is when traditional planar technologies started breaking down.If Apple wanted some good PR, they can take their cash surplus and open their own fab in the united states to produce their SOC's.It's just too expensive :(. Even with the reduced cost in operations and logistics and the reduced risk of production halts due to environmental change or governmental change, it's still too expensive. Don't forget you have to set up the factory and then train the skilled labour required to build the chips. Yes, but they have like 700 billion in cash reserves. I'm sure they could take 5 billion of that and invest in another USA fab to create a joint venture for a dedicated Apple Soc fab. that would look shit on their portfolio and leave their investors saying, why the fuck is that 5bn not coming back to me in dividends? Don't forget that Apple inc has let it's even slightly socialist attitude die with Steve Jobs. If you can justify the expenditure with a well thought out plan then you're gucci, if not, you are at the mercy of your board mate.But it would be a long term investment in Apples future. would it? Tell me the reasons it would be a long term investment to build a factory solely dedicated to the purpose of producing chips that could be made irrelevant in the near future in a country where the current political movement is to cut into your margins by increasing minimum wage? You can't even guarantee that your workers will buy your product dude. It's not even close to an investment.Uh, Apple is building a computer assemble plant already. Also investing in an SOC fab would enable them to ditch intel cpu's in favor of their own cpu in the coming years. Also fabs are not dependednt on menial labor, they are very dependent on highly skilled labor. So minimum wage is not an issue when it comes to fabs. They'd also get sued into the ground (hard) if Samsung broke their contract.Probably not. They'd probably just have some sort of penalty clause already in place.Yep. Liquidated damages. Exactly.  They would lose more profit by breaking the iPhone contract than they would by selling more of their phones.  It's a very tricky situation though. With Samsung being the only player making 14nm chips they are now in the position of collecting a lot of new customers and ramping up production for those new customers. Now the big wigs who write the contracts don't always take fab capacity into account...that is to say they somewhat plan for a future capacity. Problem is sometimes this future capacity just can't be reached (not in time anyway)."
"In the end though apple will get their chips just perhaps not right on time.and my point is not on time is not acceptable, and the very reason for contracts.  Apple isn't buying chips from Samsung and expecting samsung to sell them to them if and when Samsung feels like it, and lets Samsung decide, without warning, that they are no longer going to provide chips.  If Samsung diverts capacity from Apple for their own chips, or anyone else's, or just to make nothing at all, there is either a fee written into the contract, or Apple would begin the lawsuit that day for breach of contract and lost earnings.  Companies like that don't just trust other suppliers to provide vital components whenever they feel like it.Exactly! Not meeting contractually obligated supply deadlines would be way worse for Samsung since there could be heavy financial penalties. That could put further burden on their manufacturing facilities which would set back the supply of chips for their own phones. I totally agree with you. My original comment should have been worded better. It's likely more of a flexible date and is renegotiated a few times during initial product ramp. Obviously though if Samsung wants the big money and to keep future contracts they will try their hardest to crunch out every available wafer to meet the initial contract. But here's he other side of business (that i deal with daily, though on a smaller level)"
"Samsung is the only one making these. Apple can wait, or apple can sue, and then have even bigger delays in receiving the chips they need, further slowing their production."
"Samsung can't fuck with them too much, but at the same time, Apple needs Samsung and has to play ball a littleDepends entirely on the margins of each. I imagine they make more on each chip when they go into their own phones than when they sell one to Apple. Then again, Apple is known to have huge margins, maybe they passed some along to Sammy. Doubtful. Jesus you are so stupidWow, so articulate. You most be a genius to be able to form such a riveting thought.You most be a genius yourself.  Next time you insult someone's intelligence you might consider reviewing your statement before you post it.How is calling you a genius insulting your intelligence? And what would you have changed in the post, Mr. Editor?You most be joking.How so?Most you downvote me?That's *where* their huge margins come from.  They pay the lowest possible price for components and they charge a premium price for the finished goods. "
"I doubt they are inspired to share more money than they have to with Samsung.   But I've been wrong before... That was my point. I simply meant could they be paying Samsung so little that Samsung would be better off fulfilling their own needs first, even with any penalty goes along with not meeting Apple's needs. I think I replied to the wrong person, my bad. it has little to do with margins.  It has a lot more to do with Apple's contract likely having huge fines for late shipment of parts, especially if it is intentional, which Samsung choosing to supply their own phones first would be.  "
"I don't know the exact practice for phones, but with that many components coming together, they have to have financial protections in place to ensure suppliers provide parts on time.  There is no way Samsung wouldn't be hit with huge fines for not supplying what they contracted with Apple.  Now it is possible that beyond a certain point, Samsung would have fulfilled their quota and could not supply everything Apple wanted right away, but that would only come after Apple has outsold their projected numbers.I seriously doubt any contract with Samsung for parts doesn't include a clause that allows Samsung to supply their own phones first.  Why do you think Apple is worried here?  If what you said was true they would have nothing to worry about.If there is a contract then typically the penalty for failing to meet demand is way worse."
"But you would really think iPhone production sales has slowed down since they are halfway through their cycle.Pretty sure the article referenced the supposed next-gen A9 instead of the currently used A8. Ah, well you would want to believe they prepared for that before they signed a contract.Can you really imagine that Apple didn't think of that? lol> But you would really think iPhone production sales has slowed down since they are halfway through their cycle."
"So they're ramping up production for the next one. Shouldn't the next iPhone be a minor refresh though? I guess I can't think of anything the 6 did that was that much better than the 5S anyway. Maybe it will be a decent update.Flexibility, it did flexibility better.Ayyy, this guy.In procurement, it depends.  I don't know much about these chips, but -"
"If you have multiple suppliers and overall ample supply in a network, you generally can use supply agreements.  This is because as a buyer, I want the most competitive cost, and I'm not worried about finding supply in general. "
"Second tier would be basically supply contracts where you negotiate price yearly, but both parties can walk away if they can't agree on price, and the buyer doesn't necessarily need to commit to a specific volume.  And, the supplier is within their rights to supply what only what they can.  For example, there was a strike on Alumina recently with only 3 vendors domestically.  The other 2 vendors got an increase in demand beyond their capacity to produce - so they capped certain customers, at their digression.  Well within their rights."
"If you have a single supplier, or a hard to procure product, thats when you get into formal contract with very specific wordage... "
"but realistically, even those are easy as hell to break."
"#procurementlifeSssh, you're making too much sense which is taking valuable clicks away from BusinessInsider. Why you gotta break the circlejerk?Yeah what's he doing thinking stuff. It's obvious that the Samsung division in charge of chips is gonna be like fuck apple we have too many gs6s too worry about themTrue but the contract is probably y units until 201X. Problems arise when they try to renew it and samsung prioritizes their S6 production and says best we can do is way less than you need.Stop making sense you wiseguy, these guys are trying to have an anti-circlejerk circlejerk here!Yes I imagine so.[deleted]My first thought as well, probably a bad idea to have your main competitor make your shit when they need it for their productIt's kind of hard when only a handful of companies in the world make certain necessary components. Samsung's components industry is vastly different from their smartphone one. In fact they've even had lawsuits against each other or other parts of the Samsung conglomerate. Even HTC sources some parts from Samsung.Especially when you're constantly suing that competitor > it's not the best idea to source major components of your product from your biggest competitor."
"It's an even worse idea to try to sue them. Why would Samsung stop selling stuff?"
"If apple stops buying from Samsung they will buy from someone else or make it in house. So what's the point of that?Hopefully Tim Cook reads /r/technology then maybe they'll be successful. > Unless Samsung has general production problems this is unlikely to be an issue, but as a general rule it's not the best idea to source major components of your product from your biggest competitor."
"Just a quick question; you know how the split the product line with some using their own design whilst others using the Qualcomm one, were Samsung building the Qualcomm ones or were they sourcing it from an external supplier? the reason why I ask is it sounds pretty reasonable that there might be supply constraints of the Qualcomm were sourced externally but since they've moved completely to their own CPU design then it might put pressure on their fabrication capacity leaving very little room left over for third parties in their plants.They source it from the place with the best price and have contracts as such. If Samsung can't keep up to pace then they'll get it from the next best place."
"You're mistaken if you believe Samsung's chip manufacturing division prioritises the success of Samsung's phone sales division over its own sales."
"That's just not how large multi-national corporations work."
"Each is a separate business and will act independently to maximise its own profits. Losing Apple as a long term customer just to prioritise a few more Galaxy's being sold is not in the best interest of the business.That isn't how it works mate You say this as if they have other alternatives that are just as reliable they didn't consider for some reason.damn I wonder why tim cook never consulted you firstActually most of the chips come from TSMC, so I don't see the issue here.They keep two suppliers in case one struggled. >as a general rule it's not the best idea to source major components of your product from your biggest competitor."
"The exception is when you make just as much if not more money supplying the competition. This must be the case otherwise Samsung would've stopped a long time ago. The iPhone sells a ton of units, Samsung is riding the back carriage of Apple's money making train no doubt. "
"I guess the deal to supply chips to Apple kind of acts like a hedge to Samsung's risk exposure in the smart phone market. "
"To be fair, very few companies can do bigger volume and better quality than Samsung. Apple having Samsung make their parts was a good business decisionYeah no shit - why not let Intel make them?I'm not sure why you're being downvoted. That's why they don't use only one supplier: http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/04/15/apple-makes-last-minute-decision-to-use-tsmc-for-30-of-a9-chip-orders-for-next-iphoneSo what you're saying is, they're in cahoots?Or just source from GlobalFoundries. They use the same flow as Samsung.They should also have really good contracts so would be $$$ back if they can't deliver on time.>Unless Samsung has general production problems this is unlikely to be an issue, but as a general rule it's not the best idea to source major components of your product from your biggest competitor."
"At the end of the day Samsung is in the business of selling things. It doesn't really matter if they sell them to Apple or some other retailer/carrier who sells them to you.  In either case they still sell their things, and in *this* case, they're selling both ways.This is like diversifying your portfolio, but for company sales.  It's really the best move for them, haha.  Whether iPhones sell better, or Galaxies sell better, they win out.Samsung phone division buys chips from their semiconductor division.  They also buy equipments from their manufacturing division to build phones.   "
"They probably get them for a lot cheaper.Apple doesn't make chips so they don't compete with Samsung Semiconductor.Should probably call up Apple, that might be something their company hasn't thought of. "
"/sWhat if they're not actually competing, they're just doing the thing where companies create a fake kind of competition to spur consumerism when in fact they're colluding to keep the money between each other ***?*** "
"[edit] I'm not suggesting some hail corporate conspiracy, this is a well known phenomenon that one could learn about in an intro psych or Econ course"
"[edit] This was a question for discussion, I wasn't making any sort of claim you dolts! Perhaps I should've included a question mark at the end You are describing a [cartel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartel).A kartel/cartel?This does happen which is why there are laws against it. This would violate national and international antitrust laws, they would be sued for millions if not billions of dollars if they were caught. How do I know? I am an engineer and I recently had training at work regarding this issue, and then found out our company had to pay nearly 50 Million because of antitrust laws that were broken about a decade ago. It is really bad for them if they did that. And it is really really illegal. Wouldn't surprise me since Samsung did it with DRAM chips and LCD displays.Isn't this what Coke and Pepsi do?Corporations are so big these days that one department could be competing while the other department down the hall way is working together.Seeing that italicized question mark before reading your edit had me confused.That thing is called OligopolyI tip my fedora to you."
"But really, no. It is always a good idea to sell products to even to your competitors.Because that is almost certainly less profitable for both companies than if either of them didn't stick to the deal to collude.Especially with no other real competitor if they could divide the market in half both stand to make a lot of money.Ah, the old Time Warner/Comcast power divvy.Oligopoly?Beatles/Stones. It's like Canadian Bacon: Economics. Yeah uh, no. Apple and Samsung are not in cahoots to create 'fake competition'. This guy said they are not. That means they are not. 100% not in cahoots. Cause this guy said.Well they're certainly both making a fuck tonne of money from their competition. You'd be foolish to think they hope their opponent fails. The fact that you had to edit and clarify that is an actual thing that is taught in econ and behaviour learned about in psych is just astonishing."
"They are multi-billion dollar companies...The loser is only making a few billion less. Stop picking a side and pick your side, the consumer side so that they don't continue to fuck us over with incremental bullshit upgrades every year.You don't have to buy those upgrades every year, I'm still using a second hand S3 that I bought broken and fixed.It's definitely a cournot or Nash equilibrium but I'm too high to remember which one "
"Edir: Haha actually that's just the equation shit They're not colluding, they're just trying to operate a mutually beneficial arrangement for this particular part of the iPhone."
"Samsung is happy to give Apple a good deal on the parts Apple is asking of it because Samsung doesn't want Apple giving billions of dollars in business to a competitor. It also helps Samsung to remain dominant in its neck of the supply chain woods, not to mention helps Samsung get higher volume discounts and increase leverage for the parts it needs to source."
"Apple meanwhile, is happy to take advantage of the fact that Samsung is willing to give them a good deal on those parts for the reasons above."
"Samsung is in the weaker overall position here. It doesn't do anything unique or do it so well that one of its competitors couldn't do it if given the opportunity.Samsung does have a bit of a fab advantage of TSMC right now. From what I remember there isn't a fab on the planet other than samsung that can produce the chips apple is looking for.  "
"Edit: There isn't another fab on the planet that can produce the A9 at 14nm.  TSMC and GF can both do it at 20nmDing ding ding ding ding. You got it. It's funny to think that it's actually in Samsungs best interest for the iPhone to be successful because of how much they sell to Apple.They make less money off selling chips to apple than if they'd sell them in their own phones.

"this isn't Samsung - it's google, but still the main competitor of iphone and they make more money for each iphone sold than from each android device. The reason being - patent law.Samsung is not just one company. "
"Sometimes it's cheaper for them to buy Sony camera sensors than use their own."
"The same applies to apples custom chip. For Samsung Apple might be a better customer than Samsung mobile.>Samsung is not just one company."
"Samsung is a company, though. All subsidiaries are still part of Samsung.Samsung isn't one company.Really?"
">Samsung (Hangul: samseong; hanja: San Xing ; Korean pronunciation: [skamsk^NG]) is a South Korean multinational conglomerate company headquartered in Samsung Town, Seoul.Look into it more deeply. Samsung is actually several different corporations one of which is Samsung Electronics. Samsung electronics is still a subsidiary of the company Samsung.What are the odds that EVERY person that has bought an iPhone would buy a Samsung phone if there were no iPhones? ONLY in that case there would be no difference, so it's better to have Apple around.That would only be the case if they made just as much money off of selling a chip to apple as they make off selling a phone, which is a ludicrous notion.Well, someone mentioned this in the thread:"
"> Samsung Electronics has to sell the chips to Samsung Mobile the same way anyone else does. "
"So as far as Samsung Electronics is concerned, they would earn less as I've said before. Samsung Mobile, of course, could benefit ... but you never know. :)That's not the right way to look at it.  There is such a thing as value in wider distribution.  Even if Samsung makes more money per chip by selling them in their own device, making less money per chip while selling a massive number of additional chips in iPhones is still more profit than they would make otherwise.  "
"This is exactly how Trader Joes, Walmart, and Amazon's business model's work.  Companies sell their products cheaper to them knowing they will move a lot of units.  Thinner margins but higher profits.Yes and no. "
"If Apple spends marketing and overhead on capturing a segment that wasn't in the cards for them, then they can either have a small percentage of something or a large percentage of nothing. Their production levels are not restricted to their own products."
"The more chips they manufacture, the cheaper per-unit cost."
"They're not proprietary, so why wouldn't you sell to all takers?still a lot of fucking money thoThis is narrow thinking. The market saturation is higher for Apple + Samsung phones than straight Samsung.is that so? I imagine the productions costs for these chips aren't too big and they are pretty much guaranteed to always know how many they need. So there's little cost, guaranteed to sell, guaranteed to not overproduce and if they actually have set up a business contract then they are also guaranteed to have that income for a few years. I think betting on the phones could make them more money but there's way more risks involved.Are you being serious? Apple doesn't know how many phones they'll sell any more than Samsung does. And no, they cannot conceivably make as much money on selling chips to a cell phone manufacturer than by manufacturing cell phones directly. You're assuming they'd be able to turn every chip they make into a cell phone sale. Apple orders their chips based off how many phones they plan to produce, not how many they think they'll sell. That's an important distinction.As does Samsung... Why do you think Samsung has magical premonition?Right, but if Samsung produces chips for their own phones and they don't sell, that's Samsung's problem. If Samsung produces chips for Apple and Apple doesn't sell their phones, that's not Samsung's problems.I'm not sure how they do things when it comes to chip-fabbing, but Apple have been known to buy up their suppliers' production capacity and not focus on unit price. More or less to insure themselves against situations like this.It's ok, he's taken Reddit business classes. Reddit Business School must be rolling in sweet, sweet cash considering the number of redditors who seem to have their MBA.All online?Production cost?  Not really?"
"Production space?  Most certainly."
"And that is not cheap."
"Sammy ain't spending an extra billion bucks for fab facilities so apple can make bank.  Their own chips take priority.Production cost is still huge. Individually maybe not so much, but retooling their massive factories every time there's a tech upgrade costs tens to hundreds of millions.> is that so? I imagine the productions costs for these chips aren't too big  "
"Any chance you have $3-4 billion lying around to set up a plant for NAND flash memory or OLED lines? How about an additional several hundred million to set up R&D centers and hire scientists?  "
"[deleted]And if they went about that tomorrow without having a sufficient justification and promising ROI, some heads would roll. Apple shareholders are among the most demanding and vicious. Apple already got kicked and prodded around once into shelling out dividends.  and why haven't they? Apple does - maybe long term mfg is a possibility "
"Or maybe Intel will eat everyone's lunch again. Oh, if only money was something we could just throw around without consequences and restrictions. Marginal costs are not that high in *most* sectors of technology.  That's actually a huge part of why the price of technology goes down over time.But wouldn't they have that already? for a start up it'd be impossible but I imagine they already had to build these chips or chips like them any way? I could be completely wrong of course.You have to rebuild the machines every few years as well to keep up with new lithography processes. A billion dollars every year or two just to keep up with one factory.Also, when they get new lithography machines, which is fairly often because each step down in feature size often requires reengineering parts of the tool these days, the price jumps up even more. The astronomical cost of scanners, spinners, and metro these days is mind boggling... Im not saying isn't worth it. The engineering in NXT1970s is borderline magic.Yeah but that initial cost is still factored into the manufacturing cost of the chip. Depends. Will you take a two party, out of state, bad check?Source?Wrong."
"They spend **stupid** amounts of money marketing their phones, it's unbelievable how much they blow on that."
"Money spent marketing chips to Apple? Nearly zero."
"Every chip they sell to Apple turns a profit. Every phone they sell has a margin based on a crazy number of factors, many of which are beyond their control.Every chip sold does not necessarily turn a profit. Selling at a loss initially is very common in the semiconductor industry. You're often banking on process/yield improvements improving the production costs as the production run goes on. (And if you can't find them, you go bankrupt/lose money for the whole run). The flash memory industry in particular is often running razor thin margins.They're in the industry for a reason.Better sell an iPhone than any other non-Samsung though.Sure, but Samsung is already dominating the market, so someone who doesn't get an iphone is far more likely to get a Samsung rather than any other phone.>Sure, but Samsung is already dominating the market,"
"Nokia used to be #1, now they're almost dead. HTC used to dominate, now they're slipping fast. Apple used to be #1, but android ate the their lunch. Samsung won't be #1 forever, especially given how shabby their UI and OS is. (I really loathe my Note 3)"
"> so someone who doesn't get an iphone is far more likely to get a Samsung rather than any other phone."
"Not me. I don't like iOS, but I know I'll never buy another Samsung. I may go back to HTC."
"Apple was never even close to #1. They're actually currently at one of their highest percentages of cell phone market share.  "
"Profit share wise Apple got to number one, and they'll be there for the foreseeable future.Android didn't 'eat Apple's lunch' -- Apple is still way, way ahead in terms of profit generated. It's not a game of sheer units; comparing Android units shipped vs. iOS is worthless because there's toaster being sold with Android on them. If you're the business or a shareholder you care about profits, the rest of us don't give a fuck and focus more on what phone is more popular rather than which one is more profitable. I'd actually prefer the less profitable ones, on average, since those are less of a ripoff. "
"The Note 4 matches the iPhone 6+ but costs 16% less for the same storage amount (128gb 6+ is $949 vs $800 for Note 4 plus a 128gb mSD, which actually gives you 160gb total storage). The iPhone is still $50 more even if you go for the very cheapest option with half of the Note 4's internal storage and no expansion capacity. There aren't any clear cut spec wins for the iPhone here aside from low-light camera and OS preference. The iPhone actually felt slower, but probably due to hilariously too slow transition animations in a prior version of iOS.>Android didn't 'eat Apple's lunch' -- Apple is still way, way ahead in terms of profit generated."
"I was referring to units sold, not profit."
"> It's not a game of sheer units; "
"I concede this. I should have been more specific."
">comparing Android units shipped vs. iOS is worthless because there's toaster being sold with Android on them."
"Really? I want the little robot on my toast!I personally like what Sony is doing with their Xperia line. I think my household all independently of each other now have each kind of xperia device...New York used to be the best place to go, now it is Australia. Then Australia sucked so now it is Mars. What next? Is love the best place to go?Android ate their lunch??? "
"Yes, Android dominates the market by quantity but Apple is making way more money from their phones than all android providers combined.Fair enough. I was indeed referring to sold units, not the profit generated from selling units.I love the hardware on my S5, but the software is shit and the lockdowns are fucking annoying.Agreed. The hardware is fairly decent. The GPS on the Note 3 could be better. WHen I switch, I'm going to miss that screen!In terms of volume we're probably likely to see Chinese smartphone companies come up on top. I wonder if they will be able to break into the western markets as well.[no source provided]Samsung Electronics has to sell the chips to Samsung Mobile the same way anyone else does. Sometimes they're the lowest bidder, sometimes they aren't, which is why the S5 Active uses a Qualcomm chip. That's because up until now Qualcomm chips had better modems than the exynos equivalents. That's why Samsung used Qualcomm for their US models.>Samsung Electronics has to sell the chips to Samsung Mobile the same way anyone else does. Sometimes they're the lowest bidder, sometimes they aren't, "
"Pretty sure that you have to buy the products for the self-costs (and maybe an appropriate margin  added) when selling within  companies of  the same corporation  otherwise you could simply overcharge and evade taxes or manipulate operational results too easily.You'd be surprised at how much companies actually cannibalize each other so their books look better. It's called Transfer Pricing. One subsidiary can sell a product to the parent and vice a versa for a profit as they in reality are two different companies with two different budgets and goals. However when it comes to reporting for tax purposes (dependant on where you are from) the reports would be 'consolidated' to represent figures as if they are just a single entity. This is called Hollywood accounting.This (your comment, I mean) is wrong.Not really. "
"One business's 100 dollar expense to their subsidiary turns into a 100 dollar gain at said subsidiary. At the end of the year, for tax purposes, it appears like there was no sale, since the net gain/loss is zero. "
"That's called compartmentalization, with fair tax laws. [deleted]Why would they overcharge and why would the other company pay the inflated price? They both have a duty to their owners/shareholders. I may be confused in what you're saying though. Depends on your country though. >which is why the S5 Active uses a Qualcomm chip."
"No, the S5 active uses a Qualcomm chip because Samsung's Exynos chip doesn't receive on the necessary LTE bands for 4G in the US.This is the correct answer. Not just the S5 active, the S3, S4, S5, Note 4 all had snapdragon processors in the US variants due to Qualcomm's LTE radio built into the chip. The international versions of those phones used Samsung's exynos processor."
"Of course, this changed with the S6 as now Exynos has the required radio built-in and Samsung has no problems selling the Exynos variant worldwide.This is a load of nonsense."
"There has been LTE versions with Exynos since the S2. The S4 and Note 4 Snapdragons didn't have modems."
"The S6 does *not* have an integrated modem neither. Except verizon and sprint models still have a qualcomm radio chip on top of the exynos processor. Phone is labeled to show it and user guide confirms it.It's called hedging your bet.  If Samsung sells a shit ton of phones, then awesome.  However, if they don't, they still profit a bit from Apple.>They make less money off selling chips to apple than if they'd sell them in their own phones. So that's dumb."
"Citation? They sell *more* chips by selling to Apple, because if they didnt, Apple would simply get their chips elsewhere, and the only sales in this sector they'd have left is Android. Better to have sales in *both* markets than exclude yourself from your competitors market.Similarly, Microsoft makes billions from Android through patents. You are being downvoted, but it's true: Microsoft's most profitable mobile OS is... Android. [Source](http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsofts-most-profitable-mobile-operating-system-android/)Thanks for enlightening info.Marx realized that distortions of the free market like collusion and monopoly were actually the natural end result of capitalism. He was right.I'd believe you if they weren't constantly suing each other for hundreds of millions of dollars. Court isn't cheap and those stakes are a bit too high for their love/hate relationship to be a game. Besides, it would be a grave mistake for Samsung not to keep up supply to Apple, for it would all of a sudden create something dreadfully enticing about Apple's product... Scarcity. The drama and how it gives their fanboys something to cheer on might just be worth the money thougSamsung has already been busted for price fixing across multiple industries. Wouldn't put it past them to be manipulating things in the microprocessor market too.Well it's money you can keep out of marketing - because it's doing the same job. Think of it this way, if the news every other day is APPLE VS SAMSUNG, then Nokia is going to get zero love. Drama fuels news these days.suing each other Think about it. You sue me I sue you. Settle in court boom.But if they're both under the same parent company, for example, who loses what to whom?It's one to sue for hundreds of millions, but getting both sides to settle for it is another thing.not to mention that is about as much as both of them would have to pay if they were caught doing what the other comment suggested. It would be highly illegal to collude like that. You're funny to really think that hundreds of millions of dollars isn't actually cheap to them. They make double that off a single flagship device. Even if really was a charade, they have the money to do it for lulz because they know it creates competition and elitism among their consumers, which makes them even more money."
"When companies are going to each other for production / manufacturing, they're in league with each other to make money, no other reason. That's business. Both companies have way more than enough money to do court games. So you're saying... they're good actors and they sacrifice money just for the sake of their art?It's cyclic. It's not a maintained phenomenon.Court isn't cheap, but I bet they make their money back in all the free press they get. It's not cheap to buy your way into the news every day. It is cheap to swap a few hundred million between each other and get the press for free.Those suits never go anywhere.  The most that ever happens is they have to quit selling a device they already quit selling 3 years ago."
"They're scaring the competition and encouraging the public to say Oh my God - patents are evil!  We'd better reform patents so megacorps can make whatever the hell they want without paying licensing fees!What's a few hundred million among billionaire bros? It's like boxing but for rich people. Possibly 10% or more of their net worth?Unless I'm calculating wrong, it's just 0.01356% of Apple and ~~0.00004237% of Samsung. I had no idea Samsung was that huge until I looked that up, Jesus.~~ Do not believe anything I say.That doesn't seem right.  Apple's market cap is 700 billion and Samsung is 200 billion.  So the 2 billion lawsuit is 0.3% of Apple and 1.0% of Samsung.That's 200 Trillion for Samsung. They make EVERYTHING.Apple is 90% BS and bubble. Technology and capital/equipment, probably doesn't worth few billion.Are you an idiot?no. but I bet you are the idiot who owns AAPL and think it will keep climbing.Samsung, is like, huge, dude. market cap is only price x # of shares. Samsung has twice the worth of assets and equity.~~It's actually a T after Samsungs market cap ;) Took me by surprise too!~~ False misinformationNo it's 200 billion, not trillion. Where did you read the 200 trillion?Wait, 200 trillion? That doesn't seem right. It is, and it isn't. It's right ... in won. It's a bit under $200 billion in USD.Samsung Electronics has a market cap of c. $170 bn but the Samsung Group is much larger. But it is also at least partially privately held, so it is difficult to value.Samsung is a confusing corporation to keep track off because the 200 billion belongs to Samsung Electronics. They also have Samsung Engineering, Samsung C and T, Samsung Life Insurance, Samsung Everland, Cheil Worldwide, and those are only the ones still under the name Samsung: Samsung is technically also The Shinsegae Group, CJ Group and Hansol Group. They are fucking massive and hold way more than they are willing to admit, to the point of being 17% of a nations total GDP. To Korea, they are literally too big to fail. Because people think of Samsung Electronics when the word Samsung comes out, when I believe Samsung Electronics while still the blue chip subsidiary, is 1 of 60-70 companies comprising the SAMSUNG GROUP. Samsung does MUCH more than just phones. Their screens are at the bleeding edge of technology in all departments, processors, TVs, lots of household machines...They also build sentry guns if that means anythingMaybe this is the most important thing...Not to mention Samsung Heavy Industries which built some of the tallest and largest structures ever."
"Though technically they're a different company. Wtf that is a thing?Samsung is one of world's top 3 shipbuilders.  They also built part of the Burj Khalifa.  They also run an investment bank.  And they sell artillery.  And life insurance.  And even jet aircraft now.  They are much bigger than just electronics although electronics is their largest division.  But a single old man is behind the whole Samsung family. He's in the works of combining and shifting all Samsung companies to minimize inheritance tax when he dies.When South Korea rebuilt, they had the entire country behind the companies. A few companies own everything in Korea. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChaebolThe baseball teams in Korea are named after companies instead of cities like in the US......Samsung Lions.Well, the corporations tend to own the stadiums over here instead. Ignoring stuff like Nascar etc. of course.Nah.  Apple even conspired with Microsoft and Google to keep engineer salaries down at one point.   They're corporations, they keep their daggers in their left hands even as they shake on their deals and both companies know it.    You couldn't differentiate between their collusion and their backstabbing.  Even THEY probably can't.You see very clearly my friend, might want to watch your back with those eyes.It's like Game of Thrones but with nerds.> It's like Game of Thrones but with nerds."

"These companies are so big they don't know who's who sometimes. except a lot of what people are describing is incredibly illegal. They would likely have to pay tens of millions of dollars if they were caught colluding like that. Collision doesn't have to be spoken. Both companies can essentially collude by matching each others pricingI saw it happen at AT&T first hand.  The upgrade fee for getting a new phone used to be much lower ($18 I think), and it used to be waived quite often.  We got an email from corporate saying Verizon charges $26, so we're going to start doing that too."
"Of course this was years ago.  That upgrade fee is up to $40 now.  I'll likely switch providers when it's time for my next phone."
"Only tens of millions?Tens of millions is nothing compared to their billion dollar law suitsTens of millions < what they actually make from the shenanigans That hasn't stopped it from happening a hundred times over in the past. Do you really think that everything that goes on inside these massive multi-national companies is lawful?"
"Huge companies with a too big to fail mindset break the law on a daily basis, and most of the time nothing is done about it. They all have their secrets. Even if they do get caught and charged the court cases will take years if not decades to play out. of course not which is why companies are caught breaking those laws all the time. Even then, what they end up being fined or sued for could be less than they illegally gained from doing so.Haha, not in a million of years. Samsung is really a bunch of separate companies. They sell shit to themselves at market value, since when you're selling Chips to people like apple, they won't keep buying it of you're supply the competition for next to nothing. So yes, Samsung would save money on their own phones, but they'd likely lose a lot of supply deals for chips and displays etc. Not worth it. > Samsung is really a bunch of separate companies."
"Not really. Its merely their structure. Samsung, like MANY SE ASIAN countries runs their corporations almost like state corps."
"They are often family, however they treat them like private state corporations - its complicated."
"But SAMSUNG is more a single company than the design and marketing teams at Apple. Sorry to burst that well voted bubble."
"Samsung - is FUCKING MASSIVE.Actually, they run them like I said they run them, as separate, independent companies. There is no need to clarify it. It is obvious they are all under the samsung umbrella, but just because the mobile  device says samsung on it, doesn't mean they can get the SOC at manufacturing cost. They pay the same rates as anyone else. >Samsung is really a bunch of separate companies"
"That's not the half of it. Samsung is a multinational conglomerate made of hundreds of separate giant corporation in fields like construction, finance, insurance, chemical supply, hotels, medicine, and yes, electronics."
"The South Korean headquarters had 2010 revenues of 280 TRILLION dollars(EDIT: It is actually Won, so 260 billion dollars). Nevermind the rest of the world.Where did you get that number? Sound unlikely. Maybe it's Won.Doh, you are right. It was South Korean Won."
"So about 260 billion US dollars."
"Which for comparison, South Koreas entire GDP is only 1000 billion.I don't know how you can not worth it and summarize a bazillion dollar company (that practically runs South Korea's economy) when they probably have some of the most talented business people and accountants analyzing this very thing every day.Because the money they make as a whole by manufacturing products for other corporations, is more money than they'd make via profits on an s6 without paying for the chips. But they're all under the Samsung umbrella... so it doesn't really matter *what* the price is, since it's just moving cash from one internal accounting ledger to another.It doesn't matter to Samsung as a whole, it certainly matters to each section. Yup. Samsung is what is known as a Chaebol in Korea or Keiretsu in Japan."
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaebol+1 and also, Samsung Electronics is divided into its well-known consumer goods division (which makes phones, TVs, white-goods) and its Device Solutions division, which makes chips for the consumer goods division and other customers including Apple. These two divisions are in direct competition with each other and, as far as I understand, the DS division does not give preferential treatment to its brother. Chaebols are interesting like that.So if Samsung did Apple would look for a different supplier to combat competition. Why aren't they looking for a different supplier to combat competition already? More expensive? In that case Apple is only Samsung's customer because they're the cheapest and if they sold chips to competitors for next to nothing Apple would need to pay more in order to make Samsung lose chip-business, which begs the question why they aren't doing this already rather than prolong Samsung's grip on their chip-supply.The branch of samsung that supplies their chips isn't in direct competition with them, that's the point. Yeah they even have a division of samsung that makes and sells Samsung cars Yeah, the big Chaebols are similar to big Japanese companies like Sony. It's not uncommon to see one division of Sony actually sue another division.Which also makes me believe the whole article doesn't make sense. Apple has some good projections on how many mobiles they will sell and whatever else they need from Samsung. They make agreements on delivery these chips and these are some serious amounts. So it's pretty much a given that like any other agreement that if Samsung wouldn't live up to the agreement they would get a serious penalty."
"At the same time Samsung is huge and I seriously wonder how much the impact of 1 successful mobile would have on their production line. If the S6 would be very successful and can disrupt, then why this wouldn't happen before with other products by other parties if they were suddenly demanding more then expected."
"Nah... funny article but unless someone with some insight in chip production can shed some light on how this works I seriously doubt it.Samsung hasn't been making large scale SoCs for awhile now and they're the only ones on a 14nm process.  Concerns about output capabilities are relevant >14nm"
"For comparison, pentium IIIs were 130nm. Die have shrunk tenfold since 2000.They are different divisions. They generally don't try to cannibalize sales from another division. The reason Samsung survives is diversification. Even when the mobile division has been going down in recent years, the others keep the company as a whole afloat. Apple is their semiconductors division's largest client. They aren't going to just balk on a contract. Samsung isn't going to be able to cover the losses from Apple by selling their own product. If people want the iPhone, they will wait for them. Not just suddenly pick Samsung. They have nothing to gain from trying to screw over Apple by not meeting production needs. It may cause even more clients to distrust them and find alternate suppliers. Bad business to let one division's goal ruin another independent division.Which comes back to what I previously mentioned, both parties are fully aware of their expectations and legally they are probably bound tight together for not allowing any disagreements between each other. This isn't like either party does something new, they know fully what they committed to. With it, I find it impossibly to believe that Samsung would short Apple allowing for probably legal punishment and to be considered an untrustworthy supplier. And especially the latter to be branded that could have serious consequences also towards other clients (future) from Samsung.People don't seem to understand 'Samsung' is just the umbrella company and the company that sells chips to Apple is not the same company that sells the GalaxyWell in this case they're the same company : Samsung Electronics. Yes, Samsung makes all kinds of shits but the company that makes Galaxy and the one makes Exynos/A9 chips are happens to be the same one."
"Interestingly enough Samsung display is a separate company. This! Samsung semiconductors bids for the contract for the Galaxy chips the same way any other company would, this is why some versions of the galaxy had other processors in the past, and sometimes they source the memory chips too. [deleted]That really doesn't diversify it enough. They sell food, they sell clothing, I'm pretty sure they sell furniture.They also sell cars and death robots standing guard at the DMZ. The reach is mind-boggling.They're also in banking, insurance, hospitality and health care."
"I'm not kidding. I didn't realise how massive Samsung was.Oil tankers, artillery, medical machinery, etc. They make it all.And, weapons. A whole lot of weapons.Have you tried the whole new Samsung AK47? They say it's great on the inside but the edges make it easy to break.I've heard there's a firmware update coming out for it soon that reloads it when you put it in the microwave.[deleted]I want a tank with NFC and wifi.

"> Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge smartphones will exceed sales expectations, according to a new note from KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, and that could hurt Apple&#039;s access to the A9 processors that Samsung produces for the next-generation iPhone."
"> Samsung needs all the good news it can get - its sales after the launch of the older Galaxy S5 models went into decline, so if the S6 range really is taking off - as Kuo says - then Samsung is likely to favor its own phones over those of Apple."
"> Kuo says that Samsung is expected to raise its shipment guidance for both the S6 and S6 Edge for the full year by roughly 40%, to 50-55 million units In the note, Kuo says the main driver is strong demand for the higher-end Galaxy S6 Edge device, which has a curved screen."

"Here's another vouch for Ming-Chi from 9to5mac:  "

"That makes the title wrong. Nobody knows if Apple is worried. This analyst thinks Apple is. That's not news.Maybe you don't know but why couldn't he? Because he thinks, which means he's uncertain, which means he doesn't know.Well in the article they flat out say "
">Apple is worried that if Samsung's manufacturing unit will prioritize its Galaxy range over its orders."
"When did Apple say that? In what context? Is it a direct quote or an analyst's prediction? It would be one thing to say Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo thinks Apple should be worried or Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo thinks Apple is worried, but they flat out said Apple **SAID** they were worried.You guys are awfully defensive over some random article Someone is WRONG on the Internet !If you ever get proved wrong, just scream FANBOY.I'd be defensive if it was about anything else too. It's just ridiculous how blatantly BI lies/exaggerates, that's all. Or they just hate clickbait, like anyone with a brain should.Why are you defending blatant clickbait?I made one statement about one comment in the article.  Is there an extension that will warn me before I go to some of these bullshit sites? I always end up there by accident. Agreed 100%Yup, read the original article, it mentions Samsung in a single paragraph and Business Insider chooses to make that the focus of their entire article because it gets more readers by pumping up the Samsung-Apple rivalry. BGR is in the same boat. just hype galore, no substance. I thought there were some indian mass produce press release click bait machine, but it turns out they are some news wannabe in NYc.[deleted]BGR back then was completely different to how it is now. "
"Back then it was just him and he used to get a lot of big scoops, especially to do with RIM/Blackberry. Then he sold to a media firm for millions and it turned in to BI-lite. Seriously. An *analyst* thinks that Samsung won't make enough chips. There is nothing from Apple like the headline implies.Oh, well if Business Insider says so it MUST be true. Seriously the worst site on the tech scene.BuzzfeedinsiderThis is pure silliness. This article is bullsht.Ugh, I hate clicking on business insider without realizing it's business insider (tech tabloid).Samsung makes money from every Samsung and apple phone sold.  That's a damn good position to be in.**Samsung Semiconductor** makes money from every **Samsung Electronics** and **Apple** phone sold. They're in the same family but they're not the same company.This post is incorrect, Samsung Semiconductor & Communications is part of Samsung Electronics and has been so since Samsung Semiconductor merged with Samsung Electric in the 80s. The two are different divisions within side Samsung Electronics Co (see their quarterly [report](http://www.samsung.com/us/aboutsamsung/investor_relations/financial_information/downloads/2014/2014_business_quarter03.pdf) for a breakdown). And Microsoft makes money from every android phone sold... Stuff is weird sometimes. Patents make it really weird, but Samsung is winning on hardware too."
"I thought some of the big boys just had open patent agreements.This is pure bullshit.  Apple would have a contract with Samsung's semiconductor production house to produce the chips for them and would have information in the contract about meeting certain numbers.  Just because another arm of the company has a phone that uses a similar chip is doing well they wouldn't stop work on another customer's order to work on their own stuff.  This article reeks of shit.I'm sure Samsung will cut pretty much any other phone production before cutting the S6 or iPhone 6 CPU."
"Especially the crappy low end phones they make.Those low end phones are on a different process, the only ones using the 14nm are the high end flagship phones.  There is no other phones to really cut and samsung has priority because they had the contract first, apple is buying for next generation so they have not even likely finalized the contracts.Pure clickbait. The original article this is pulled from lays out three factors, including "
">  GlobalFoundries' A9 chip yield rate is said to currently be at about 30 percent yield rate, which is well below what Kuo said is a mass-production basic requirement of 50 percent."
"And "
">TSMC's competing 16-nanometer FinFET Turbo design has exceeded Apple's expectations in both yield rate and performance.I work in the industry.  Companies will absolutely make chips on 30% yield and attempt to crank up volume production.  Foundries will do almost anything to secure a contract, especially if they have the available capacity.  That's not to say it's ideal, but companies will absolutely do it.lol just some more predictions from an analyst."
"These are the types of people that said the PC is dying, netbooks are the future, tablets will replace PCs, smartphones are not needed (this would be around a decade ago), Android would not be a hit, etc.This type of articles is starting to get boring."
"Its more like of false advertising."
"They create this mindset that there is ahigh demand which they can't cater to."
"Funny thing is that every device which is short in supply always ends up being on the shelfs for a really really long time.Samsung might make more money from selling Apple components than they do from selling their own phones.Samsung doesn't care, it's making money either way."
"But not delivering to Apple could make them vulnerable to lawsuits for breach of contract.Not just lawsuits, it sends a clear message to their clients: We're looking out for #1, fuck our other obligations. Everyone they supply gets to re-negotiate at some point and reliability is usually a top requirement. If there is any question about their commitment they will likely get cold feet.riiiight... i'm sure apple's production contract with samsung allows the latter to say sorry man, we're too busy to do your stuff right now."
"samsung is a chaebol.  they're a literal megacorporation, involved in many major industries.  the fact that a small part of them happens to make phones means as fuck-all to the part of them which makes processors as it does to the part which builds ships or the part which sells life insurance.Wait... the chips for the iPhone are made by Samsung??They're designed by Apple but since they don't have the factories to fabricate their own chips it's done by whoever can supply them the cheapest or in highest volume. That tends to be Samsung. Yes. They supply a lot of other parts for Apple, most notable being displays and SSDs. what should apple fanboys feel about this?The company that sells chips to Apple is not actually the same company that sells Samsung Mobile brand phones.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Electronics"
"Yes it is.You're right, I probably heard it wrong somewhereNothing, because Samsung doesn't actually design it. I don't hate Samaung, I'm just not a fan of their software. [deleted]Samsung mechanical drives were mostly always made by Seagate. It's why they suck."
"However, Samsung SSDs are separately designed, manufactured, and sold by Samsung Semiconductor.What happened to not using Samsung produced materials? Is it because they can't find enough vendors to replace the volume Samsung could produce at?I guess so. I thought apple was designing and building its own fabrication plant. Might just not be ready yet.Its because samsung makes the best hardware, pretty much nobody else comes close, if you want top quality you go to samsung.  They could have a lower quality screen and SSD if they went somewhere else but apple would have a hard time justify not using the top quality components.High up in company's like Apple and Samsung the little fanboy wars don't exist. Samsung signs a deal with apple because they don't give a shit. Samsung as a whole makes money from every iPhone sold AND every galaxy phone sold. That's a great position. They wouldn't turn that away just because oooh apple. "
"Same with apple. It's a business deal. "
"Samsung displays are currently superior to other display manufactures. Lg is close behind. Samsung is also a very good chip fabricator.I'm not 100% sure as to why but generally Samsung displays have less problems and SSDs have better preformence. Samsung SSD's (at least the consumer-grade models) regularly out-perform most other SSD's on the market.Welp... TIL, I guess.Doubt it. Usually, this is when iPhone 6 sales start to taper off in preparation for the 6s or whatever they're gonna call it. Apple knows production can be ramped up. Non issue I think....Samsung will make more money still making chips for Apple.Based on the article the switch is most likely 100% about the chip apple will used next.  Which will likely be a TSMC chip.  Thus they want to start dipping their toes and ordering some chips from TSMC before they go all the way in.Here is a word cloud of all of the comments in this thread: http://i.imgur.com/CDNi6gC.png  "
"[^source ^code](http://github.com/Winneon/makeswordclouds) ^| [^contact ^developer](http://reddit.com/user/WinneonSword) ^| [^faq](https://github.com/Winneon/makeswordclouds#faq)Working in corporate has made me realize how much competition works directly with one another We, the normal consumer people, also see the effects of competition. Take it to the IT market. Years ago there were battles to be fought for fastest graphics cards, fastest cpu. Now a cpu camp and gpu camp won (I believe this to be true) so basically all you see are some weak iterations of a previous product. I'm sure in those camps there is still the R&D going on but without competition they don't need to switch technology. Good Guy Samsung: In direct competition with Apple. Makes parts for Apple anyway.Extremely unlikely this is going to be a problem, but I'm going to laugh my butt off if there is a problem and Apple ends up switching to Snapdragons.When the cell phone wars finally settle, I'll still be happy over here with my HTC.Why does apple buy stuff from Samsung?Apple doesn't actually make things. They design them and pay other people with manufacturing know-how to do the buildy-buildy stuff."
"Samsung started pretty much just doing the buildy-buildy stuff and transitioned into also making their own things."
"Long story short, Samsung still makes lots and lots of things. Some of which Apple buys.So who from Apple said this? How can you prove the S6 will sell more than expected?it already sold 10 million unitsHaven't read the story, but just from the title my response is, if you're concerned... don't announce it publicly! If Samsung didn't realize this before, you've just put the thought into their heads.So samsung can slam apple at anny time?Apple should have just bought Motorola and made their own chips.Apple just has to make better products, then people might start buying them again. Problem solved. I don't feel bad for apple. They could do the hard work instead of buying other peoples components.The Samsung s6 is doing better because contracts are up from the s4I had no idea Samsung made the chip for iPhones. Huh. The more ya know I'm just pissed the S6 doesn't have a removable battery, and SD card.  They also got rid if the waterproofing of the S5.  So stupid!Agreed. I bought the S5 because it was water resistant and had a removable battery. These two features we huge for me because I often will spend the day away from home on long runs and bike rides and I use my phone to track my progress, heartrate and play music. I burn through battery doing this so it is nice to be able to just pop my battery out and drop a new one in. I also like to load up SD cards with music and swap them out on occasion. "
"All these features made me not once consider an iPhone, because I can't live without them. Exactly!  I won't be buying the S6 because of these changes.  I'm a bit upset that it's apparently doing so well as I don't want all companies to lock-down their phones.Waterproofing I feel you. That sucks. But who actually swaps their battery out? I know a couple people with Android phones and they never do. I swap my batteries out constantly. And so does my wife. It is really nice to never have to tether your phone to a charger, just keep spare batteries around and swap when it is going dead. We both have three batteries. I actually have three batteries.  I bought a spare with a charger, then my brother gave me his old one.  It's invaluable on work trips (I travel a lot), where I might not be able to plug in all the time.  Also, have you ever run out of juice on a late-night at the bars, at a concert, or at a sporting event?  I don't."
"Also, if I'm charged, I can lend my spare out to friends who don't have one.  Spares are also very cheap, and having a built-in batt replaced is expensive.I just have a mophie case. 120% extra battery life. That's another option, but how much did it cost?  My total battery investment is probably under 30 bucks, and that's likely a liberal guess. "
"Edit:  This includes charger, and shipping100 bucks. But I'd rather have a seamless phone than be able to swap batteries. Good thing we all have options. And with the S6, we lose them :(I always buy a spare battery and keep it charged.  Many of the S5 docks out there sport a spare batter slot.  It's even better than having a battery pack, as there's no charge time, just swap it and go.I hate the fact that within 9 months of owning a phone, I need a new battery.  I can get OEM batteries for less than $40... Now how much was it again to send the device in to have a battery replaced?  I know Apple was charging $128 for the 3GS way back when...How much will Samsung charge?*rips off shirt, flexes, then slaps an iPhone out of someone's hands* Don't worry, buddy. I know a guy.Maybe apple should make their own damn chips then. Maybe Apple shouldn't rely on Samsung to make their chips.....uhh...yeah and how many chip fabs exist in the world...it's about 5, and Intel doesn't do outside work> and Intel doesn't do outside work"
"http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/foundry/overview.htmlWhy doesn't Apple make its own chips?  Why are they outsourcing to their biggest competitor?Because Apple doesn't make any chips. They just design them and contract out the production. There are very few companies in the world that do. ARM doesn't even make its own chips.I don't deny his. Just find the whole situation ironic "
"So sue 'em. /sWhy not?  Sell chips to apple, sell phones to people.  Get paid twice.Well gee, maybe they shouldn't have bought parts from their competitor.Most companies who buy products have a second source agreement that states if the supplier can't build to the agreed upon quantities, they have to release their designs to another company who can make the product. "
"If Apple didn't do this properly, it's their own fault. Why doesn't apple just make their own? I just want Amazon to fulfill my S6 order...Good..... goooood..Still weird for me that Samsungs making things for Apple, a competitor. Well if it rakes them big money why not eh.. Edit: i just answered my own question Can't happen because Samsung's phone division and chip division are separate entities.And this is the same Samsung they are constantly suing?Concepts like corporations can't be worried. [deleted]watch ?Haha, misread title. My apologies. Deleting now. This title got me hungry.Damn, didn't even know the S6 was out yet. I seem to be on the odd numbered galaxies, but I'm so pleased with my S5 thus far I'm wondering if I'll even feel the itch to upgrade when the S7 comes out.Biggest thing I noticed playing with one in shop was the fact that the six swipes pages is reduced to three."
"I also love my 5.You don't just up and move fabs on a whim. You have to design a chip for a specific fab. Samsung probably got backup plans, not having enough chips for Apple would cost Samsung a lot!So Apple went back to Samsung for a9 chips?When you source externally this issue is imminent, Apple seriously needs to fix its vertical integration.clickbait from shit-tier rag Business Insider? must be /r/technology"
"Tim Cook was COO of Apple for a decade, the odds of this being an issue are precisely zeroDafuq? Samsung made the chipsets for their competitor? This is exactly where and how the iPhone is made"
"http://financesonline.com/uploads/iPhone-infographic.jpgWow, that graphic is depressing.  I mean, think of all those people in China whose lives consist of:"
"* wake up in the factory dorm"
"* eat factory-provided breakfast"
"* work 12 hour shift doing monotonous assembly work"
"* eat factory-provided dinner"

"I think I'd kill myself if that was as good as life ever got.So you better buy one before we run out ( deg [?]? deg) - AppleAnyone else think it's funny that the new S6 is more iPhone-like (non removable battery, no SD slot, metal casing) and is suddenly selling better?For those wondering why Samsung 6 is doing better than Samsung 5, IMHO a huge selling point of Samsung 6 is that it is running Android version 5 which has tones of new features.>it is running Android version 5 which has tones of new features"
"Your point?  So do Samsung S5's, or I should say that most carriers in the US now offer Lollipop upgrades to their S5 phones.  IMHO, the two top reasons why S6 seems like it will ultimately outsell the S5 are 1) better build quality and 2) end of the 2yr contract cycle for the wildly popular S4.Such tripe. Samsung Semiconductor (as in the bit of Samsung Electronics that makes chips) is for all intents and purposes a completely separate company to the one that manufactures phones. It's set up like that for Samsung's benefit - allows the business to take contracts like the one with Apple. And they will have a contract to manufacture by X date that will bare no relation to how the Galaxy S6 is performing. "
"Source: Work for Samsung Semiconductor's UK PR agency. Please do not share Business Insider and think it's a valid source for news I bet you BGR and The Verge don't report on thiswell a simple solution to that is make your own fucking chips.Each division of Samsung is basically a different company. The people that work for 'Samsung Chips' probably barely know the people working in the 'Samsung 'Phone' division. Huge scopes of work are put out to bid by company's like Apple and Samsung won the contract to supply. Each division of a company like Samsung works on it's own cash flow basis and the bottom lines are added into the main Samsung company to make it a whole. Go to Intel, Apple!!!I'm still pissed that Verizon and AT&T have been removing the Microsoft apps that I was promised from all their S6s.Lol that isn't Samsung's fault. T-Mobile yoDid i say it was Samsungs fault? Fuck T-Mobile. I'm never buying an S6, i'm just pissed that the carriers are removing Microsoft products from phones. The only decent software on the fucking brick.Well you're an angry fucker. T-Mobile is the shit I'll have you know, and my nexus 6 is chock full of cool shit. You might like it, but wait, if you want the pure android experience you'll have to get... T-Mobile. I am an angry fucker, an angry fucker who doesn't like Android at all. I will retract my Fuck T-Mobile statement. They're pretty alright in my book, that said I'm on Cricket so I can play around with whatever GSM phone I want just as easily. Slower data perhaps, but much cheaper.It's cool I'm an angry fucker who really misses symbian and where maemo was going but then Microsoft bought (killed) Nokia. I even bought a blackberry classic when it came out but the horrible Bluetooth problems killed it. you have to go tmob it seems for a vanilla experience. such a shame but expected.Isn't that exactly the risk you run when you contract your largest competitor to be a parts supplier?Apple would be stupid not to have a second source contract for these chips.The problem is not many people can make them, samsung is the only one doing 14nm, you could compromise and go with 20nm but you end up slower and with worse battery life.I picked up my s6 today. It feels shockingly like an iPhone..... might be a reason its doing better. No they are not worried. Apple should start making it's own chips.The last thing Samsung should do is cut back on iPhone chips due to a quarter with better than expected sales. lol. No matter what Samsung wins.No they aren't So there's no evidence whatsoever for the title, it's basically made up. Apple is moving some production to a different supplier, that's it. There could be a million different reasons, some of them even actually cited in the article. The idea that this is somehow about the Galaxy S6 is a complete fantasy made up by one analyst mentioned in the article."
"No problem. Apple can just double the price of the iPhone and sales will drop by 10% and there are enough chips to go around. Problem solved.Apple has a well establilshed history of starting partnerships with companies and then fucking them over.  There were companies licensed to make Mac clones, but when they sold too well, Apple pulled the rug out from under them.  Then the same thing with HP licensed to build branded iPods."
"So now apple is finding out what it's like to have a company decide it's not in their best interests to help Apple out.  cry me a river.Don't forget Motorola/iTunes So to be clear, samsung removed the replaceable battery AND the insertable SD card and they're selling better than expected? That's sad.Fandroids are quietly ignoring these changes after years of trolling iPhones and their users. Also, it bends.Yes, because although places like /r/technology and /r/android judge a phone based on those two features, many of the people buying  the phone aren't going to miss them and would prefer a nicer looking premium phoneThere are unibody premium phones that have microsd slot. Just like the samsung s6 has the sim slot there, another slot at the side or just behind it could be possible. But they want to sell the higher memory version so that's not going to happen."
"Hopefully the note 5 will have mucrosd slotApple is not worried about anything.If they can't get the components for their phones, yes they would be."
"The logistics of changing a vendor for components on an already designed product like the iPhone aren't as easy as googling a chipset vendor and putting X million of them in your cart.[removed]Genuinely sorry i buy products you don't approve of. Please forgive me.I don't see what the big deal is about the GS6 though, especially in comparison to the GS4/5. "
"There are no special features that distinguish it from the older phones, other than appearance. And maybe a bit of speed."
"(Typing this from the GS6 I pointlessly upgraded to)Wait til the Gear VR launches in may (according to lots of rumours).s6 is junk.Worried.... That's funny How is the S6 doing good? The reasons why I stayed with android is because I can remove the battery if mine dies and have extra storage space. Mobile employee here; not sure why you're getting downvoted. The s6 is not water resistant, does not have a replaceable battery, and does not have expandable memory. The mismatching colors between the button and the phone itself drive me crazy, and the external camera saw no improvements beyond the s5. At a consumer level, there seems to be very little interest in the phone and frankly I'm not surprised. I declined the option to upgrade from my s5. I don't care what anyone says, this phone just did not offer anything I want other than a sharper display.I am getting down voted because Reddit gets mad when I don't like something, but this is a price of tech. Also yes I only had a s3 and I am staying with LG because of the reasons said before. > At a consumer level, there seems to be very little interest in the phone"
"Is that why they've sold a million of them already?Wow, you would not be downvoted if you wrote that a year or so ago... People change their minds I guess. Yea, beats me. No external SD card is the killer for me. It's pretty much the main reason I switched over to android in the first place.For what it's worth, in 13 years I've never replaced a phone because of a battery issue. I always get the new phone when my contract runs out though so I'm sure that plays a part. Either way. I'm on my 3rd iPhone now and have never had a battery issue. Also I'm sure the new phones are better... But I wasn't a big fan of my old flip and slide phones with batteries because the backing a would slide off when I pulled it out of my pocket.For me its more about the expandable memory. i own a go pro & it saves having to plug my camera into a computer to look at the photos & videos, i can just put it in my phone & straight to instagram or facebook. Plus once you own 2 or 3 micro sds you can keep one empty & fill one with music or apps. Then if you are going to disneyland for a day switch them out & you can take 1000s of photos & videos. Though i can see how for some people its not that big of a deal> For what it's worth, in 13 years I've never replaced a phone because of a battery issue."
"This is almost completely based on the fact that there weren't any high resolution screens back then."
"Even your iPhone right now doesn't have the high resolution a lot of Android phones have and which causes more battery drainage (not always, but a lot of the time). Hence a switchable battery is a nice plus to have."
"Oh I see! you mean running out of battery. Yea that's true. I guess I could also use my extended battery pack, but I do see a benefit for replacing it completely.>Oh I see! you mean running out of battery. Yea that's true. I guess I could also use my extended battery pack, but I do see a benefit for replacing it completely."
"I carry three spare batteries for my Note 3. A replaceable battery is a must for me.Could you describe your daily usage that requires three spare batteries? I'm genuinely curious. We aren't talking about finding an outlet at the end of the day. We're talking about the battery being the shortest living component rendering the rest of the phone worthless when it dies.How is that? Well because not that many people actually care about that stuff.Is it that hard to understand that other people have needs that differ from your own?For some, it probably is. Tough shit, Apple."
"Use some of the half-a-trillion-dollars you're sitting on and open your own chip fab if you can't properly manage your supply chain.[deleted]Who has innovated recently in the phone space?Googles Project Ara is one to keep an eye out for.Samsung just made a new flagship phone without a removable battery and expandable storage. Such innovation."
"[deleted][deleted][deleted]Won't they be using a different chip than the S6?"
"Apple spends all their money on Design and Marketing. Than they put bargain tech which was slightly better than the previous model and charge consumers top dollar for their shit."
"Its been their business model for years now. Throw in a small bit of innovation into a pretty package and people eat it up.Innovation lol.The S5 missed projections because it wasn't much of an improvement on the S4. Sure it had waterproofing, USB 3.0, and fingerprint scanner, but none of those features are sellers."
"The S6 is an actual improvement.How? I'm geniuniley curious. People have been posting that the camera is the same, they've removed external memory, and removable battery. Seems like it's got a fancier case is all. What else is improved?This title sums up everything I despise about American capitalism."
"People go on about iPhone vs Android, and Apple is laughing all the way to the bank while Samsung gets paid no matter what you buy. Two major competitors are essentially partners and cornered a majority share in their respective market.The galaxy s6 edge is a freaking sick phone. are there still people who chose the iPhone over better smartphones?It's pretty crass to compete with a customer, but I guess they decided to hop into bed with each other anywayIn 6 months....  There are reports of an unexpected rise of depression and suicide among wealthy people in NY and LA.  Without apple, we cannot judge our self worth.Need to know samsungs production capability, and how apple actually feels about it. Conclusion BULLSHITI liked the camera but I have to say I was unimpressed with the S6.  That all glass body feels like crap to hold Typically what they've lied and cheated to prevent in the past. Maybe they'll risk recruiting child labor again?Why doesn't Apple just produce their own chip?Yup, look up the hollow corporation principle."
"This isn't the 50's anymore, companies don't produce stuff from start to finish."
"The big name designs and markets the product, many 3rd party suppliers and manufacturers build, store and ship them."
"I think Nike was a pioneer in this area.No they're not. They have something called a contract.And of course you know exactly what this contract says ...I don't need to know exactly what the contract says. I know they're not idiots and there will be clauses surrounding failure to deliver what they promise. It's the basis of any services rendered contract.They will most likely have set a minimum quota which isn't enough because the iPhone 6-sales are higher than expected.Their lawyers aren't this stupid.Neither are Samsung's.Exactly, so this article is stupid. No one is worried.I don't buy Apple products and never have and other than one unrealized purchase I don't own Samsung products and never have. That SSd was a rapid purchase and I was going off reviews without reading brands. Then they killed that with firmware So I don't have it Anymore. As such I rather both companies didn't exist."
"But the point is that I don't support either company due to their sweatshop conditions for production being very highlighted and obvious."
"So really my only option has been Microsoft or Google products and so I've used android for a while now. Though, my phone doesn't really use apps as they all seem stupid or useless other than a notepad or banking app. I also never really got much use with ROMS so I stopped doing that. But the Android phone works so there's that. I don't mind supporting Microsoft via that.I just had the worst three days of my life, I just bought a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Smartphone. Nothing smart about this phone, I have been on the phone with T-Mobile for hours trying to get this phone to work. The Welcome screen gets stuck and it won't let you get past the WiFi screen. T-Mobile won't admit that something is wrong, they just keep giving me the run around. The last support person told me to call the manufacturer (Samsung) because she did know what to do.  They told me to take it to a T-Mobile store, I bought this darn thing on the T-Mobile website,  now, they want me to run around to find someone to fix it. BTW, there is no T-Mobile stores in my area. This looks like a great phone, I really like for it to work.Doesn't samsung always outsell apple?"
"Edit: downvote my looking up statistics, quickly. [deleted]At least not in the US, samsung's lower end phones do outsell iPhones, but that's not a valid comparisonAre you saying this chart is fake then ?  "
"http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GS243_samapp_GR_20150129231408.jpg or perhaps you have an odd definition of neverWeird, just checked the stats and someone has since changed it last I checked. Before it used to say apple was almost always in third globally, Asian markets buying mainly samsung apparently, but the new stats have padded the numbers to change that. That said 2013 samsung sold a total of 445 million phones and apple sold 150 million. "
"According to Wikipedia. "
"Edit: just looked at the annual sales by company. According to Wikipedia, samsung always sells more than apple. I love that people downvote you without actually finding out what you said was true. Guess you struck some sort of nerve.Well, it goes both ways. Either they think i'm a fanboy getting som apple hate on, or they are. Thats what you get for being anti-american you apple cunts. dey took our jerbs. Guess its time for apple to spend some of its cash on hand and buy Intel. Til apple has Samsung make key chips for their flagship phoneBeen common for quite sometime... and while Apple does manufacture some of their own chips, primarily their A series of processors, they'd never be able to keep up with demand if they had to do entire chipsets. It's for this reason that I don't think Macs will be going ARM anytime soon... though, looking back at the mess IBM got into with the G5 and Motorola, in its original attempts to create a successor to the m68k, it's comical how Apple always ends up having chip issues. "
"And before anyone accuses me of bashing Apple, I'm typing this on a 2009, 17 Macbook Pro.Apple has enough money to make the problem go away if needed. If there are any apple execs on here please please buy AMD please please I have some shares :)AMD's culture is the polar opposite of Apple and even Intel at least in their CPU division.One thing to consider is the fact that these are the two biggest names in phones. Why does Samsung make chips for it's competitor? well think about this, if they said they wouldn't they would then be declared a monopoly which is illegal, and likely would be forced to break into two companies, one that makes the phones and one that makes the chips. But they are doing the smart thing and instead taking in all that money from Apple to make components for the iphone. "
"Also I think a lot of you people do not realize how products are actually manufactured. one company doesn't just make their product anymore, they are going to buy components from all over the world to go into their product in the cheapest way possible, and then for their proprietary work they make it in house OR outsource it to a contract manufacturer like apple does with iphones. This kind of thing is common. When jobs was running things, I thought they would pay for chips years in advance to corner the market?Yup, this article is bullshitPretty sure those were the exact things that Cook actually did.yea cook was the supply side guy.People certainly love wasting money.I no longer like either of those phone lines. Just nothing special about either one... Yes...let the butt hurt flow thru you.I have an upgrade ,What should I get the Iphone 6+ or the S6? Ready set go!Neither."
"The only thing Sony's new phones lack is a robust marketing campaign, check out the Z3 and Z3 compact. Incredible handsets."
"They had me at anything more than 1080p on a phone is ridiculous, we're sticking with 1080p and focussing on the longest possible battery life."
"I don't miss all the extra chargers i had to carry when i used Samsungs!If you're used to apple, and have bought a lot of apps on their store, probably stick with the iphone (although check it's not too large for you). If not, go with the S6 or maybe the Note 5.The S6 technically superior in every way. The screen is the best on the market and brightest ,thats a tested fact. And it has the worlds fastest SSD inside, 3-4 times quicker thany any other phone on the market, including Apple. And is the only phone on the market that can pay at ANY terminal, including old magnetic swype ones, that by itself is worth EVERY penny. "
"Overall, its a great phone."
"But if know nothing of phones and you just want to follow the crowd because other people have Apple.. i suggest you buy a iphone.Good. All hail our new Samsung overlords. ITT people learn Apple vs. Android really means Samsung or Samsung. [removed]Then get it replaced.Wait samsung makes chips for apple? Dafuk?And the computer parts for their MacBook's are made the same place Asus products are made.huh just shows how much i know or care about electronics. so just goes to show as long as it does what i need and it is cheap then fuck it i'll take it.Lol. Looks like Apple let the fox into the henhouse."
"didn't Apple sue Samsung? are they doing business now?"
"edit: why downvote? it was a legitimate question. Lawsuits are part of business, even between companies that are working together.They've been doing business this entire tiem.so they do business and sue each other?"
"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/31/apple-sues-samsung-for-2bn.....yep? You post that link like people are completely unaware of Apple's anti-competitive lawsuits."
"Apple pushing music labels to kill free Spotify streaming ahead of Beats relaunch[deleted]this this this!"
"i used to torrent A LOT.  It was annoying at same time, because i was so behind on new music.  But i torrented anyway, because well, i couldn't find an alternative.  Then someone introduced me to spotify and I haven't looked back.  Please don't take that away from me.What? New music comes out illegally the day it comes out legally, if it hasn't been leaked already.But you cant just open spotify in browser and hit play during work. Torrenting takes a bit more effort. "
"I listen to spotify when I go to work, work, leave work and same thing with gym after work. I aint gonna start torrenting when I get home in the evening if I could just open an app and hit play.s/he might be referring to the discover and related artists sections, among others, that can be used within spotify to stumble upon new music.I just get rid of apple all together by having an android phone and using google play music, which is awesome by the way.There will probably be a free option with Beats Music, Apple just wants to be the only one offering it.Which is weird, because Apple fought the music industry so hard to make all iTunes music DRM free. Ehh... By the time apple did it it was a moot point. They were one of, if not the, biggest music store online. I'd say it was a pretty big deal to get iTunes to DRM free. It made me go from never buying downloaded music to iTunes being my primary store. Were you not aware that DRM-free music was already available on Amazon and often for less money than iTunes?Sadly, I was not. Most of my music is in iTunes. I'm looking pretty hard at transitioning since Amazon offers it's cloud service. Still, if I want all my music up there it's yet another fucking monthly fee which just isn't going to happen. >Still, if I want all my music up there it's yet another fucking monthly fee which just isn't going to happen."
"I don't buy music anymore, but I preferred to buy it from Amazon.  As for storing it, I always used Google Music, which will store up to 50,000 songs for you for free.Google Play Music is awesome in so many ways. I still buy my music from a variety of sources (itunes for obscure foreign music, amazon and google for other stuff), but listen to it almost exclusively through either google play or my mp3 player (which I use when exercising).Thanks for the tip!They fought so hard Amazon did it before them.Export Spotify playlist > Convert it to YouTube playlist > use one of the bajillion websites out there that rips audio from YT videos. Tada!Yeah do they not remember the original iTunes which was successful be a use everybody had unlimited songs from napster? It's not really any different now. You can torrent the fuck out of new albums and import them into iTunes (and iTunes Match) and it will all work just fine. Apple doesn't give a fuck where you originally sourced the music-files from. Because. He was trying to say because. Apple doesn't realize this...they think since it's them behind the service people would rather use it than pirate..The thing is, given Apple's cult following, they may be right for some people.Exactly. I haven't illegally downloaded music once in the 3 years that I've had spotify. I've even bought songs I couldn't find on Spotify because I've saved so much money on most the of the music I listen to by using spotify that I am happy to pay for the songs I can't get through the service.  As soon as I lose my easy access to music, I'll probably start stealing my music again.  "
"It might rub people the wrong way that I demand easy access to my music, but there is no reason to make music hard to obtain nowadays... unless you're like Wu-Tang and never want your fans to hear your album because ART IS RARE AND BEAUTIFUL, AND MUSIC IS ART SO MUSIC SHOULD BE RARE. 100% this. I haven't torrented a single album since I got spotify premium 4 years ago. I feel like less of a piece of shit and sleep better at night. However, I'm not above going back if they fuck this up for me. I go to enough live music to go back to rationalizing that shit. What kills me is that none of these companies seems to give a shit about radio, where they don't even really get compensated based on the number of plays the song gets, it's just a set monthly or yearly fee.Radio plays the songs that big corps want them to play. They pay the radio stations to get airplay for certain songs a certain number of times a day. You might hear a single that they are pushing played every 40 minutes or so. The main reason they have gone after streaming services and filesharing is that other music acts get the customer's money rather than the music that gets pushed by the record companies. More money is spent on media today than before filesharing. The corps are just upset that their former advertising strategies do not work as well as they used to so the big corps get a smaller chunk of the money people spend on music and other media.So, how do we all become radio stations?Streaming can be done by anyone with an internet connection. The fact that streaming is harder for the record companies to control is why they go after streaming services for money but they pay radio stations to play certain songs they want to advertise.Serious question?"
"You have to pay a licensing fee to the RIAA and to the FCC. And you need to get the radio equipment."
"That's pretty much it."
"I guess technically, you can skip the FCC if you are broadcasting via the internet, but you'll need to check the rules on that one.If you don't want to play RIAA associated music you can avoid them as well.  >You have to pay a licensing fee to the FCC"
"Not if the low-power FM range is under 200 ft!  Take that, Apple!  Of course at that power, it's basically just a garage door opener.  "
"Alternatively, you could set up a Carrier Current Station (a.k.a. Campus Radio), operating between AM 535 and 1705 kHz.  I don't know what's easier - dealing with FCC regulations or setting up your own school so you can broadcast.  "
"South Harmon Institute of Technology - let's make it happen!I would pirate 100% of my music if Spotify was killed. I tried iTunes and Apple's services for a length of time and absolutely hated it. Nothing against people who use Apple for their music, but it is not for me. "
"Edit: A lot of people have mentioned Amazon/Google streaming services as an alternative, gonna give Google's a second lookDo you own an Android device?  Google Play Music All Access is pretty good from my experience with it.  It also ties in very well with other Google/Android features. Same. Paid spotify subscriber for 3 years. I'd go back to what.cd so quick. itunes is a terrible service, thats probably part of it.Seriously, do Apple fans even like iTunes? I can't imagine anyone liking it. I've used it consistently for years now, and have had very few problems. Why is it people hate it so much anyways? One of the primary reasons I use it exclusively is that I have no access to wifi at work and so I need to have hard copies of my music on my phone if I don't want absurd cellular data charges.One of the only reasons I used it was because I used an ipod and at the time didn't realize how ridiculous the album/song files are set up.  After I attempted to transfer my own personal music to a different PC that I purchased in CD form and it was all in thousands of gibberish files and folders I pretty much quit using anything apple.  Thank god I can just use my phone as an mp3 player nowadays, and if I could go back in time I would have told my younger self to buy a zune or some other mp3 player with a music playing program that doesn't use crippling DRM on music you purchased as it's default setting.The DRM has since been removed from iTunes music, but their organization is still bullshit. It's all just far too fiddly for someone that should just be a music purchasing option and music player.I've got an iPhone, MacBook Pro, and an iMac and I HATE iTunes. My brother who would be considered an apple cult member doesn't even like it. I eat drink and poop apples. My relatives on my fathers side are all apples. (Mothers side is more of a mixed fruit bowl) And I hate using itunes."
"Seriously why can't there be better integration with Amazon music like in my previous HTC android. Stupid iOSAnother problem is even if such practices by the big companies are deemed illegal, they just throw money at it.That's because it's so goddamn easy to buy legislation.They make 5 billion and get fined 5 million. Yeah that'll teach 'em!I wonder how serious their problems would actually be if they stopped throwing money at stuff.If the car industry is any example, the government will just throw money at the problem for them.Throw money at me! Get a government contractThis is just Netflix vs cable & Hollywood all over again."
"Is that over with now?Not really, Netflix had to shift towards more of their own programming as fewer companies are letting them buy their content.And netflix's content is, in general, better than most of the rest. A large part of that is due to the creative freedom afforded by not having to abide by broadcast decency rules. "
"You could make that argument for HBO, showtime and cinimax for the past 20 years. While they have traditionally had good content I wouldn't say it is on par with recent HBO shows (GoT silicon valley etc..) Or Netflix originals. No I think the reason that Netflix orginal content is so much better than traditional TV is because the writers/cast/story can remain consistent throughout the series. The writers/directors know the show can be watched in order and they don't have to worry about commercial breaks. Netflix also has the advantage on getting the whole season written before the first episode airs so if something needs to change it can change. "
"Tdlr: There are many obstacles to great story telling, decency restrictions is one of them. But IMHO it's not the one in play here.HBO definitely had great programs before now. The Sopranos, The Wire, Tales from the Crypt, Deadwood, Rome, and Carnivale were all great shows.Dont forget Curb!"
"And Entourage!Bloodline. Watch it people.I've heard it begins slowly, can you give me some opinions on why I should commit(Seriously, I love TV and need something new)Because you love TV and need something new sounds like good enough reason to me.Agreed. It sucks that they have to go on random cleanses of old shows they can't come to licensing terms with, but if more shows like Daredevil come out of it then I'm fine with that.Just started this series. Good stuff.Just finished it tonight! Amazing!Is all of it out or will there be more seasons?Not only will you get a new season of Daredevil next year, you're on track for at least one new Marvel Netflix show this year (AKA Jessica Jones, which will also include Luke Cage) and possibly a second (Iron Fist, which is still listed as a 2015 release although no date has been set). "
"Next year you will get at least S2 of Daredevil and Luke Cage's headlining series, and sometime (probably 2017), all four named heroes will join together in an Avengers-like team-up series called Defenders, who are sort of the street-level heroes that support the Avengers. "
"If Marvel and Netflix can continue the quality level set by Daredevil, I might actually be more excited for the Netflix series than I am for the movies, which seem to be generally following a trend of getting better with each iteration.More to come! Well, Netflix did end up paying extra which proves that comcast is using its monopoly power. The new Net neutrality rules will help if they can be enforced. Those rules will probably also lead to more competition in the ISP space at which point the big incumbents will have less illegal leverage.ISP competition is heavily inhibited by laws Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon helped pass in many states which make it nearly impossible to start a publicly owned ISP. For example, in Virginia, any publicly owned ISP has to pay back its infrastructure costs in the first year (which is inherently impossible) or it has to be shut down. [Read up on all the BS here](http://www.muninetworks.org/content/level-playing-field-0).the same infrastructure costs that we gave 2 billion in tax breaks to the major ISPS so they could build theirs?good thing in europe they would get fined to death. antitrust in europe. . no way. even google gets fined for using its power. but not everybody gets netflix :'(VPN?

"Apple is now firmly in the realm of 90s microsoft. Making stupid choices and threats to get their way. Apple has been doing some shady business for awhile now. They were [price fixing](http://iphone.appleinsider.com/articles/14/07/16/apple-settles-ebook-price-fixing-complaint-with-states-consumers-could-pay-450m) ebooks with publishers and screwing consumers out of lower prices. And Microsoft is now the one making innovation, wow how times have changed...It's as if we actually need antitrust enforcement Yeah Microsoft is making some really good moves with open source, cross-platform C# and Windows 10. Pretty excited with their direction.That, and the surface pro series is an incredible step forward in portable computing. I recently bought a 3, and the battery life, magnetic keyboard and touch screen functionality are fantastic. They're not the only ones making progress in the area but I'm very impressed with what they've producedI'm hoping the Surface Pro 4 will be announced relatively soon because I've been thinking about making the change from my laptop.  Since I built a desktop PC about a year ago I only rarely use my laptop anymore, but I do still use my Nexus 7 relatively often despite the fact that I regret not going with a tablet with a larger screen.  I think a Surface would be a perfect middle ground between the twoA couple of years ago this would have been a great one linerHEY GUYS, THIS GUY ACUALLY READ THE ARTICLE! LOLBURN THE WITCH!HE TURNED US INTO A NEWT!Focused more on numbers than on innovation. It's a shame. Meanwhile Microsoft is releasing tools that make it easy to run Android/iOS apps on Windows, innovating hardware like the Surface Pro 3 and HoloLens, and giving Windows 10 upgrades for free. It seems the pendulum is swinging.To be fair, Microsoft has always had a MASSIVE R&D budget.  "
">During fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, research and development expense was $9.8 billion, $9.0 billion, and $8.7 billion, respectively. These amounts represented 13%, 13%, and 14%, respectively, of revenue in each of those years.  "
"[Investor Report](http://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar12/financial-review/business-description/research-development/index.html)An investment that pays dividends. Which is strange because Apple can afford put so much more money into R&D than they do. They've just been boosting it heavily in the past year or so, but they're still behind.Apple is not a really high tech company, they never spend money on R&D. They are big with marketing. This is the reason their patent number is so pathetic even until recently when they start upping their R&D money.Apple has (or perhaps had, not really sure) some straight up god-tier marketing people.  Their public image really is in all likelihood the single most important factor in their success.  All the extra money that goes into an apple phone/computer/etc. is, in my opinion, largely  resultant of their success in gradually coaxing consumers into believing that their products are inherently more 'high-class' or otherwise valuable than alternatives."
"It actually reminds me a lot of how incredibly expensive diamonds are despite the fact that they really aren't that valuable at all (we can literally create near-perfect diamonds synthetically at this point).  When people are told repeatedly that some given product is nicer/more prestigious they'll begin to value it more regardless of whether or not it provides any tangible benefits or utility.It's almost as if it was a symptom of being too big for your own good."
"Microsoft had to eat a big piece of humble pie between their former glory and where they are today, but I think they are a better company for it."
"Here's to hoping Apple goes in a similar direction.Oddly enough, Steve Jobs talked about this exact thing in an interview.  "
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBma82g3UagIt's the nature of technology. Companies innovate and overtake the market, then are outmaneuvered by smaller more agile competitors and resort to bureaucratic means to maintain their market rather than continuing to innovate. Happened with the telegram companies, then the telephone companies. IBM to Microsoft to Apple. It'll happen to Google as well. The question is if the company can survive their downswing. If Windows 10 is successful, MS can find themselves back in a very good position.Apple already went this direction. The company all but imploded for their closed-minded business philosophies in the past. Before those iMac commercials came along they were as insignificant as they'd ever been. It seems they are going back to their old habits.And no jobs here to save them now.Or Bill for that matter >_>Bill is now back to working part time at MicrosoftIn the mailroom. From the ground up!Jack Donaghy style.Pretty much, except now they're big enough to not suffer from it, at least for the time being. But also no Steve Jobs to come back and save them....I hope not. Spotify is single handedly responsible for me not torrenting music these days. I'd hate to lose that.I was like that with grooveshark.. I guess Spotify is swirling down the drain next?Grooveshark actually had questionable features that caused it to be shut down. Very interesting streaming service, but it was nowhere as professional as Spotify, nor as situated.Grooveshark was the reason I discovered and bought a lot of very obscure music Spotify doesn't have.Still not as legally situated at all. Just because they had access to these bands that didn't put their own music on spotify (which you can do), doesn't mean it wasn't in a position to be shut down. Spotify is what stops a lot of people from pirating music. If you don't provide a free alternative, people will turn to piracy. There are actually a number of studies linking piracy to availability/convenience and pricing.  "
"It turns out people are willing to pay for conveniently available, fairly priced things.  Who knew?Kinda like Netflix. Tons of people stopped pirating movies/TV shows because they were available on netflix for a reasonably affordable price, good quality and easily accessible.I stopped downloading because Netflix spoiled me with speed. Why should I download and start watching after 10 mins when I can load up Netflix and start watching in seconds? Oh and no hunting around for subtitles.Netflix is amazing, but it hurts me inside that they could be even more amazing by having a complete library of almost every single show ever produced, all at the best possible quality, organized properly, given metadata, subtitles, all available anywhere."
"And they can't due to bullshit from rightsholdersSpotify is just the radio to young people, stop stopping it and try to make more money of it's freeness.Isn't the free service the reason Spotify isn't profitable [Maybe.](http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-05-21/why-spotify-and-the-streaming-music-industry-cant-make-money)"
"> Scale is a magic word for so many cloud-based companies and services, but Beats and Spotify operate differently. Their margins don't improve as they get larger. If Spotify bought the rights to songs for a flat rate, then every subscriber it adds would mean free money for the company. But that isn't what it does. Instead, **it spends a fixed proportion of its total revenue on royalties. So if Spotify doubles its subscriber base, it doubles the amount of money it pays out.**"
"> According to a report published by Generator Research last November, the current business model for streaming music is inherently unprofitable. Andrew Sheehy, the main author of the report, concluded: Our analysis is that no current music subscription service--including marquee brands like Pandora, Spotify, and Rhapsody--can ever be profitable, even if they execute perfectly."
"> The company does say **its contracts are structured so about 70 percent of its revenue goes to royalties.**"
"Licensing is killing their profitability AND artist profits. The big record companies get their money without doing jack shit. Apple is probably trying to use their market power to get lower royalty prices."
"> Apple's interest in Beats is an acknowledgment of the changing times, says Rich Karpinski, a senior analyst at the Yankee Group. Everyone is waiting for Apple to make its move, he says. In some ways this validates the area. Apple declined to comment. The acquisition could tilt the balance of power in several ways. Apple could use its market power to force labels to accept lower royalty rates or entice its customers to subscribe to Beats by pre-installing the app on every device, dropping the price, and promoting it heavily through the App Store.The only ads I get are for spotify premium. It's absurd the ad space being wasted because companies don't get that we are the DJ's now via Spotify and it's the radio with a fee songs followed by an ad.What boggles my mind is when the ads they play are for genres of music I NEVER listen to. Spotify has all of the data around the music I listen to as evidenced by their Year in Review feature.  You would think that they could utilize that data to make their advertising more effective.To be fair in Latvia we have a ton of companies using spotify as an advertising platform.  IIRC even Latvian Railways used it for some of their safety PSAs. So it's not as a barren wasteland as it might seem.True, but I think what Apple wants to do is kill Spotify and co so they can get young people to listen to Apple's new version of the radio.I don't know about you, but I don't want to live in a world where someone else makes the world a better place better than Apple does.I finally understand a reference on Reddit! ^(where is the reference from? :()Silicon Valley.  Very funny show.Silicon Valley!This guy fucks, am I right?!"
"Edit: Holy shit! my first gold, to the person who gave it to me, you fuck the hardest!Lol that guy is something else.Haha i like that this comment is starting to appear all over the internet. You know Russ, I've been known to fuck myself. I don't do apple products so people like me will go back to torrenting like I did and still do. They're just going to fuck themselvesI've been an Apple product user for some time now and a Spotify premium user as well. If Apple were to shut down Spotify, I'd just go back to torrents and not paying for music again. The article is talking about Apple trying to shut down freemium services not premiumI still prefer pandora over apples radio service. "
"Maybe it's just a bias (though pandora seems to mix better), but I love pandora. Still the best radio service. Spotify is good and all if you know what songs you want, but pandora is just a better radio service (imo). Agreed. Pandora still has the best suggestions / exploration. I will forever prefer Songza because humans are really good at putting playlists together.That's why I prefer spotify, mixes normally don't work well for me. I want to control what I listen to. The pandora  algorithm starts to lose quality the farther you go into non mainstream music. It has a hard time with classical and jazz and their subgenres. Also I can pay to not have ads in spotify. I really hate ads between pieces of music, totally kills the vibe and flow. > Also I can pay to not have ads in spotify. "
"You can pay to have no ads on pandora as well."
"Yeah but you can't listen to a specific song. With Spotify you have their whole library plus b sides and singles and if they appeared on a compilation. Plus tour dates. When I 'discover' a band I like I just click to see if they're on tour. "
"The last dozen shows I've been to were bands I would have never even heard of without Spotify. And scrolling (decently timed) lyrics available on a lot of songs.And you can record the timings for lyrics, if they're missing them.Pandora is good if you want to hear everything except the song you typed in. I always thought Pandora was more of a discovery service. So playing the specific song you wanted wasn't the goal and instead, exposing you to new songs similar to the ones you already like.That's exactly how I use it. Whoever says people stop discovering new music after their late 20s or so clearly hasn't tried using Pandora.>Sources also indicated that Apple offered to pay YouTube's music licensing fee to Universal Music Group if the label stopped allowing its songs on YouTube."
"That's some straight up evil shit.Shame on Apple. Spotify figured out music. Move on. Tackle another challenge. Tim Cook, take a page out of Elon Musk's life.I don't understand what this means, can someone explain? Apple are willing to pay Universal the same amount YouTube currently pays them, just to take Universal Music off of YouTube.Jeez, Apple are just a bunch of greedy cunts. I always wondered how they get away with their shit. Been going on for years now. "
"Wasn't Microsoft fined shit loads of money for making IE the default browser, ok completely different, but Apple just trying to crush any competition unfairly. MS got in trouble for installing its own browser as the default on Windows, though users could always change it."
"Apple gets away with making their own browser, email client, SMS client, video call client, calendar, navigation, contacts, camera, photo gallery, etc, etc the default and users *cannot* change any of them to default to something else.  That's just the beginning though, since they also control all the hardware *and* the only app store.  They also control the largest source of content, and make it difficult or impossible to retain access to purchased content without continuing to buy their hardware.  No other company has ever had it so good."
"How? By being by far the most profitable company in the business, but technically not having a monopoly if you count users.  "
"For instance, this analysis showing that Apple's not monopoly is taking 93% of all profits from the mobile space:"
"http://m.barrons.com/articles/BL-TB-46610"
"Which is worse for consumers?  Which is more anticompetitive?  Seems clear to me that Apple is doing more harm than MS ever dreamed of during its most powerful days.That would hurt the labels more than anyone, I would think.  YouTube is... kinda popular.This is idiotic. Using the free version made me realize how much I liked the service. That turned me into a paid subscriber. I doubt I would have used it had there not been a free model. Guess it's back to piracy :3I never left.Hoist your colors![never shall we die](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-VoJvbTzk)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ju_10NkGY[Now with 100% more Scottish metal.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXoZsgNHquM)[Lime be the color for me!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAp0xO-LwFs)[Yarr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBH4g_ua5es)Yo ho! You are a pirate!This is so anti-competitive. Just like what they did with eBooks, this is so wrong.The article is actually about the doj and eu antitrust investigation that's going on because of it. "
"And because of the ebook thing,which they were found guilty of antitrust violations from, they have an antitrust monitor on campus which makes this move even dumber because they are going to be getting copies of literally every communication by executives to make sure they aren't pulling more bullshit. What did they do with ebooks? I think he's talking about [this](http://iphone.appleinsider.com/articles/14/07/16/apple-settles-ebook-price-fixing-complaint-with-states-consumers-could-pay-450m). Apple apparently inflated their prices a while back.They were found guilty of orchestrating the [price-fixing of ebooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Apple_Inc.) by having publishers set their own prices on the Apple bookstore (with Apple taking their usual 30% cut) while also requiring that they not be sold anywhere else for less. This was in the interests of publishers, who disliked Amazon discounting their ebooks and wanted to increase consumer prices. There's an appeal, I believe. I really miss the period between when I got my Kindle and when the iPad came out.  I could try lots of books for only a few dollars each.  Then this Apple thing came out and ebooks cost as much as print copies.http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/07/16/apple-settles-ebook-price-fixing-complaint-with-states-consumers-could-pay-450mThey colluded with publishers to prevent Amazon from offering deep discounts. "
"They are part of the reason that the price of books published through the big publishers are the same for ebook and paper.Though to be fair. In that game, everyone made an ass of themselves. Amazon for possible predatory pricing although they maintain it was loss leading. Apple for colluding and the publishers for telling apple to make the collusion happen because they couldn't get it together themselves[deleted]Yes, it is."
"I love my macbook, but I really hate Apple's business tactics.Then stop giving them your money. I hate apple, I envy their product design and quality  but I hate apple tactics.I hate my macbook. And I hate apple. [deleted]It's the fact that it's UNIX that I find Macs easier to deal with. I use a Windows machine for work and I hate it. Each to their own though I guess at least you haven't just slagged them off without using one for an extended period of time.Macs are more user friendly because everything not user friendly is hidden so deep you wont accidentally stumble upon it and be confused. Which for me has always been a pain in the ass cause I have always been above avg computer savy on a PC, but I cant stand my Mac.It's another os, some things are better, some worse."
"I enjoy it.I walk in both worlds, I'm a windows SA at work, and all mac at home. Sure Mac has it's quirks, but overall, it's a better experience. I've had friends/family I recommended switch over, and they've stopped constantly asking me to help them or fix their computers. "
"Just my experience, but I do get that sentiment of them being easier because I've seen it.It's simple like a unix os (it is a unix os), but has the applications that windows has. It also doesn't come loaded with a ton of shit that dell, hp, etc PCs come with."
"I know ~~people~~ /r/pcmasterrace are going to say well idiots should make their own computers but the truth is a lot of people don't and don't want to.  Know your consumer, don't try to change your consumer.Representative of /r/pcmasterrace here. Idiots should buy a far better, cheaper laptop from MSI, ASUS, or even RAZR. Starbucks regulars might beg to differ, but Apple aren't the only, nor the best makers of laptops.But the same reason a person buys a macbook is the kind of the same reason someone buys designers bags rather than a random bag.  (not saying that's a good reason to do something, but millions of people do it)"
"Personally, for most of my internet usage I prefer a chromebook.  Cheap as fuck, gets the job it was created for done.Props for the Asus suggestion. Have a touchscreen asus laptop and its badass and cost a fraction of mac priceI personally just bought the new Dell XPS 13 and I couldn't be happier. Only bloat that came on it was McAfee anti virus that was easily uninstallable.As someone who is pretty tech-capable, I enjoyed my 2009 MacBook Pro simply because it was less buggy. I never had any actual issues with it, unlike every single Windows OS computer I have ever used, and the battery life was far superior (at the time at least) to the Windows OS laptops on the market. Now that my MacBook is finally slowly dying, I think I'm going to switch to a Chromebook. But the reasons Macs are easier is just that they are less prone to issues that Windows OS computers have. And even though those issues are sometimes easily fixable if you know what you're doing, it's still easier to not have them in the first place.Woot for Chromebook. Does the one thing really, really well for cheap.Which issues specifically are you talking about? It's been years since I've had any problems with windows.Disagree. In my experience, Macs have a sweet spot that's pretty consistent whereas windows pcs tend to have a shorter sweet spot that can vary significantly based on who you're buying from, what model, and when. That's not at all to say that there aren't issues, just that they tend to show up later and are often fairly common, impossible to fix, and pretty blatantly ignored by apple. I've sent back HPs that crapped out on me, and they tended to know what the issue was for the product line but every problem I've ever encountered on a mac (or had a friend experience) has been typical enough to find a ton of hits on google, no official response, and every bit as annoying as windows problems. Add on that Apple makes it significantly harder to do any fixes yourself (hardware or software) and I've had a lot more frustration from their products."
"I'd also add that they're not really easier. They do the same things differently, and my parents are just as clueless about how to use their iPhones as they were on android, but due to marketing would never go back to android because it's too difficult.On that note. For any Macbook Pro owners who have faulty GPUs on 2011-2013 models, Apple [finally just acknowledged](https://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro-videoissues/) their motherboard issue and will now replace them. I work in the tech field and I was literally at the Apple store getting a Macbook Pro serviced the week before they announced this and I asked about the issue since one of the users I supported had it. They pretended to have never heard of the issue when I brought it up. This! god damn, a million times this.Try using them in an enterprise environment.  We took the Mac's away from everyone except the CEO, with the caveat that we will do nothing to support it.  Then some asshole bought apple TV's...There's nothing to support on an Apple TV. It's either on the network or not."
"To get them on WPA2 enterprise a configuration file must be created and managed with a Mac.  We don't have one and there are no other options.  To get content on them we want, we would have to dedicate a seperate machine to provide it. From the google searches i have done, the consensus is unless your network is already set up with apple devices in mind, best to look elsewhere.The thing I hate about my macbook is that I have a $2200 pro with great specs and it can't run a ten year old game smoothly (vanilla wow).Spotify is a godsend."
"Ffs...I'd pay $20 for my Spotify if I knew $10 of it was used to somehow fuck Apple.Good guy apple - using their massive warchest to stifle competition at every turn. Should we innovate this quarter? Nah, lets rip off someone else's idea - we're good at that.Apple is no saint, and while I enjoy their products, I am no fanboy...but ripping off others ideas? They may not have invented *everything* that goes into their products, but they have been at the forefront (often leading the charge) of nearly every major tech trend of the past 15 years.PC's, phones, music players and iTunes are not even close to nearly every major tech reel it in there fanboyWell that's exactly it. They take existing, newish technology and package it in a sneak and sexy way, then market it better than any one else. I'm not trying to bash them. Marketing is much harder to do than people give it credit for. And without Apple I think a lot of mainstream tech would still be considered niche and unimportant. That has caused everyone to innovate. So while I don't believe Apple is always directly pushing the envelope, they are usually shoving someone else into it. No they haven't. "
"They've been at the forefront of *refining* every tech trend in the past 15 years, but they've honestly pretty much never innovated anything. "
"They're amazing at marketing and they're good at making a super polished product that either a 9 year old or an 89 year old can use without issue. .. they're not so good at inventing. SSDs? Late to the game. USB3? Late to the game. Graphics options for laptops and desktops (nVidia/AMD), constantly late to the game. "
"The iPhone and iPad are simply iterations and design refinement of what were (long) existing ideas and technology. They leveraged their market position as a premium brand to be able to sell as very expensive product which gave them enough profit margin to actually make a good product (but again, at a fairly high price). They've ripped of every successful technology they've innovated on in the last 10 years, but that's pretty common practice. It was all existing technology, what I will give you, is that they are brilliant at packaging existing technologies and giving them market appeal. Brilliant design and marketing departments.I think they're really good at taking emerging technologies and apply them in such a way that they become mainstream. The research on multi-touch, taptic feedback, the friggin computer mouse was all started externally, but Apple took those things and built products in which those things truly shine. It's not just about marketing and 'visual' design, it's about design in it's broadest sense.[deleted]Or they just buy it.[deleted]To be fair, Apple never really innovated. They take an existing idea and 'perfect' it. "
"The iPod was a really awesome mp3 player. Smartphones existed before the iPhone. Tablet computers, portables, regular computers,...If you release something that redefines its category, I think it's pretty reasonable to call it an innovation.Yep, they just pull parts of the shelves, wrap it up in nice packaging and sell their overpriced garbage.This is a type of innovation, but not technological. They innovate in product design and user experience, but not new technologies. They buy technologies and make them accessible.Good point, I hadn't looked at it that way. This, the only thing Apple is even good at doing. "
"I like the macbook air and their phone(even though they're becoming shit, the iphone 6 is such a disappointment to me) because they're beautifully designed and they're not things that I specifically need to be powerful, just to look nice.Well, this, branding, marketing, and advertising. They are REALLY good at positioning their products. The best even.Wait are you implying they didnt come up with a rectangle with rounded corners?[deleted]Apple usually buys a 'Spotify' before it gets to big and calls it innovation.Apple's best bet is to buy Spotify, which dear god, please don't do.They sure have the cash for it though[deleted]> What don't they have cash for?"
"Enough advertising to make me buy an iPhone.>Hell, they can even afford to buy my unconditional love"
"Except Apple is clever enough to make you pay huge margins to love them unconditionally!Shhh...don't give them ideas. Fuck Apple and fuck Beats, especially Beats in Avengers: Age of Ultron and Transformers: Age of Extinction. Their shit is getting annoying as hell.Heh. That was my first thought. Tony Stark couldn't make a better pair of headphones, and wants to risk it all to a pair of shitty Beats?That was Bruce Banner for you.Bruce is not an audiophile, but... classical music on a pair of bass-laden headphones... =PThis only encourages people to go back to piracy. Alternatively I would pay spotify or Google music double what I would pay apple for the same service. f those guys.I mean, Spotify's only $10/month as it is. If they killed off the free service, hardcore cheapskates would pirate, but I think most people can stand to pay 33C/ a day for an incomprehensibly large library. "
"Look how big Netflix is, and they don't even have a free tier. "
"Edit: someone spent $4 on me? Cool!While I partially agree (I'm a Spotify Premium user myself), I feel like a big part of it would be the loss of an existing free service that would damage Spotify."
"Netflix never had a free service initially, and I feel like that makes a big difference here. If Spotify goes full-pay, it would instantly lose 3/4 (if I read the article right) of its userbase, and that'd be damning.Also, PS5/mo for students!Fuck Apple. Good thing Spotify isn't the only free music streaming service.Well we just lost GrooveShark so they start working on the bigger fish like Spotify.I wonder if they had anything to do with Grooveshark going down.No, Grooveshark has been in litigation with the RIAA and labels for years, and was truly illegal in the sense that they were literally hosting and streaming pirated content, and did little to nothing to respond to DMCA requests. If I really have to I'll go back to Google play. Good luck taking that one out Apple.I ditched iTunes for Play a while ago.I love Google Play's subscription service. Good for discovery and great quality. Plus being able to upload my own music and pin music for listening offline is great.I gave Google play a month a couple months a go (as a long time spotify user) and I wasn't impressed. I'm curious why you like it more than spotify, if you don't mind me asking? I have had them both and stuck with play primarily because I could upload all my music to it. Music discovery is better on Spotify, but I have other means anyway."
"The real killer feature of play now though is YouTube music pass. IMO it puts play far ahead of any other streaming service. There is so much fucking content on YouTube, beyond just music. The ability to stream all that and save it for offline listening is unbeatable.Can't wait for the headlines that come out (like every Apple launch) saying how they *revolutionized the (streaming music/messaging/payments/etc) world* like other companies and projects in the space haven't been doing the same thing for years.  Sad thing is people eat this shit up and continue to buy their products.Just like they revolutionized the smart watch :oThey revolutionized the price...in the wrong direction...And NFC payment.I always find it interesting how big artists and powerful labels complain how they are not receiving their fair share when people listen to their music on Spotify either through a premium account or as a free user.  What about the artists that are impossible to find in a music store?  Impossible to find even if one wanted to go buy a 100 CDs every single day?  I have found so much new music since starting to use Spotify, and most of the the new music has less than 5000 plays with the artist only have a few hundred followers.  These are artists I wouldn't even be able to find using illegal methods."
"Surely these non mainstream artists are seeing a benefit of having their music on Spotify.  "
"Imagine a day where artists would directly release their music to Spotify and bypass having a label altogether.  What's a free market without a little anti-competitive leveraging from corporate giants?I doubt it takes any convincing. Look at what happened with Taylor Swift."
"It's clear the labels feel that big-deal record releases should be release windowed like movies are. That means not being on all-you-can eat streaming (like Spotify or Youtube) at release.Now's your chance, Microsoft. Buy Spotify, and tell Apple to suck it.Microsoft Zune Music Streaming.But also, please don't.Long live Spotify!I will not switch streaming providers. I'm a premium Spotify user now, but if it becomes a big exclusive shit storm I will simply go back to pirating music and nobody will get my money, and I don't think I'm alone. I really hope that it doesn't become a big exclusive shitstorm, the only reason that music streaming works is that everything is available in one super convenient package. If they remove that, then (like you said) everybody will just go back to pirating everything.  This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/4/8540935/apple-labels-spotify-streaming) reduced by 70%. (I'm a bot)"
"*****"
"> The Verge has learned that Apple has been pushing major music labels to force streaming services like Spotify to abandon their free tiers, which will dramatically reduce the competition for Apple&#039;s upcoming offering."
"> Apple has been using its considerable power in the music industry to stop the music labels from renewing Spotify&#039;s license to stream music through its free tier."
"> Getting the music labels to kill the freemium tiers from Spotify and others could put Apple in prime position to grab a large swath of new users when it launches its own streaming service, which is widely expected to feature a considerable amount of exclusive content."

Simple as that.Didnt they try and do the same thing with Ebooks?They didn't just try, they succeeded :(Apple has become worse than Microsoft.  OK...Correct me if I'm wrong, but how can they differentiate between the freemium and paid users? Yes, one is funded by ad revenue and the other by subscription fee, but in the end Spotify still pays the same licensing fees for all of the plays. I have never seen anything saying that spotify pays a different licensing for the free, ad revenue, users. So if that is the case, then how could anyone target just that tier of service?Apple sure loves competition. And grooveshark just shut..."
"This seems like an amazing coincidence...You can divide my life into two parts: when I pirated music and when I started paying for Spotify. I'd really hate to go back to my old ways. Apple declined to comment"
"Does Apple EVER comment?Glad the DOJ is looking into this, it seems like Apple usually gets a free pass when they do stuff like this to try to create a monopoly like they did with iTunes. What about iTunes is or was a monopoly? I seem to have missed this.iTunes **still** has a de facto monopoly on digital music sales, sales of individual tracks and albums. About 90% of sales are iTunes (Amazon MP3 is #2 with around 5%). Sales have gone down in recent years (physical CD sales have been steady) to the point where digital sales aren't much better than physical CD sales now. "
"Spotify is a streaming service treated like radio, you don't *own* anything on Spotify, Pandora, etc. "
"I was [referring to this](http://money.cnn.com/2014/12/16/technology/apple-antitrust-trial) Apple is going full fucking retard with this one.Just to provide another perspective on the issue:"
"Free tiers on Spotify and other streaming services are a joke. They pay next to nothing - it's all in micro pennies. Why would labels agree to such a terrible payout? Because Spotify and Youtube give them advances (hundreds of millions of dollars) to make it hard to say no. Once they have the big labels, it's only a matter of time before the little ones follow."
"Artists only make realistic earnings from streaming services when a Paid Subscriber streams the song. And the crazy part is that the Paid Subscriber model is totally sustainable. An independent musician could actually make a living on it."
"Free tiers aren't sustainable for any party, and that's why Netflix has never had one. It's no better than piracy. Taylor Swift pulled her music off Spotify because she only wanted it on the premium service. But Spotify said it's all or nothing, and so she pulled everything."
"I personally pay the $10 for Spotify and think it's totally worth it. I see this move by Apple as trying to help move an unsustainable model to a sustainable one."
"Source: I worked at Sony and did a lot of number crunching analysis on streaming. Now I'm a full-time independent musician. I know both sides.Spotify blows anything Apple has out of the water, and I hope Spotify prevails in this.Apple, I want you to go home tonight, put on some soft music, light a few candles...maybe even lay a blanket out on the floor...then GO FUCK YOURSELF.How is this not totally illegal? Anti trust?"
"You can't use your dominant position in Itunes to force others to bend to your will like that.  "
"I thought the DOJ sued Microsoft over just this crap? If you have to kill someone else's product in order for your product to work, your product sucks.sources say, so lets not assume anything before we get some confirmation, hope you guys didn't forget that fabricated bendgate already.My irrational hatred of Apple is now slightly less irrational. Seriously fuck them.People buying Apple's overpriced gadgets give this company this power. You all earned it.I WILL NEVER USE BEATS. Apple... bunch of cunts. -Sandor CleganeThese companies are so full of greed they don't see that they're creating their own downfall.  "
"I'm not gonna pay for more than one streaming service, and if you chose to not be a part of that, then you won't get any of my money. Simple stuff.  "
"The same goes for movie-streaming devices. I will gladly pay for the one with the best library, and download everything else I want to see.  "
"Want my money? Stop being a greedy fuck. I don't support millionaires who needs a bigger pool or more cars.More reasons to hate Apple. I wish the 12 year olds and hipster retards would wake up and smell the corruption.Evil Apple strikes again. Soon enough, the entire music industry will get itself pigeonholed into their little walled garden and we will be forced to buy Apple products to listen to music. Ridiculous. Yet another reason why I hate Apple as a companyFuck Apple, back to torrenting music again i guess. Way to go Apple.  Keeping things fair since....PSA, if you have Amazon Prime you get a spotify like service for free which has a ton of contentThe content is not up to the level of Spotify's.Yeah everything bundled with Amazon prime is pretty mediocre, instant video has some cool shoes though "
"Edit: I meant shows, but they got cool shoes tooI prefer to buy my cool shoes from normal amazon shopping.> you get a spotify like service for free"
"You mean you get a spotify like service as part of your subscription to Amazon Prime.they don't have the content that spotify has. I find that 70-80% of what I like to listen to either isn't available, or isn't free with the subscription. just like the streaming video service. it's meh at best.There's lots of people who have Amazon Prime and don't even know about this feature, me included until like 2 weeks ago. I don't want to lose something like Spotify. As a consumer, I love that I can look almost any song up that I want to and listen to it for 5 bucks a month. As a musician and someone who make a living off of music, I hate that Spotify treats artists like their music is worthless. What I would rather have happen would be to reform Spotify so that they pay more for these music licenses/royalties. I'd even be willing to pay a few dollars a month more for it too.More reason not to buy digital multimedia.Kill the competition. Gotta recoup the costs of wasting money on Beats...Apple is worse than Microsoft has ever beem. Been saying it for years, but this is quite vindicating.Looks like Apple wants to be broken up. Time for the Anti-Monopoly suites to come out.*Apple offered to pay YouTube's music licensing fee to Universal Music Group if the label stopped allowing its songs on YouTube*"
"I've loved Apple for so long but they have become the very thing they set out to free us from. How is this even legal. Hey Google I will pay you my competitors ad rate if you promise you won't print their ads anymore? Would that go over without legal intervention? Hell no. I know it's not an apples to apples example but it just blows my mind to lose a huge swath of music videos from Youtube when I know I would never be a beats customer. So for me and most others, it's a net loss. Fair commerce now!Apple scumbagsThis is all Trent Reznor's fault. Not a fan of this. This is the wrong way to compete. That's cable tactics.Kind of funny though, Apple is touted as being revolutionary but more often than not they're the second mover a majority of the time I remember a time when all these kind of articles were about Microsoft. I guess absolute power does corrupts absolutely.Well either Spotify keeps a free tier or I go back to pirating it and fuck you Apple.The most powerful bulling the rest for supremacy, nothing new. Especially in the US.I know Apple and the labels wont read this but they should."
"I will absolutely 100% quit paying for Spotify, I will not pay for Beats, and I'll go back to pirating things (super easy, relatively guilt-free!) and the entire music industry can go fuck itself if they want to do this exclusive nonsense. "
"It might take a lot of effort to trickle down to the artists I like on a regular basis, but putting it back out of reach just means I won't bother paying anything anymore.  Period.    I'm not going to cave in to Apple bullying anyone around.  The labels shouldn't either.   It's in their best interest to be on every single service at the same time forever with as much stuff as they possibly can provide at all times.   Apple we can't make service which can compete so we will throw money at the problem and see if it fixes itself.And these would be the same labels that [won't let Apple lower the price of the Beats service](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/26/technology/apple-and-beats-developing-streaming-music-service-to-rival-spotify.html?_r=1) would they."
"I suspect there is more to this story.[deleted]bad move. Apple iTunes is what stopped me from pirating music. I've moved on and am using a more cost effective way to consume with rdio. If they bully that away, I would go back to torrent and direct purchase.  Fuck Apple.I'm not buying your stupid Beats. They suck ass and are too expensive, just like every product you put out now.More reasons for avoiding crap from asswipe dre and appleThe apple streaming service would probably stream in 32Kbps and require beats shitphones This is ~~why~~ one reason I hate Apple.I would rather go buy a CD from a store than use iTunes/Apple.fuck apple. just fuck them.Blatant violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.  What the fuck is the DOJ waiting for?  "
"Edit: To clarify the violation: They are facilitating anti-competitive practices that force the consumers to buy proprietary devices in order to listen to music they once had access to at a much lower cost.  Even without the devices the cost of the music itself goes up as well. So not only is it dangerous to market competition it goes against the best interests of the consumers.I'll never buy any music from Apple as long as I live. If they become the only place to buy music I would cut my ears off just to spite them. Fuck them. Do you remember when you cried when Steve Jobs died? He wouldn't have cried if he were you.Ok, fuck Apple.I'm confused, so Apple will have their ad-supported Apple Radio, paid Apple Radio, paid iTunes Match, and Beats Music?Bring back anti-trust legislation.Time to youtube to mp3 download! I have been using spotify for 4 years now. I built a new computer last month and was stressing out about moving my music from my old MacBook. It was then, that I realized I literally never opened iTunes to listen to music for over about 1000 days."
"I didn't even bother moving all my music over to my new computer.I did this same thing yesterday. Goodbye iTunes, you bloated, illogical piece of shit. You shan't be missed. "
"Secret tip: music.163.com"
"They have everything and you can download it via the player as .mp3. "
"I am not even joking."
"China knows how...This whole investigation has felt really suspect, like the music industry trying to torpedo this service before it comes out. It's the industry that wants spotify and streaming services like it to either die or pay out more and they're still pissed Apple was able to hold them over a barrel after the industry fucked itself with outrageous prices that turned people to piracy. "
"You have artists out there like Taylor Swift and Jay-Z arguing artists aren't making enough off of streaming services and blaming the services rather than the system in the industry designed to funnel more money to middlemen and very little to the artist. "
"Who would benefit from an investigation like this the most? Just follow the money. Tim Cook has taken everything that Jobs built the company to be and turned it into another corporation that tries to stomp out competition instead of innovating. Most of the music I listen to is run by people who would flip off apple, throw a chair in their faces, then run out after shitting on some desks.a) Dick move by Apple, if the rumor is true"
"b) If you like a streaming music service, show your support by paying for it if you are at all able to do so.  _\(also, consider reddit gold, since you're here)_America - Land of the free.> America - Land of the free."
"Typo = America - Land of the fee.Apple really is becoming old MicrosoftApple is always been like old Microsoft.That was my first thought when I saw this.That's fine. I'll just torrent.Because Apple doesn't have enough money yet... Because Apple didn't learn from the last two major antitrust lawsuits. It's the e-book scandal all over again. Greedy much?and I'm just sitting here buying cdsWhen I was your age, [THIS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Records) was what I thought of when you mentioned Apple and music in the same sentence.I really have no comment about iTunes. I have an iphone so I have to use their program to upload stuff. Fine. "
"Coming from android, what I don't like is the segregation of stuff in ios. My primary music purchase place is Amazon or sometimes, I'd just download directly from a site. In any music app on android all music files are displayed and you can pick and choose to make a playlist. For the iphone, I have to create a separate playlist on amazon music, a separate playlist on the ios native app because it won't read any music files but the ones uploaded by itunes. And forget about individual songs downloaded directly from websites.I just recently gave Spotify a chance when the PS4 adopted it as its music service (so that partnership works); I have since signed up for a 2-month Premium trial and couldn't be happier. I essentially have instant access to any song I could want for any mood or occasion, all through my phone."
"I'm in the process of listing and selling my iPod Classic 7th Gen 160gb (PM me if interested, btw) and dropping Sirius XM to make way for a car stereo that supports Bluetooth for wireless Spotify plus Wireless calling (safety first!)"
"Spotify, as a service, is pretty damn sufficient for me. I'm sure, over time, I will find things I don't like about the service, but as a new user, I couldn't be happier. I hope Spotify is able to maintain its model and grow, as I don't want to lose its library and functionality. Soon to be: Apple pushing radio stations to play nothing but NPR, declaring in a statement that The age of free radio is dead, and music is no longer art but a commodity that only the privileged can purchase using new beats audio and apple ipadphonewatchheartsAward for the most obnoxious brands used in a single title goes to.....I have google unlimited music for $10 a month so fuck you apple.Apple is taking away my freedom!!! Why!!??ya I never liked buying itunes back in the day after that i never went back."
"fuck I got a zune later on which at the time had radio over the ipod so it was plus for me and cheaper. still works and been pretty awesome when i use it got music on the zune you can upload it to your computer through the program and have all that music capable of being played on the computer anytime."
"in retrospect wish i got one of the larger zune to hold more music.They tried the same thing with streaming radio and ended up just competing with Pandora and getting no special rates.  I would be surprised if they got any special treatment.Thats a lot of buzz for a rumour starting at the NY Post and the Verge... So far unsubstantiatedwell if they do then i guess our only other choice is piracy and of course youtube I like and use many apple products. "
"But things like this are not ok!"
"I don't identify myself by any of those products and i use them because they work perfect for me. "
"But no company should be able to somehow (try to) change the product line of a different business model. "
"If it's so far and specific companies (like spotify) can't fend(?) themself from apple, apple has a monopol and can nearly do whatever they want."
"This is not good!"
"Until I read this I had never used Spotify,now I love it.Streisand Effect!  This might help Spotify and other Streaming Services to grow even more.You think I made all that money by writing checks? Buy him out, boys.I don't listen to streaming music very much at all but this makes me want to go and buy a Spotify premium account.Ah fuck off Apple, no one cares about your shit.Fuck apple and apple products Apple is turning into a bag of dicks??? They have been for years... Evil knows no boundaries.Spotify Premium has meant that I don't or rarely torrent. The only last album I downloaded was a Tool album because it simply isn't available anywhere else.not in the shop no?Apple and Apple owners really are monsters.The definition of selfish, ignorant, greed.Just remember, this is a rumour. Don't form too strong an opinion with atleast some hard evidence showing proof either way.Apple is a piece of shit company. Another reason I hate AppleFuck Apple.... I got rid of every apple device in the house and have never been happier. you must have a sad life if dumb shit like that makes you happy..Its just like the stunt they pulled with publishers of books."
"Apple needs to compete fairly and quit trying to force others out of business through backroom dealsI guess it's easier to fight competitors rather than offering a better service...I'd be mad, but I never *actually* stopped pirating..."
"Sometimes it's really satisfying to be a scumbag.Apple just really hates having competition. I always did say that apple is just a company full of blind corrupt evil greedy bastardsWell those of us that aren't cheap bastards are already paying PREMIUM spotify memberships anyway, so I think I speak on behalf of us when I say we don't really give a DAMN if you cancel trials or not.Don't they understand that people who listen to music for free aren't going to suddenly start paying you money when you've brought out their free service... Can't wait for Apple to die off.Here we go again Apple thinking they rule the world just because they make a phone that people go bat shit crazy over. Apple could release their own fruit, and the Apple idiots would be queueing up to buy it.Time to go back to pirate bay and vinyl!Thanks for taking away my last reason to pay for music :DApple: *Proprietary is our middle name!*Hey apple, fuck off.Fuck apple directly in Jobs' dead ass. Apple sucksOh hey Apple gave me yet another reason to never support them by buying their shit. I'll add it to the pile.Nah, let's not make a better product let's just try and destroy something people enjoy usingItunes is such a bulky and horrible program.  Everything about it is just a waste. If this happens,  all im going to do is torrent mainstream music.  At least with spotify,  they get something out of me.  "
"Though i think 90% of my music is bought on bandcamp these days.  So much hidden talent.  Thank you for buying on bandcamp. Apple being Apple. Beats and Apple... All marketing zero substance."
"I once bought in the the Apple bullshit, but back then they used the G4 processor and I could believe it was better than anything in a PC. They always showed Photoshop rendering things way faster on the G4. Once they swapped to intel... WTF was the point, I am the biggest Apple hater now... "
"They have not innovated anything in 10 years. Every new revolutionary product is just a copy of something else, but because their consumer base is ignorant to it... It is new to them."
"FUCK APPLEHere is a word cloud of all of the comments in this thread: http://i.imgur.com/3zKqvQ2.png  "
"[^source ^code](http://github.com/Winneon/makeswordclouds) ^| [^contact ^developer](http://reddit.com/user/WinneonSword) ^| [^faq](https://github.com/Winneon/makeswordclouds#faq)I never buy apple products anyway, fuck those guysI hope nobody has forgotten about when Apple bought up Lala, another music streaming service, and essentially shut them down. "
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lala_%28website%29"
"It was my favorite music streaming service. You could buy individual tracks for $0.10 for unlimited streaming. It was completely legal and backed up by record companies. You could of course by the MP3s elsewhere for $1, but streaming is all I ever really wanted so $0.10 per song was amazing."
"Then Apple bought them out, and shut them down just before they were about to release their iPhone app. It all seemed a little anti-competitive to me.Do you want more piracy? Because that's how you get more piracy....Apple wants to get sued again like when they got caught price fixing ebooks? Is Apple really this clueless?  Do they really think they're going to push people off Spotify with something as silly as a Beats relaunch?"
"If the music labels kill off free Spotify, I will cancel my sub and go back to torrenting everything. Do no evil my ass[deleted]But look how responsive the touchscreen is. says every iPhone user ever to distract you from the topic of terrible limitations.Hey fuck you apple, still wont by your hipster products.Man I wish the DOJ and EU would go after these assholes instead of Google. Beats, shitty hardware with an Apple price tag.I'm the biggest Apple Fan boy there is, but fuck off Apple.I'm so sick of corporations that think only they should have the rights to make money off of something they had no hand in creating.It appears the $100,000,000,000 they have saved up isn't sufficient. Greedy bastards. Pour molten gold down their throat if they're so damn hungry for more wealth. when i hear relaunch i think of that burger joint near me thats under new management."
"yeah its still bad.Reason enough to boycott Beats. Refuse to buy and tell 'em why.I sure am glad I pirated my entire 85,000 track library.  I dint have to worry about this shitBack to pirating I guessNo wonder GrooveShark got shut down at the end of April. Now it all makes sense.If the goal is to see a significant increase in pirate downloads, Apple's move is genius. Hello piracy my old friend.Why do companies constantly do this? Can't they recognize when another company has a certain product *figured out* and let it be? Why must all companies want in on the action even when their version of a product is clearly inferior? Spotify has subscription based music streaming on lock, the people like it. Things like Tidal and whatever the hell Apple thinks they're gonna do, are just huge wastes of money and time."
"It would be one thing if they were IMPROVING a product, but they aren't. Some stuff is just awesome as it is. Let it fucking be. I'm not gonna go and start a damn hazelnut buttery spread company cause Nutella pretty much has that shit on lock."
"I get companies want to make money but, fucking hell. This type of practice is just counterproductive and wastes money.Consumers are paying for their very own oppression by supporting Apple in any shape, form, or fashion. They're a greedy company hell bent on taking every last dime you have. **STOP SUPPORTING APPLE**.man fuck apple"
"i pay for spotify "
"fuck you appleBeats are the popular for being overpriced pieces of shit.  This is going to do its image no favors.its 2015, I hope some of you guys figured out that they are bad companies. >Spotify currently has 60 million listeners, but only 15 million of them are paid users.  "
"Only? Most services I know would kill for a 25% conversion rate.If spotify was better I would care. I still have to torrent a lot of music. Apple needs to fuck off, and not touch my Spotify.If Apple just released an affordable attractive service with well done logical features that integrates well into the other services I pay I would switch in a heartbeat.Apple was great for a while, now they are fucking around way too much."
"Their music production apps (Logic X mainly, but there are so many great iPad apps) are the only reasons I still have Apple products. Why would they provide such great avenues for production but hinder the dissemination of the music made with their software?Apple pressuring record labels. Whoever wins, we lose. At least we'll get to gloat for a bit.Another dick move by Apple. They'll do anything to stifle competition."
"I'm not surprised the slightest. It took Apple little no more than 7-8 years for them to expand the iTunes Store in my country so as a Spotify subscriber, I'm potentially losing out on some artists/albums until they introduce their streaming service in the next 7 years or so.Why does Apple try to kill everything I love? :(Fuck you Apple for doing this!There's no way this isn't anti-competitive.Time for the rest of you to stop buying Apple's products.Fuck Apple.Funny how Apple has become the new Microsoft.When will the gatekeepers realize that they are irrelevant? "
"Sound moving through air will be conveniently enjoyed at the lowest possible market price. Thanks to the internet and home recording technology, that price is now virtually zero. "
"Historically, efficiency brought by innovation has always won out over conservative-ism. Humanity has mostly benefited from this process and now will be no different. "
"I love the future, just wish it would hurry up.  "
"Edit: Comma And this boys and girls, is why you should never buy anything from large monopolistic companies known for screwing others over. Like Apple. Big surprise here; I was just thinking how much their iTunes store is losing everyday now that Spotify is the best service on the web."
"Apple is turning into a shit company real fast.  No innovation at all.Apple Watch team puts pressure on clock makers to end the ability to tell time for free.I hate to sound like a Republican but..."
"...there's a fair amount of idealistic naivety here in Reddit.Cool. I already try and avoid giving any money to Apple. Now I can actively go out of my way to avoid it too.Yeah, like that's going to happen lmao.Good luck. They recently just began a partnership with Playstation, which is a part of Sony, the worlds second largest music company.I just hope Spotify continues its Student Discount if this happens.It's always a source says.Some of the comments on that article are... interesting. Quick question, why is it that small musicians need labels?. I can understand that larger artist will benefit from them but what do smaller to midrange artist get from it?.Labels are there for promotion and guidance. If a label believes in your music they with spend thousands if not millions promoting it. But then they own what you produced and have no obligation to pay the artist anymore. The article seems to be totally missing the part where Apple wanted to offer a lower cost tier when the new Beats streaming service starts, but the labels wouldn't let them (unless that proved to be false?)."
"Sounds more like the music labels are the bad guy here, and Apple is just trying to get as many customers as they can by launch, and not turn into Tidal. "
"I'm not necessarily defending Apple or Spotify, but I stopped pirating music because of Spotify, and while I don't mind paying $10 a month, I know a lot of people aren't, and taking away the free options is just going to bring piracy back in full force.Apple kiiilled the raadio starThis kind of thing won't last. Apple should be able to make this a better product. I have both a monthly Spotify subscription and iTunes Match annual. The Beats app is a complete flop. I am hoping they aren't sticking with it.Considering that Grooveshark's farewell message revolved about recommending switching to (here I quote) an affordable, licensed service that compensates artists and other rights holders, I do think that the industry as a whole is aiming towards illegalizing or eliminating free tiers to services.Well at the very least we got some warning this might be coming, didn't hear that Grooveshark was going down until afterwards, had some good playlists I would have liked to get off there...Since Pandora is still awesome, I couldn't care less.man...i have such a profound love/hate relationship with apple.As if I needed another reason never to purchase an Apple device.Hahaha good lucky with that, iphones are a small portion of the worldwide smartphone market I was just looking for the event which recent, brutal and sudden murder of grooveshark would've been the harbinger of.Oh fuck you apple. Now that Grooveshark is no more, this title could read... Apple pushing music labels to make much of their music totally-not-desired, ahead of Beats relaunch."
"As has been said before, a pirated song is (very, very) frequently not a lost sale, but a song that would have been ignored were a cost attached to its acquisition.Back to torrents for me I guessSo wait. If i did understand it correctly it means that i will still keep and be able to play my music if i pay for spotify premium right ? It seems kind of terrible to lose all my playlist's i have made for years.Pfft, YouTube is the best for listening to music.Well Beats sucks anyway.. the headphones and the whatever stuff. And oh gosh the Beats Audio software is shit too."
"It's all shit.. marketing FTW.As someone who recently switched from ios to Android and is in the process of determining which is best for me ( Spotify / Google Play ) , Fuck Apple. I do not miss you.That explains why some artists are dispersing from Spotify. Look at those fuckfac..I mean fine gentlemen I like how they think if all of the free streaming services are done away with, people will just automatically pay Apple for their service.  Think highly of ourselves,  do we?"
"Ever since real to real tapes, people have been getting free music.  Apple isn't going to stop that.  I hope these companies push back against apple. Having had beats for almost a year and then switching back to Spotify I have to say Spotify is WAYYYY better and a hell of a lot easier to navigate and add artists/songs and create offline playlists. NO. FUCK THAT. I like spotify - not just because at $10/mo it's basically free (considering how much I would pay for all of the artists I listen to) but I actually like the UI much MUCH better than the shit apple puts together in iTunes. FUCK beats and the stupid fruit it rode in onI have Amazon prime but I hate it for music.  I buy albums from iTunes that I can't find anywhere else, but i also have spotify premium and Tidal premium (i'm a Reddit anomaly - i like paying for shit).  Tidal is by far my favorite product of the 3, but it gets so much circle jerk hate its pointless.  If Apple creates something compelling that doesn't fuck over artists, I'm ok with that.  And i'll pay for it.Not to take away from the article because this information should definitely be shared but goddammit Dre looks so out of place in that first picture."
"I know he's moved on from the street life but knowing what he's done (from his words and those of his friends/enemies) I think under that half smile of his he's thinking fuck! I have become who I've hated"
"Then again he might just hate taking pictures.Apple is going to lose more money than it gains (from the bribing). If I'm big a label and I just invested 100k in an artist...There's no fucking way I would cut exposure for a shitty service as it is..I wany to downvote this so bad... But that's not how reddit works... Right???I subscribe to Spotify premium and I love it. It has such a nice value proposition and is actually easy to use on my Android. Listen to themed play lists and add it to your personal offline Playlist if you like it. I come from the age of LPs and casette tapes. I basically lost interest in music over the ages of cds and then I tunes. Now I'm finding songs I like again.. I hope Spotify remains...Ok I want namens."
"Who is pushing is. Because apple is not a person.and folks are surprised and dont believe jay-z when he says that apple is using ways to sabotage tidal I use apple products, and this is bull Sh..... I enjoy spotify. Beats was terrible and I don't care if apple backs them its garbage. you're right we'll all find cheaper alternatives regardless Beats will fail. It's almost like paying 4 billions for Dre's awesome music industry connections(tm) was not worth itYou could support spotify and pay for the service, it's only like $10 a month (go online and sign up, not the app), and $5 if you're a college student! You can listen to (commercial free!) and skip as many songs as you want...you have pretty much everything (besides Taylor swift :( ) for that amount! This is what happens when you get people emptying their pockets for whatever igadget they make. The egos at apple grew to this height because of the zombie-like behavior of the public with anything apple.Spotify will reign.Soundcloud?"
"What is the difference between paid streaming services and soundcloud?oh well FUCK YOU apple.Spotify should be pushing Spotify to kill free Spotify while they're losing 100 million dollars a year.100% for sure don't have my dollar now. I knew I still wanted to hate Apple. "
"It's nice that they are giving me a fresh reason.Well that would be the last time i bought any music from itunes then, as if i really ever do anyway. This is great idea! Like removing CD drives form their laptops! Yay!Spotify has been so sucky lately, if apple's service is any good, I will probably jump ship, and I've been using it pretty much since it came to my country.No, fuck offApple hasn't made a dollar off me in 4 years, will this kind of shit never will again. They got a slap on the wrist for the whole book thing, why wouldn't they do this here too? If the government wants companies to stop these practices they should you know, actually punish them for it.I would go out of my way to torrent the music of those artists, even if I don't listen to them, purely out of spite.If they manage to pull this off I will honestly boycott all Apple products for the rest of my life. Spotify is too damn useful motherfuckers.This sounds like one of those RT podcast explain to a caveman sentencesITT: Criminals"
"Wow ya'll a bunch of hypocrites.Email them guys. If nobody tells them now then they can put their hands up in future and say that nobody warned them just how fucking unpopular this was going to make them. Apparently Tim Cook is pretty good at replying to emails from what I hearOh apple, you scamps.shady shady"
"Because they weren't satisfied with one collusion settlement...ironically, if they shut down the free tier, they're just going to push more paid listeners into the hands of spotify. i have one paid account, and two free ones... i would go to three paid accounts if i had to.What good will that do? I'll still stick with Spotify and finally pay up.  Customer service goes a long way Apple.  If anyone wants a backup to Spotify, hype machine is pretty dopeAs someone that just started using Spotify in canada,  it has more or less stopped me from pirating music. If i can't get it through Spotify I'll find it through other means and support the artist in other waysSound like there needs to be an artist boycott list.Just makes me want to support Spotify more. Spotify is in an odd spot for me. Basically the free version is enough for me,  but because I enjoy the free service so much and use it daily,  I sub just to support. On a side note I have to admit I am impressed with Dr. Dre. I listened to his music and enjoyed it but he really made many great entrepreneurial decisions for himself to become a polarizing very wealthy individual after his music career.  "
"[(Dr Dre: hip-hop's first billionaire)](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f10e147c-e694-11e3-b8c7-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3ZE5VAmTq)i dont understand why apple would care so much about this...its not like there is alot of money in this. i pay $36/year for pandora and if that goes away i'd probably not renew it Can the FCC or CFPB regulate the music industry? for me spotify is the only reason I don't pirate. I pay for premium, but I'll never pay for an apple product for as long as I liveiBeat? Oh yeah, kill a free service used by the kids of EVERY US LAWMAKER. That's going to go down well. The article mentions apple wants to kill all free streaming services, so that also includes things like Pandora."
"The moment Pandora and Spotify inform their users of the switch-off, every congressman is going to get an earful about it, likely from personal family members. Pandora is already failing financially so this would just finish them off, the DOJ *should not* let them do this.  Unfortunately *should not* doesn't mean that they *will not*.Well, that's shitty of them, and I love Apple. They should compete on their own merits."
"That being said, I don't get streaming... I'd rather own my music. I supplement my movie and TV purchases with Netflix but a lot of people seem to use Spotify and other streaming services instead of having their own music library.I use both. I have ~80GB of legitimately ripped music on my phone, and Spotify Premium. A lot of my Spotify library is stuff I have on record but not CD, but I also use it to instantly listen to stuff that may randomly pique my interest, to try before I buy, or to explore artists or genres. Most stuff that I like I'll end up buying physical copies of, something that I've done a *lot* more of since subscribing.Same. I used to pirate all of my music, but once I settled on what kind of music I like, I stopped and started to slowly buy albums. Nothing beats perfect-quality FLAC rips.You can never *own* music unless you produce and release it yourself. "
"If you buy a mp3 or a CD you are still only licensing it. It's not your property. I'm pretty sure everyone reading my comment knows what I mean regardless of the semantics. Apple and Tidal are both spreading FUD as spotify doesn't have a *free* service. They have an advertising funded and a subscription funded service. The advertisers are paying for the music. It's free to users. But it's not. Your time listening to advertising has value. Someone paid spotify for your time. I think the pitchfork reaction against Apple is a little uninformed. If you read the article The Verge links to it says major labels want to kill Freemium serves, and Apple agrees. Apple isn't the one leading the charge, but they're not against it."
"Honestly, I'm all for this. I've been paying for Spotify since it was available in the U.S. and it's worth it. Not only that, I at least feel like I'm paying the artists for the music I listen to (I know they make hardly any profit from Spotify) and I'd be willing to pay more if it went to the artists. I have no plans to shift to Beats if this happens, I just think this will force a step in the right direction for music services."
"If Apple is doing this get a competitive edge (haha I'm sure they are), it's shitty, but I can't pretend like I'm not happy that (I hope) this means the artists will receive fairer compensation. We've had access to one of the biggest music libraries for free for years; I think it's more than fair to finally shift to a completely paid platform. "
"I'm tired of this I deserve free stuff because at least I'm not pirating mentality. ITT "
"Rawr!!! **Apple** *rabble rabble rabble* They forgot about 'Dre!These days everybody want to talk, but nothing comes out when they move their lips Google play music, $10 bucks a month and no regrets. Apple can go F itself.You would think they learned from their ebooks fiasco not to pull shit like this. Guess they want to get the $3 billion they flushed down the toilet for Beats somehow."
"Also if Spotify kills free streaming, I'll just go back to torrenting all my music.> I'll just go back to torrenting all my music"
"So if you can't have it for free, you'll steal it. (I'm not arguing against a free music tier, or that Apple should be able to strong arm Spotify out doing a free tier. Instead lets say Spotify just ended it on their own.) Your statement is just a rather shitty way to think. The sentiment you oppose is rampant on reddit. There's no point arguing against it. Everyone thinks that if a company doesn't give them what they want in the exact format they demand, they should have it for free. Hence the paid mods fiasco (OMG why the fuck should I have to pay for work someone else did?!) and now this shit (OMG what if I can't get my music for free anymore, I'll go from giving nothing to artists to giving nothing to artists by just stealing it!). "
"I used to think Reddit was composed mainly of college students, but it's not; it's unemployed or near-broke 20-35 year olds who bitch and complain about the man (whoever it may be that day) oppressing their choices and not giving them something for free. Be it health insurance, music, video games, etc.I don't think the problem (at least with the paid mods) was OMG why the fuck should I have to pay for work someone else did?! and was more We've been enjoying this for free for years without any issue, why is payment suddenly mandatory. Also to be clear before I continue, my point of view is that people should be allowed to charge what ever they want for content they create. The problem comes when they charge more than what the masses deem it worth ($100 for a $10 product), or if they suddenly bump up the price without reason or notice (similar product being x10 more  expensive), then they shouldn't be surprised if people bitch and moan."
"I can't speak for torrenting, but pretty much everyone has pirated something at some point in their lives. Online services pulled them out of it (Steam, Netflix, Spotify, etc...) but if it gets taken away they won't move up to a better service but they will slide back down to something they know, which is piracy for most. I'm not saying piracy isn't wrong, but I also think that piracy in most cases is a service issue and not about people being unwilling to pay. People will gladly pay for a good service, I think Steam and Netflix are good examples. In marketing class I constantly get told good marketing is designing a product that meets peoples' needs, and then you price it accordingly."
"What all of these music labels (and really any content licenseholders) seem not to understand is, what consumers ***need*** is a one-stop shop for their music, or their movies, or TV. I guarantee if there were a single streaming service that had *all music available*, people would not mind paying to properly compensate all those involved. So, in other words, you want to eliminate all competition. That sounds healthy. But they know that. Hence why Apple would happily kill Spotify if it could and crown itself the one-stop shop for all music.Because of this shit, I've just half a mind to give up on music. I haven't paid for an album (not downloaded them either btw) in nearly 10 years. Sorry for the artists, but greedy companies like Apple have ruined it for everyone. I fucking hate Apple with an irrational level of repulsion. Eurgh....Sorry just ventingThat just made me realize that I haven't owned a new song for almost a decade now. The only times I hear new songs now is from the radio or in movies. Does apple just not have enough money?"
"BTW - they are scolding taking money from affluent musicians while always promoting their right to outsource dirt cheap child labor. It's truly sad to see a company that already has so much of the market share pull stuff like this. Spotify was original and groundbreaking enough to gain the userbase that it has and now a giant company wants to take that away from them. There's almost no incentive for startups to create new services anymore. Spotify rose on the backs of artists.  You may as well torrent songs; it's the same as far an artist is concerned.  Apple has always negotiated with the interest of artists at the center.I don't really agree with that. Either way the majority of the money that artists generate is from touring. The labels are the ones that make the money from album sales. This doesn't hurt the artists. They're making plenty as it is. This is all about quality of the product for the consumer. I basically agree with everything you just said, but would like to emphasize that the negotiations are currently surrounding what share of digital sales should go to the artist, what share to the executives, and what share to the provider."
"It seems to me that Apple is trying to persuade music labels to drop rights to 'freemium' services, because they just don't make enough money for the artist."
"It is always a constant battle between content producers and content managers.  In America, the current swing is HUGE SUMS to the CEO!  But the average worker gets piss squat.  And union busting is in fashion again!"
"In this case, it's a small battle Apple is waging to rebrand a new sort of streaming service, but do it a little different, and with an emphasis on the artist.  I think that's the right thing to do, personally.The way you described it sounds great, however let's get a little bit serious here. Apple is a huge company. Them sounding like they want to do this for artists is all marketing. They don't actually care. This is all about their service gaining all the market share that Spotify would lose if they dropped their free services. In no way is this Apple being the good guy, but rather the opposite. It's all about money for THEM. Not th3 artists. Even if that is your view about Apple's attitude towards this...artists will still stand to make more money from this.  So does it matter?"
"And if Apple only cared about their marketshare, why negotiate higher payouts for artists at all?It matters to me as the consumer, because this ends up being (most likely) more money for me, and a hassle switching services, if necessary. "
"And they're doing this to bring people to it, because it makes them look like the good guy, and Spotify the bad. When I say does it matter, what I mean in the context of that statement is does it matter what their reasoning is, if you get the same result.  In other words, if Apple only did it ONLY to make money, or if Apple did it to produce the best streaming service possible for artists, doesn't matter because the result is the same."
"As for does it matter if Apple gets its way?  Of course it does, things will be very different for artists and consumers alike.  Yes, you will have to pay for a service you're using.  Not much, likely $10 a month.  They tried to negotiate $7.99 but that was too low for record labels.  I pay $10/month to NPR and $2/month for iTunes Match, which is essentially ad free iTunes Radio and a cloud service.  I won't mind upping that $2/mo to $10/mo if it means artists get more of the take.  (As an artist myself.)"
"You say they're doing it because it makes them look like the good guy, but I can't think of worse press than this article, I seem to be the only one in this entire thread coming at it from this angle!We're coming from similar angles I think. I also pay for a service. I have Spotify premium, and have for roughly 2 years. I have no issue with giving more to artists, but if the amount that Apple charges for their service is more than I pay currently, I'm just going to go back to torrenting and using my iPod. I'd much rather support the artists I want to support by going to shows and buying their merch as they get a lot larger cut from those things. I wouldn't pay Apple for a service that's already available from a different company. There's no need for them to enter the market at all. EDIT: Meant to say I think we are, too.  And I think largely people would agree if the title of the article wasn't to clickbaity."
"According to this article, your service wouldn't change at all."
"And since the negotiations aren't complete, we don't know exactly what's going to happen.  But in any case, you shouldn't worry about losing your service."
"What Apple is trying to do, is negotiate a higher payout for everyone, by encouraging all streaming services to charge some minimum fee."
"Right now, companies are subsidizing this cost on the backs of artists using ad revenue and selling user data.Fuckin nazisApple doing something shitty?! No way! /sFuck you Apple.  Shit like this is why I refuse to buy your shit.  You compete by force, not offering superior services/products. It's almost as if Apple WANTS the Apple-hating to thrive. I love my iPod and my daughter loves her iPhone, but damn, they make me want to not buy another one sometimes.How about we kill Apple again?When will the herd learn that they are only encouraging Apple by using their overpriced products? When will the herd draw themselves ethical lines and can hold themselves to it?I guess the heard as you condescendingly call them, don't feel they are overpriced. When will you learn that they are good services, you might as well say :)They want to move all the paying costumers to their service and have other customers to get the music for free instead of listening to ads on Apple's competitor networks."
"The result ? Apple gets rich, while the competitors suffer due to increased piracy."
"I'm so glad I left Apple a couple years back. This is 100% anti competitive behaviour Back to pirating I suppose.  YarrrWelp back to pirating. Fuck apple in their stupid asses. I would rather never listen to music than give them one dime.If the title is accurate and not editorialized, it is just another example on why I'll keep buying Microsoft and Google products.Beats headphones are TERRIBLE. ... I don't want any part of their Apple-purchased-Beats shenanigans.Did you hear that? They are ok, actually. A bit pricy. Apple, this shit costs you business.  Get it through your corporate skull! People want less expensive access to music.  Fucking make it happen and you'll keep business.  Fight it and pirates will steal your profit.  It isn't that damn difficult to figure out.I don't see Apple so much as a tech corporation but a giant fire department grade industrial water cannon that sprays shit on everything people have built to make other people happy.Fucking hate Apple. Asshole of a company. The sad part is people keep punishing Microsoft but continue to support these douchebags.Well, some people like their products, dislike Microsoft's and don't care about the companies too much. And vice versa. What makes me sick is that no matter what horrible crap apple pulls, people will still line up in droves to buy any and every new product.  Beats are absolutely terrible for their price. I can buy a $150 pair of Audio Technicas that are MUCH better than even Beats Studios; the only reason they sell is because of their excessive celebrity promotions. Doesn't surprise me though, Apple has always been a moneygrabber.There is also the fashion element. That'd also the primary reason expensive clothes sell. Though they don't seem to speak about the horrible Headphones (my 30-50$ Superluxes are better than Beats..) but about a streaming service, you are right.You compete by being better, not through dirty tactics. When will these companies learn.When it stops working, hah.Doesn't this qualify as some sort of anti trust deal at this point?Hey apple, you already make a 40% margin on products, is that not good enough for you? How about you step away from a realm that you have no business being in.I've just been using YouTube to stream all my music through https://streamus.com, I love it.This all seems like a picture-perfect example of anticompetitive behavior.I like my iPhone. But seriously, fuck Apple.They're going to have to push pretty hard. A record label makes a very significant profit off of spotify streams. Apple's mom.If spotify dies because of this, I'll just jump right back into torrenting. When you have no idea how to make your product better than the competition's, the best way to garner new business and cling to your existing customer base is to eliminate the competition. It's been years since they've been able to make a product that's better than the competition's products. Yes, this is a new area Apple hasn't really been in before, but it looks like they're fairly confident this new product won't be able to stand on its own.This is anti-consumer! I like the owner of Spotify. In the early days when Spotify was getting started, he received purchase offers from *all* the big boys. Apple, Amazon, Google etc. But he said no. He was already a minor millionaire from another company he started so Spotify was his passion project. "
"Aside from monopoly always being bad for the customer (cough AT&T Comcast), I like the idea of supporting a passion project. Opposed to a company filled with old owners who are all solely interested in maximizing profits. That's just upsetting.My iPhone won't load the comments for some reason. hey, remember the antitrust lawsuits against microsoft for doing something similar with IE?"
"yeah no, you cant do this.How is that even remotely similar?The free Spotify is subsidized by advertisements. I think they are more threatened by a competitor. Otherwise, I'm sure they would be after Pandora as well. [YAR HAR FIDDLE DEE DEE.](http://www.viciouspotato.net/)I think they should be pushing to reincarnate Steve Jobs, because Apple has seriously lost their wayDouchebag Apple I just assume Beats' services just being of lower quality and higher costs, like Beats. Apple is the gift that keeps on giving...and by gift I mean reasons why to NEVER buy anything from Apple. I sure hope Google never turns evil like Apple has in my lifetimeSneaker-net.  Convenience is what makes most of these models work. If you remove the convenience and the price becomes an inconvenience, you face something you can never kill, which is the sneaker-net."
"In the old days we'd net message everyone on the college network and have a zip drive (or Jaz if you were that rich fuck) swap party."
"So that's what happened to Grooveshark.I'm honestly surprised more people don't just pirate their music.isnt Apple cooooool now......hahahahhai already dislike apple, but i had an appreciation for their marketing/success. Now i literally fucking hate this company. YOU GUYS REALLY NEED THE MONEY HUH? REALLY STRUGGLING HUH? Sorry but this is a huge problem with not only apple, but company greediness in general.Um, didn't they hire like, one of the most prolific artists on Earth? Plus Jimmy Iovine, whom, if you don't know, is a pretty damn big deal in the music business. And also one of those guys who hires guys to break your legs. Or so I've heard."
"And, um, aren't all artists pretty much **against** the free services because they get less billions? I mean, you gotta have your champagne filled swimming pool, amirite?It's nice to see that Steve Jobs' spirit lives on.This is fucking stupid. . It would just encourage downloading music illegally all over again. I'd rather pay for unlimited music rather than per song. Dude. FUCK. Apple.Apple: The new 90's Microsoft Wait, they're also killing music on Youtube? I'm surprised that Google isn't pushing back on that one The studios arent fond of googleWhen you're a company the size of Apple, you don't need to take risks anymore. You can acquire patents, influence legislation and manipulate the competition to create an environment in which you are likely to succeed. This is their business model moving forward.I'd rather not have to deal with collections of mp3s over various devices again..."
"But I would go back to torrenting so fucking fast.One of the many reasons why people should boycott Apple. I hate everything about the beats brand, from teh stupid headphones to Apple's stupid decision to brand a fucking Pandora clone off of it. Love apple gadgets, but I dont care for the Beats brand and I will never use it.Alright apple fans question time:  how the fuck do you justify ever giving this company which has violently put down riots and is literally trying to put art being a paywall so they can extract even more money from people when apple doesn't **need** more profits. "
"1. Spotify doesn't earn any money for artists. They get <$0.0005 per song play."
"2. Spotify and other streaming services also put art behind a paywall. Instead of paying cash for free spotify, you listen to ads as your method of payment instead. "
"3. How has Apple violently put down riots? What? If this is about some third-world assembly line thing, then you realize that literally every other tech company builds products the same way, right?"
"I pay for Spotify and use it to discover music that I then buy so I don't have to stream it. If you want to pretend to be making a moral argument, then consider again that song plays by non-paying Spotify users make the artist practically nothing (definitely less than plays by paid users, which is still nearly nothing). You could easily argue that putting music behind this paywall (i.e. making people pay for their music and not just leech it for free) will do much more for the artists than the people circlejerking about how they might not have free music for much longer.Arguably free services devalue a product. "
"However Spotify, Pandora, etc have paid and free tiers, the free is usually accompanied by advertisements... yet Spotify and Pandora don't pay artists shit. "
"Also this is a rumor and not a fact. Guys think about it a little bit."
"Music labels and artists already hate the Spotify free service.  They get almost no money from it.  [As Radiohead member Thom Yorke described Spotify](http://www.businessinsider.com/thom-yorke-explains-why-he-hates-spotify-2013-10): "
">[he described] the company as the last desperate fart of a dying corpse..."
"Apple has always been on the side of artists when it comes to products and services, and has always believed that art should be paid for.  There is no free lunch, and if you want music to exist, you HAVE to support it.  "
"I think Apple is trying to move the entire industry in that direction, and I think music labels and artists agree with this idea, which is the only reason Apple has any leverage at all."
"I wouldn't say they're targeting Spotify, (as the article does say services *like* Spotify force streaming services like Spotify to abandon their free tiers), I would say they're targeting any free service that doesn't pay the artists some minimum amount."
"TLDR; Apple is trying to get the major labels to agree to minimum price-per-play across the board, because services like Spotify are bad for emerging artists who can't afford the fractions of a cent per play ($0.006 to $0.0084 per stream).We need a popcorntime equivalent for music. Fuck Apple in general. This won't do anything productive for them it will just increase piracy. It's not just Apple that wants to see an end to Spotify, artists and labels are also starting to complain about the paltry sums they receive from streaming sources.They won't get a penny more from Apple, if anything they'll get less since Apple wants to charge less per month.  "
"They will get a big payment from Apple itself that they won't have to share with the artists however, because it won't be for artist-specific streams.   If Apple gives a label a million bucks, that's a million for the label, not the artists.  Would the label kick back that money to the artists?  Nope!  "
"Everyone but the label gets screwed in an exclusivity deal.  Hi, Apple Fanboy here. Fuck Apple."
"- Sincerely a once proud Apple fan.Apple is a great example of how Capitalism went wrong.If they manage to do this, I'll just jump to the flailing TIDAL lol. You ain't getting a costumer out of me Apple!Well there is a precedence for this sort of shit though. Not sure why but April 30th; Grooveshark went black.If I remember right Grooveshark went dark due to the fact they weren't paying ANY royalties at all.  They got caught and it was either close down or be bankrupt for the rest of their lives due to lawsuits.This makes me wonder if Apple is to blame for grooveshark getting shut downQuote Article - Getting the music labels to kill the freemium tiers from Spotify and others could put Apple in prime position to grab a large swath of new users when it launches its own streaming service, which is widely expected to feature a considerable amount of exclusive content."
"No it won't. The reason is. Apple products cost to damn much. There is a reason folks listen to the Free Spotify, I do not mind the ads as long as the volume leveling is the same as the tunes. Do they really think folks will pony up for a Apple service when Spotify will be cheaper even if they do away with Free Subs? Not only that, but I would not pay Apple on principle. I would go to Spotify or any other supplier because of underhanded business practices. Pandora or even Internet Radio. "
"Apple smoked its lunch on that one."
"I admit,Apple makes some damn sexy hardware, or rather puts current hardware in sexy damn packaging. Then ups the price by 200%. They can keep it, thanks.It's like Apple finds the early evil Microsoft empire to be something to emulate.  I actually think Apple of is far worse in that respect with even worse vendor lock in and corporate control and dipping fingers in every pie.  The hardware is fantastic but software you are forced to use is often shitty and lacking key features other apps provide but Apple says you can't install those apps.  It's kind of ridiculous.  "
"Apple should just buy Spotify really. Apple launching a new service and hindering Spotify with these kind of actions is just going to hurt both of them. Your downvoter disagrees and thinks Apple should use illegal coercion and anti-trust policies to take them over for free.Or perhaps they don't want Apple to get their greasy mits on a good quality service and ruin it.Just fucking buy spotify for ffs. You have billions of dollar in cash. Just wondering how much of this is made up of wild guesses. No official statement from any party involved."
"> Sources also indicated that Apple offered to pay YouTube's music licensing fee to Universal Music Group if the label stopped allowing its songs on YouTube."
"Come on now, they are not even trying anymore.Another reason  to  dislike apple What is the solution.These people need to learn that fighting the new age of music consumption is the worst idea, they need to embrace it and be ahead of the curve. If the big labels had embraced change at the birth of streaming and file sharing they wouldn't have had to spend so much time and effort fighting it, which didn't do anything. Piracy is at an all time high and album sales are at an all time low. It's too late to go back to album sales as the primary revenue. They need to introduce a low cost streaming service like Spotify that handles the split point percentages better than Spotify. Or some other similar platform. I love Spotify, but it honestly doesn't pay out fairly. Labels are going to waste their time fighting tooth and nail against streaming, file sharing, and pirating all the way up until they realize they are in the grave. They need to wisen up and not fight Spotify, but beat Spotify by being better.Spotify compensation is fair. To the label. Artists need to stop ragging on spotify and start ragging on their label to share some of the royalties. "
"Remember artists don't own music. Labels own the music. And where would that money come from? Spotify loses money on the free users. Don't fool yourself, those ads are not remotely close to pay a fair royalty. that's why they are trying to kill spotify free. Arrrr maty! Plot twist: Jay Z convinced Apple to do this so he can make his price reduction announcement: LOW TIDE! Get Tidal! Tidal takeova! XDI see a big circle jerk around Spotify, yet the truth is this:"
"http://thejazzline.com/news/2014/11/spotify-revenue-growth-loss-increase/"
"Spotify has been sustaining losses since its inception and the larger the user base the larger the losses. It's an unsustainable business model. The way content is consumed these days it's largely a loss leader, so they'll end up bought by someone big.while technically correct, the growth part is a stoppable thing.  Spotify could stop growing right now, stop expanding development, offices, and outreach and just start turning a profit within a year based on existing revenue and contracts."
"Since that's not how a pre-IPO company tends to make the most of their IPO or revenue in the future, they'll keep hiring people, keep building out new offices, keep growing.    At some point maybe they'll stop, but it's probably a sustainable business once they lay off the growth development and focus on maintenance and a long-term upgrade cycle on the front end and back end.  "
"Also, that ain't exactly a business focused website, so I don't know that I'd trust them to properly evaluate the profitability of a startup. Apparently [Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-05-21/why-spotify-and-the-streaming-music-industry-cant-make-money) shared some of my views as of last year. "
"It's not just Spotify either: the entire industry of music streaming is similarly unprofitable, and Spotify's competitors like [Deezer, Rhapsody](http://jonmaples.com/2015/03/03/growing-concerns-does-music-subscriber-growth-cripple-profitability/) and [SoundCloud](http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/11/soundcloud-posted-a-29m-loss-in-2013-on-revenues-of-14m/) are getting losses in proportion to their userbase. Either everyone is doing the exact same thing as Spotify or the money is simply not there.Anyone else think with was/jobs this company is a pile of shit? They haven't come out with anything innovative, and things like this pop up time and time again now. The company is heading downhill.I have a feeling they helped kill Grooveshark :(I recently began downloading my entire iTunes Match library to my MacBook, converting everything to MP3 with the intent of putting it on Amazon.  "
"Your Prime account already gets you a streamable AND downloadable for offline playback library of 1,000,000 songs - the same $24.99 / yr that iTunes charges lets you put up to 250,000 songs in the Amazon Prime Music cloud.  Many current artists across all genres have their latest albums in Prime Music for completely free listening and downloading. "
"The Radio Stations of hundreds of playlists that amazon curates had been about as good, in my experience, as iTunes Radio - and again, unlike iTunes, you can download everything to your device for offline playback layer.  "
"The iTunes app is ugly, and it angers me that there is no dark/ night mode. The Amazon Music app is much better looking.  Built in lyrics is nice too. "
"Let me get this straight - apple is beginning to piss people off with pricing and content restriction issues , while Microsoft, of all companies, is giving windows 10 away for free, is publishing free iOS apps that are category killers, is murdering Dropbox by selling the same 1tb subscription level for $30 less per year WHILE including a full office365 subscription at that price - queue the what year is it!? Meme jpg. "
"All this will do is speed up the development of a Popcorn Time- style client but for streaming torrented music. Torrents for beats and tidal exclusives and paid Spotify for offline playlists. Fuck Apple and fuck tidal. I bet they killed grooveshark as well. Fuck 'emGrooveshark just didn't pay for licenses. Irrelevant As a music making guy I don't want to have the average apple user for fan,  apple kills every trace of creativity under the cover of design etc.  Fuck apple,  support GNUMusic labels? Apple? Who are these things you speak of?"
"Oh that is right, I only support independent music artist and I enjoy building my computers without proprietary software."
"Fuck'em both."
"Apple says iPhone 'Error 53' is to protect customers' securityTL;DR - Apple did not clearly state the impact of the iOS9 security improvements to those that had 3rd party repairs."
"I searched error 53 on Apple's site"

"Make sure that your security software and settings are allowing communication between your device and update servers."
"If you still see the error message when you update or restore, contact Apple support."
"If you still see the error message, check for outdated or modified software.*"
"Not particularly insightful in light of current events."
"The point in favor of the customer is there is no easy to find consequence (aside from nullifying the warranty and support from Apple) from having a third party repair the device. I ignored recent posts and articles on the issue just to determine if a user could reasonably determine prior to recent events the consequence of repairing an idevice through a third party. I searched through the iphone user guide, info pdf's, googled error 53, and tried sourcing other channels within Apple's web site, for anything outlining the devices would be disabled if compromised. Didn't find anything readily relevant. "
"To those arguing the value of secured data - I do not doubt your argument. Technically, you're right, and it would be a reasonable course of action to protect your data. It should also be clearly disclosed."
"There is no explicit physical consequence listed in the iPhone manual or related documents for having the device repaired by a third party. A customer would not get the impression the device would be disabled after reading the supplied documents. Consequences to Apple's Warranty and willingness to repair third party repaired devices at the end of warranty are described, not device bricking. The warranty is a year long, contracts can last longer, and a non warranty repair from Apple are pricey. That, and the consequence of updating a third party repaired idevice from iOS 8 to 9 is not obvious either. "
"[Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2016/02/05/iphone-6-killing-error-53-highlights-big-ios-9-problem/#66b61924284a) covered the issue as well. Information posted by Apple regarding the changes to Touch id,"
"[Improved security with two-factor authentication support and a default 6 digit passcode support for Touch ID devices](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1842?locale=en_US), that's it."
"Following the Apple support link relating to the page above (for Touch ID), security information regarding changes to Touch ID. If they clearly stated The device will be completely and permanently disabled if repaired by an unauthorized third party, and will no longer be supported in any way by Apple one can argue against recent complaints. It doesn't. I think at the very least Apple is going to have to backtrack a little bit here and allow people to get their modified phones fixed by  an Apple Store or a premium service provider. I just feel that at some point, enough people will have lost data (pictures) and will sue at a class action level. You don't think Apple has a class action waiver in their purchase agreement?Apple pushes for back up (pretty much prompts you to use iCloud backup, back up to computer is more a choice the user needs to make) so data loss tends to be your own fault.Seriously. Or at the very least have a way to get data back. I have a friend that got an iphone a few weeks ago and like a clumsy moron dropped it. He got it repaired and got this error. Luckily it was like a month after he bought it so he tried to return it for a refund but when he couldn't he was able to get a chargeback. That kicked his brain into the on position so now he's waiting for his new android to ship to him, but this could still be financially a bitch for a lot of people.I don't buy/own any Apple products (just because of preference), but don't they have/enable cloud sync (time machine?) or similar to prevent lost data/pictures?I know that legally they'd have a case, but as someone who works with a lot of important data regularly, I have little sympathy for anyone who doesn't maintain a backup.>I think at the very least Apple is going to have to backtrack a little bit here and allow people to get their modified phones fixed by an Apple Store or a premium service provider. "
"Totally agree, and my guess is that they will in short order. In general their customer service is top notch. They owned up to repairing a hand me down 2007 MBP that was long since out of warranty. It took me a few tries at the Genius Bar to find the tech that had the chops to recognize the issue was caused by a known design flaw. Apple replaced the motherboard free of charge."
">I just feel that at some point, enough people will have lost data (pictures) and will sue at a class action level. "
"Losing data always sucks, but people with iOS devices really don't have much of an excuse for not having everything backed up. Synch with iTunes or iCloud  is seamless and built in.Apple stores will fix the issue even now... They will just charge you.They are Apple. Lol no back tracking just a excuse like you are holding it wrong.I don't think they can backtrack on this. "
"Everyone seems to be forgetting that the fingerprint scanner is used to authorize purchases via ApplePay.  It would be like having 3rd parties repair credit card terminals - will never happen.Apple doesn't even fix the button, they replace the phone. Because fixing the button voids the ability to have a secure fingerprint reader. It nullifies the ability to have apple pay as a secure option and frankly there is nothing wrong there in my opinion."
"The problem isn't the security feature, it's that it was undiscussed and not optional. If this was a known security feature, at the least, was not implemented more or less silently with a very normal upgrade, it wouldn't be a problem. It's a cool feature, if you know about it, and choose it.Maybe not repair, but certainly be forthcoming with a swap or warranty replacement. After all, if the phone is designed to brick as a security measure, it should be considered normal use. As for data loss...anyone who wishes to keep the information on their phone but doesn't keep a backup deserves what they get. I guarantee that plaintiff lawyers all over the country are already laying groundwork to sue over itI'm sure they can afford to give a few thousand people $10 for the suit.why not now.  This is why Apple emphasizes that you back your phone up. When I took my phone to get fixed at a third party retailer, they made no such emphasis. This may only be my experience. I believe the user should have some responsibility in protecting their data. With that said, it is kind of shitty that their devices are rendered useless after an update. Think of the amount of people who have iPhones, you have to realize that at least half of them have zero technical aptitude and may have never backed up their phones, or even created an iCloud account. While it's the users fault they don't have a backup, and the users fault they voided their warranty, they should not reasonably expect to lose access to the stuff on their phone."
"And let's be clear, the only thing most people care about on their phones are their pictures. This isn't a life or death issue here, it is at most an inconvenience. However it's still a dick move by Apple. And the fact that apple stole the use of a functioning phone from them.If anything they will just release a statement in future updates warning against 3rd party hardware use in the UK this is straight up against anti-competition laws. You can't prohibited someone from using a different service in this way.I'm sure Apple would argue that they aren't, the third party service did the repair incorrectly.   "
"The *real* problem here is that Apple hasn't released documentation on how to re-code an existing iPhone to a new touch ID sensor, but currently the way the law is written it is unclear that they *have* to.    "
"From what I've read, the third parties are using real touch ID sensors, and installing them correctly, they just weren't aware until now that the touch ID module had a unique code that needed to be updated.    "
"I'm sure someone will spend some time figuring out how to clone a touch ID sensor and flash the new module, however the new procedure may increase repair costs via third parties (as now the process is more involved).   "
"Ultimately if we really wanted to see change, we should ask for a law that *requires* Apple to release the maintenance manual for their devices (the same one legit technicians utilise). That would resolve this and future incidents which are similar.   "
"I find the whole thing mildly amusing that this may be the only way a touch ID has actually stopped someone gaining access to a phone. Even if was the owner this time Someone said yesterday that releasing the code to third parties would be a security risk - which makes sense. I think what Apple is going to have to do is figure out a way to replace or repair these devices so the security is still protected but people aren't pissed off. Security through obscurity isn't security at all in the first place. The only security risk that can come from revealing code is revealing actual security flaws in that code that already exist regardless of whether or not that code is released.They could already do this by only disabling Touch ID instead of the entire phone.Why can't users still use the phone if they know the passcode?It looks like Apple programmed the phone to say Oh, you installed a part made by someone else? Then I will stop working entirelyI'm pretty sure one of those long contracts you agree to says you void the warranty if someone non Apple-certified opens up the phone.  It may be tough for a suit to work in that case.Terms of Servicea don't trump established lawa in the Eu,  not sure what it's like in the US but the Eu does have consumer protections legislationTheres a difference in Apple not being responsible for the device after a 3rd party repair and, actively killing it and locking out the data.It wouldn't be a warranty lawsuit.  A company creating products that deliberately self-destruct when you use a third-party service or components is extremely anti-competitive."
"If Honda released an OTA update to their cars that cause the engine to self-destruct when a oil change that took place at a non-Honda dealer is detected, do you really think Honda would get away with that? Even with cars out of warranty?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnuson%E2%80%93Moss_Warranty_Act  People are still free to use the phone...  They can install other software if they want.  They broke the warranty...  So they voided their software license. They do if they lobby enough. Well, it is actually illegal in USA for automotive manufacturers to void a warranty for using aftermarket parts (within reason, if you put on a supercharger don't expect to win in court when your engine blows up), so maybe Congress should expand that to computer hardware as well.You got an iPhone, It's from Apple, don't expect it to be open. Apple makes closed systems, you know that.Imagine if Microsoft were the company in this story. We would already be handing out torches and pitchforks.I think Apple might actually prevail in that case.  John Deere has been locking down their tractors for years now preventing farmers from making repairs without taking it to the dealership.  Apple likely saw how successful (and how John Deere was allowed to keep doing it) and decided to do the same thing themselves."
"http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/08/17/432601480/diy-tractor-repair-runs-afoul-of-copyright-lawI don't think it's the same as your example at all. "
"Let's say I have a computer with data I need to protect so I put whole disk encryption on it. Everytime I log in I have to enter a password to decrypt my data (theres more to it, but you get the point). One day I spill coffee on the machine and damage the EEPROM (where the key is likely stored) and not the disk. I take it to a drive repair shop and they tell me the drives fine but the data is encrypted and the public key is no longer accessible. "
"Did the  WDE not do it's job? Error 53 sounds like it's doing exactly what its supposed to do... protect your data. If someone were to steal my phone and replace my touch-id with a modified one, they could potentially access my data...Wait isn't that oil change thing exactly what BMW does with their new cars?No, their engines don't stop working, you just can't change it yourself.It's illegal for manufacturers to void a warranty for using aftermarket parts, within reason. For example, if your engine blows up BMW can't void your warranty because you have aftermarket wheels. Oil is a standardized commodity so as long as you use the specified motor oil then the automaker would be breaking the law if they voided the warranty, much less bricked your car.I think it's a matter of security.  Apple is saying that thieves could replace the TouchID with a fake one and gain access to the phone that way.  So Apple made it so they couldn't do it."
"So a more fair comparison would be if Honda made it so cars wouldn't start with non-Honda keys... which would allow anyone to make a key for any Honda.they can disable only the touch id part, not the whole damn phone.Which is precisely what they do in fact.Can you replace a screen without replacing the touchID sensor?  The screen itself has nothing to do with security.The issue comes when the home button itself needs replacing, not so much the screen. The new button will work fine minus Touch ID, but as soon as you update the device it kills the phone, which is the upsetting portionAh, so I guess it's expecting to see a TouchID sensor and doesn't, hence the error.  I could see a security justification to not make 3rd party touchID sensors work, but a button with no sensor isn't really a security risk.  You just loose some features.  Apple would have to program for this use case, but I guess they never expected or cared for a 6S to suddenly not have a touchID sensor.Yeah we reuse the home button every time in thousands of repairs I've never broken one.  I'm worried that people are going to be afraid to use us now based on a misunderstanding.And that is precisely what apple wants. That's not totally analogous here. The TouchID sensor is a key security component and vital to the security of the phone and it's data. If you replaced the Honda's ECU with a 3rd party computer, they wouldn't honor the warranty when the engine failed."
"But, even then, replacing parts in your car isn't the same. There's no part in a car that, when replaced maliciously, would grant an attacker access to your financial data."
"If remotely bricking a few minivans would help Honda  avoid the potential for being liable for millions in fraudulent transactions, they'd do it in a heartbeat.They have to prove that the new ECU was the source of the engine failing, actually.There's no way they'd get away with that though. Causing your entire product to stop working through a remote update, and saying it's unrepairable because you changed one part seems like a bit much. Imagine if you had to buy a whole new car.That's not a fair analogy though.  If you replaced the Honda's ECU with a 3rd party computer, it voids the warranty.  Sure.  Fine totally fair.  But ..."
"What's happening here is more like replacing the Honda ECU with a third party THAT WORKS PERFECTLY, and then 6 months later, a Honda technician suddenly shows up and deliberately trashes your car with a sledgehammer...Would Honda be killing the engine via some sort of software update? Because I don't think this is the same.  These phones aren't failing, they're functioning just fine, and then they're being bricked intentionally by Apple's software update.>they wouldn't honor the warranty"
"Nor would they be expected to.  However, if they keyed the engine to explode when you switched the ECU with a 3rd party's, they'd be liable regardless of warranty.Well the analog would actually be refusing to start the engine in that situation which is pretty reasonable.Also pretty bullshit.  It means you'd have to only get your car serviced at the dealership, for a substantial markup, and is anticompetitive.  If a car manufacturer made your car inoperable if you didn't get it solely serviced at all times by Honda with Honda specified parts, no one would buy that car because that's some bullshit nigh-monopolistic practice right there.It's really not as it's limited to critical elements."
"We'll be seeing much more of it as car automation continues."
">it's really not as it's limited to critical elements"
"So because it's limited to the things your device/car needs to be a device/car that makes it ok?  Nevermind that when my engine fails, right now, I can order a replacement engine and fit it myself for a quarter the cost of having Toyota do it.  But if I had to install a toyota engine through a toyota tech I'd be *forced* to spend 4 times as much for something I could easily do myself if not for a handful of lines of code."
"Further the it's common argument does not make it right.A car's engine is more like a phone's screen in that it's still a fundamentally dumb device right now. "
"A more fitting analogy would be replacing a bumper or other assembly with a smart sensor such as radar, lidar or camera sensors. In this case it's perfectly reasonable for the car to start if the device on the other end can not be securely verified as the sensor data cannot be trusted to be within operational range otherwise. "
"In the case of the iPhone there's the additional case of information security which prevents regular key based methods to work as doing so would allow attackers to copy the credentials of a compromised device and mirror it elsewhere.  no, the analog would be that you had already changed out the broken ecu for an identically speced unit, and the next time you took your vehicle to the dealership for *anything*, they (without warning) replace your car with a brick.Are the iPhones keyed to explode?"
"Is the data actually lost or is the vast majority backed up to iCloud or third party backends allowing you to recover it once you get a new phone?Data is intact. If you bring your phone with non original home button to an Apple Store they can replace the home button, and run the tool, idk if it's software only, but whatever they need to do, they can do to pair the new home to the device. Then the update will work, resulting in a software update and not a restore."
"However I know first hand that apples first move at almost every repair is a backup / restore of the device. Since backup after the error 53 presents is impossible, I'm not sure that that would be the move. Is that why the article says that the only option is to replace the phone?  Because that's what it said....Article is not 100% correct about everything. "
"You can take your phone to an Apple Store, and have them do do an actual out of warranty repair. The article is completely false about a lot of things. This doesn't permanently brick the phone at all, you should have regular backups on itunes on your home computer if you know anything about anything."
"Apple will install the new touch ID and you can go home and restore from backup. Done and Done.It's lost so far.  No means of recovery.This is false. Replace the third-party part with a genuine one and the phone is back to normal. So Apple is using ransomware? Pay up so we give you your data back? Hahaha, what the fuck.No. They are saying Fuck you, your data is gone and there is nothing we can do about it. You probably want to buy a new phone nowgenuine"
"As though a third party part is somehow wrong...literally the only thing that makes a third party part inappropriate is that Apple programmed the device *you own* not to let you use anything but their far more expensive version of the same part.TouchID is unique here, because it is a component that generates cryptographic hashes.  Crypto is tricky business, and has laws and regulations surrounding it's use.  It's entirely reasonable for them to require their own hardware for the TouchID button, because otherwise it would be theoretically possible to create and spoof a device that could decrypt your phone, which would be bad."
"Where Apple went wrong here, is they did it without warning.  They could have set a date ahead of time to tell people or they could have set the requirements only on the new iPhone being released in less than two months.Not true, even if genuine it won't work, the board has to be reprogrammed to the new ID.False. Your data is encrypted, when the key is gone, the data is still there but you cannot decrypt it so its gone. The mainboard and Touch ID are paired at the factory and nowhere else. Once the pair is broken, the key will not work. And? That's not what was asked. "
">  No means of recovery."
"was the claim. That is false. Replace the part and the phone will operate like normal and you can restore from a backup. TouchID isn't security though. It's merely an easier way to access your phone. "
"Fingerprint authentication is inherently insecure. Fingerprint scanners can be tricked and you leave your fingerprint literally everywhere. > If you replaced the Honda's ECU with a 3rd party computer, they wouldn't honor the warranty when the engine failed."
"But would they remotely de-activate your car for replacing it because it *might* fail?Except if you have a phone with TouchID, you don't have to use TouchID, and if you do use it, it forces you to set up a backup PIN/password. "
"So the correct solution here would have been to disable the fingerprint sensor and force you to use the backup PIN. There's no reason to lock down the entire phone because of this. This is a good point. It does feel wrong for Apple to do this without any warning though. It could be front and centre when you set up your fingerprints. A warning at that point about unauthorised repair would be much fairer.I might not understand the way it functions, but isn't the TouchID only one of several parallel security measures? Wouldn't bricking the ID scanner while allowing PIN login solve this problem completely?The primary security mechanism and key to encryption is still the password, and until very recently iPhones could only rely on that, as fingerprint reading was neither available nor necessary. If it doesn't trust the fingerprint any more, it can always fall back on having you enter your password. There's no reason to lock you out of your data, and even less reason to make the phone unusable, as long as you know your password.On the [Hacker News discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11049020) the assertion was made that on TouchID phones the PIN is stored in the same secure area as the fingerprint info.  Thus, if you can't trust the fingerprint info you couldn't trust the PIN.Right.  This is the difference between the ski resort posting warning signs saying you're going off the intended area, you could get hurt, and might die, etc, vs having a sensor release a pack of rabid wolves to kill you when you go outside the boundaries.It's not only anticompetitive, it's clearly unfit for the intended, and represented, use. There is a very good case for a consumer protection class action here, and since Apple is in CA, CLRA would clearly apply. Absolutely! It's as a transparent excuse as you could find to support this stunning anti-competitve business practice by Apple. There no reason they couldn't have a technician check the device in question and restore it if that were the case. If my bank has a question about recent charges on my credit card, they may block it, but a quick call to verify it hasn't been stolen and they re-activate it. There is literally no reason Apple couldn't do the same. This is unquestionably Apple's way to try and crush small business.sorry, we've been notified that you used your credit card in a store not approved by us, so we burned all of your money - sincerely, your bankI think the simple option would be to disable the sensor instead of disabling the phone. How does it protect your security not to allow you to use your numeric password?"
"Edit: someone pointed out that TouchID is rumored to use a more-or-less generic authentication key between the scanner and device to speed up authentication. If so, it's possible that the sensor cannot be deactivated as suggested.I've seen people argue that then Touch ID wouldn't be any more secure than just using a password. Which means they have missed the point entirely - your fingerprint is used for *ease of access,* not security. "
"Using something for security purposes that you a) cannot ever change and b) leave literally everywhere you go is a laughable idea. A fingerprint must be only a convenience layer on top of a rugged security layer that relies on much stronger methods to keep your data safe.This is why ~~Android~~ AOSP still requires you to enter your password/PIN/pattern upon boot, and intermittently during use, when fingerprint unlock is enabled. Fingerprint unlock is great for ease of use when you're reasonably sure adversaries don't have possession of your device, but it should never be the only thing keeping you safe... And with these devices containing nearly every bit of information about you, or at least the keys to that stuff, it's pretty critical you keep them secure."
"Additionally, I've read (on the internet, so it might be a lie) that the police cannot compel you to divulge a password under the fifth amendment, but they can compel you to use biometric devices. I set up a gesture on Nova Launcher to quickly lock my device in the event somebody (authority figure or criminal alike) demands I hand it over."
"EDIT: I suppose most flavors of Android do NOT do what I just said. Of course, there are only a few that even have fingerprint readers yet. I have a Nexus 6P, so I'm going off my experience with AOSP here. Having the fingerprint reader be your only means of security isn't very secure, I reiterate.Just for your (and others') information: iOS does the same thing. A 6 digit (or 4 digit pre-iOS 9) passcode is required to be configured if you use Touch ID, and it has to be entered after every boot, and at some regular interval, and after 5 consecutive failed Touch ID attempts.In other words: there exists no valid reason why the phone should brick. :)Why not just disable touch id and give users an alternative option to unlock their phone. Cant wait until apple rolls out their car in a few years and you get your tires changed at an unauthorized place and your car wont start up cause of safety/security concerns.If you set up TouchID you have to set up a backup PIN/password anyhow, so there's really no reason that they couldn't have just disabled the fingerprint sensor and forced you to use the backup PIN instead. In ALL cases, there HAS to be a backup password set. You can't only have TouchID. Before this update, this is exactly what happened. If the sensor was replaced, it was no longer valid, and iOS wouldn't recognize fingerprints or allow you to add new ones. Meanwhile, the home button worked just fine."
"So the solution is to roll back this update.Shame you can't roll back IOS versions. It used to be possible with the jailbreak, but it's not been possible at all for about 5 years. how do you dev test on older iOS versions without paying for dozens of iDevices?The Xcode iOS simulator. Given that this is true, does that make their justification a bold-faced lie?"
"**Edit: so bold, much face**No.  Being able to reinstall known good software is one thing.  However, the error 53 is thrown when you update the operating system.  The theory is that you could install something untrusted.> bold-faced"
"bald-faced, not **bold-**facedOr bald facedApple scewing people over no way?! Haha, I was down voted to oblivion in the last post but I don't care,  apple sucks. Nothing more secure than a brick.Well, its true that the best secret keeper is a dead man. Ok Then."
"If you acknowledge it is a security issue, then you can **HELP** your customers by veryfing their identity and get their devices back in working order instead of just **BRICKING IT.**"
"If you keep the device bricked, while its in posession of the actual owner, it's not a security feature: It's a **fault**.This is part of the deep problem of security. There isn't an answer to this problem.Often people forget that data security isn't just confidentiality. It's also integrity and access. If you destroy data you preserve privacy but violate both the principles of integrity and access."
"This is at minimum a denial-of-service and possibly even a data loss scenario. Consider this: I don't want someone reading my diary, but I would prefer that to having my house burn down.That's not the case for everyone though. Maybe my diary has all of my banking information in it and if someone reads it they can transfer all my money to themselves and then proceed to empty out my retirement account and transfer that to themselves. Who knows maybe I live in some broken down shitty house without power and have billions in assets that are tied up online."
"When you're designing for security you don't design for convenience, you design for the edge cases. Sure you personally might lose $500 but if that stops someone else from potentially losing millions then it sucks to be you but they should do it.Your horse threw a shoe and you went to an unauthorized blacksmith so we shot him. For your protection.You shot the blacksmith?!Police heard black and got trigger happy... But he did not shoot the deputy.... "
"Wait...Error 53 is clearly to protect security. The question is whether it's too drastic. The answer is not clear.It is drastic but necessary. It is necessary to make Apple encryption LEO, MIB and NSL proof. If Apple could unlock the device from error 53, It would mean Apple could unlock the phone arbitratily from full security lock down. Something Apple maintains it can't do, since to be able to do so, would be a back door they could be forced to use against their users. Their general approach to security and encryption related repairs is probably to factory wipe the device to completely empty (such as replacing touchID sensor) and then have the customer essentially enroll a completely new device (like they had just thrown the old out and bought a new one) and recover data from ICloud."
"Only way out of 53 error to unlocked files accessible device and filesystem should be valid authorization. Only valid authorization for device after enrolling are PIN and TouchID. Both probably handled by single Secure Element. So essentially compromising TID is also compromising PIN also. Both are just used to unlock one crypto secure elements operational lock. If apple can bypass that lock for example in order to recover data in Error 53 situation, it means they can do it when ever they want. Only way to ensure customer authorizzation for repaits etc. is PIN or TID. If PIN and TID are compromized the device has to nuke itself, since it has no way to verify the person asking for unlock in order to repair is customer and customer should be the only one capable of doing that. If Apple can do it for repair, they can do for a National Security Letter."
"Only way to fix this without local auth  is to rip the old sensor out and factory reset the whole damn device to empty state aka NUKE it and re born it as essentially factory new device with complete data loss. Then you recover the data from backup. If you have no backup, you are SOL."
"Only part where it is little iffy it, that theoretically Apple could allow Nuke it and then re-roll even with third party install. However it comes down to Secure Element trust. Their whole security model depends on that Secure Element not having back door. So in order to trust the phone again, they would have to rip out the third party unverified SE and install new one they trust.Error 53 is to make you pay money to feel happier. The argument that it's for security isn't totally true. Technically it's for security. But let's face it, they've handled other things so elegantly, why would they give you - their customer - such a hard time in this case?"
"Because they want you to know that you're better off paying premium dollars to them instead of going to the repair guy. "
"Or they'll introduce some certified repair guy credential that the repair guy will have to pay a lot of money for and in turn have to charge you more. "
"It's all about the money. Fuck the customer. The security it is there to protect is the security of Apple's income stream."
"Triggering it on an update makes no sense for user security. Bricking the phone makes no sense for user security."
"If the user previously had access to the phone with the third party components, taking access away suddenly on an update is not security. If they were a malicious third party they already had access to all the data and services of the phone.It'd make more sense if the error simply stated something about detecting a non-Apple approved repair or the like and that for security the Fingerprint scanner is now disabled; no bricking necessary. "
"That makes too much sense though. "
"Something's fucky with your finger print reader, you have to use the password you set up for cases when you burn/lose all your fingertips and can't scan them is how it should go.I have a pretty significant problem with the premise that single-factor biometric authentication is appropriate for high-security scenario *anyway*, so the idea that they're bricking phones over a reasonably-secure convenience feature is really out of whack to me."
"If the GUIDs don't match, shut it down as a primary form of authentication. I don't use fingerprints as primary authentication on any device with data that I actually want to secure anyway, so I'd be *ripshit* if I had an iPhone with important data bricked because of a GUID mismatch on a feature I don't use."
"I think there's a lot of justification for the anger here. That they can't re-pair the fingerprint reader to the security suite at the factory is simply inexcusable.Error 53 should just disable access to the phone via the fingerprints sensor. Just like it used to do. Just like the backup security feature of a password used to work in the previous version, the new version should also allow you to use a password to access your phone normally. "
"I wonder if my phone will be bricked even if I have never used the fingerprint access method. It's not clearly for security... It seems more like a bug that their PR people claim is a security feature. Consider the fact that the fingerprint scanner was already being blocked before the update if it was tampered with. The answer is very clear -- it's too drastic. There was Touch ID and Apple Pay on the iPhone 5S, and no error 53. ...How many stories did you hear about people having their bank accounts drained because they swapped out their home buttons? I bet I know the answer.So it's not clearly to serve Apple's interests, which was my first thought? And how it the answer unclear? Apple bricks your phone and destroys your data over a security flaw that has existed for months anyway via a *software* update without any fucking warning, and you're seriously asking if this is too drastic?The answer is only not clear to somebody who knows nothing about security. To everyone who does the answer is very clearly yes.I disagree. Since allowing the phone to function with touch ID disabled would be quite easy and just as secure, it's clear to me this is a thinly veiled attempt to cut out third party repairs.Apples end game: We've decided to lock you all out of your phones because you're a security risk. I do expect Apple to try and do enough to make it right, before this gets to big, but if it were to go to court, I would expect a class action settlement for violating the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act.  Apple will claim that it doesn't apply, because the device is disabled for security reasons, but I doubt that will make it very far in court, when almost every member of the class would be the original owner of the device.I call bs. If it was deliberate they wouldn't have used some random error code. They would explain why the phone won't boot anymore. is it?"
"or is it a way to protect apple service profits?Never attribute to malice that which can adequately be explained by stupidity."
"Sounds like an oversight. From what I'm seeing, Apple did the correct thing from a technical/security standpoint, but that doesn't necessarily align with what is the right thing from a customer service standpoint.With the ridiculous amount they make in phone sales, do you *really* think they'd risk this backlash over the profit-margins of their repair services?  Half the time they just give you a new phone, is that profitable for them?It's overkill for a phone for the majority of people."
"This reminds me of when I lost my battle.net authenticator and had to seriously fax in my driver's license... for a f'n video game. That's when I opted out for all this security on trivial things."
"The phones should have options whether or not to be used this securely, because 99% of people out there don't need to be locked out of their phones to protect some selfies and dirty texts.Spy plane hard drives self destruct if they are shot down over enemy territory. I would consider that an appropriate level of security."
"There were several generations of iPhone prior to this that functioned fine without fingerprint recognition. It would not have been beyond Apple to simply remove this feature if it were potentially compromised."
"It feels like a punitive measure for people going to non-Apple repair services.Given the fact that touch id security can be safeguarded or can be fixed without killing the phone I'd say it is beyond drastic. Upvote for you sir, because you're right. Repairing the Touch ID could be a a way compromise security, and users and developers rely on Touch ID's capability to not be spoofed.I agree with [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/02/05/error-53) on this one. "
">It seems very reasonable to me that iOS should check for a trusted Touch ID sensor. **But, if the sensor can't be trusted, clearly the whole phone should not be bricked -- it should simply disable Touch ID and Apple Pay**. And, obviously, it should inform the user why. Putting up an alert that just says Error 53 is almost comically bad.And the phone waits until the next IOS update before it detects that there's been a change.  So bad guys could only get a few months of fingerprint data.  Good security! /sMaybe Error 53 is to protect security, but the confusing way the error is handled and displayed suggests it's a software fuckup, not a deliberate feature. My guess is Apple didn't think to test what happened to modified phones with the update.Or they are using a particular kind of hardware to replace these touch IDs that Apple didn't test. Lots of things are possible, but it's probably *not* how Apple wanted it handled.From what I understand, These phones work perfectly fine until this update gets put on. It's at that point after the update that the phone locks out with this error."
"The update installer should query the touch pad and refuse to update if there is an issue. Advise the customer that in order to use that update they need to be repaired by a certified retailer."
"If I can think of this solution it must have been raised internally at apple and therefore this action was taken deliberately for some reason."
"Maybe they want to push the 'get your handset repaired by us or face a brick' in the loudest way possible. (news stories)"
"I've repaired thousands of iPhonesThe touch sensor for iPhone 5s, 6, and 6s has always been mated with the logic board. If you fuck up the cable coming from the touch sensor you're going to have a bad time. At best, touchID isn't going to work, worst - you prolly bricked it. This isn't something new. I don't particularly agree with it but there it is....If I accidentally drop my device and the fall damages my home button in some way, I should still be able to carry on updating my device instead of it becoming bricked. Especially when Apple is pushing these updates to my phone constantly, without my knowledge that it could potentially harm the phone."
"Edit: PunctuationI guess in the infinite realm of possibility, sure your home button could come unseated. It would just have to be reseated. It's a case of the home button being serialized to the logic board. "
"(I am in no way defending Apple, I've had android since the beginning)I've had a bunch of people that basically when the phone broke and started falling apart they picked the home button off and threw it away or lost it.  I recall fixing an iPhone 5S screen for a friend. The home button (with fingerprint sensor) was also damaged. However, after replacing the screen & button, Touch ID simply did not work (as we knew would happen), because the button and the motherboard had a mismatch. This is perfectly acceptable. Why they had to go 1 step further with this 'Error 53' nonsense is typical Apple. Hopefully there's enough pushback and bad press that they reverse their feelings on this. However, that's unlikely.Instead of bricking the phone why don't they just require you to enter your pin to reenable Touch ID?Because someone could have installed a modified sensor that steals your prints. They disable it because they can no longer prove it's an authentic sensor. Apple can't prove it's an authentic sensor, so now the phone is bricked.  Thanks Apple, for making that choice for me without even warning that such a choice was possible.>  Thanks Apple, for making that choice for me without even warning that such a choice was possible."
"Wait, isn't this what they've always done? The user should not face the dilemma of choice? :POh no, if a dodgy phone repair shop steals my fingerprint they'll be able to hack my iPhone, that I just dropped into their business, unlocked, so they could make repairs.Never mind the credit card information and countless passwords stored in it. Reddit's it's awesome.  They love that Apple is fighting to encrypt phones, but then when they find out it can inconvenience them they grab the pitchforks.   Because this merits it. No company is 100% good. There will always be some aspects of it that people hate. In this case, everyone loves that Apple is strong for security and loves their iPhone cameras. But, they hate this small aspect of it (which is reasonable). This applies to Google, Microsoft, everyone. No one is 100% good. Even humans. So, to choose a company or ecosystem, you have to weigh each company's good against it's bad.This is possibly the shoddiest implementation of encryption measures I've ever seen.Almost as if reddit was made of different people with different opinions.It's shit design not good security.That's a bit of a strawman. Nobody is upset that Apple is implementing encryption measures, they're upset at the shitty implementation and the lack of user control over how it functions.Really? Yeah, it's for security, sure, once Touch ID is broken you'll not be able to decrypt your data, it's gone forever, so you should at least be able to wipe the phone clean, install a fresh new OS, replace the Touch ID and start using an empty phone afresh."
"It need not be exactly like what I have said, but there are many ways Apple could have implemented this better. People here and comments like this are accepting that they could only implement it in this one way and they had no other choice. A different solution which could achieve the same level of security could have been more expensive for them to implement, the solution where your phone need not be bricked could have costed them more compared to this solution where the phone gets bricked. You're deluded. This isn't about security, it's about corporate policy.It's almost as if Reddit is made up of millions of visitors with differing opinions! It's almost like we can support some of a company's actions and not others. You can support them when they do things right, and criticize them when they do things wrong. "
"Besides, why are you lumping all Reddit users into one category? Certain people can praise them while completely different people can hate on them. Unless you are going through every single users profile and conclude that they quickly change their opinion on something.The thing that scares me more is the popularity of these kinds of comments that fundamentally misunderstand the concept that Reddit isn't one voice.  The people who love it and the people who hate this are possibly two very distinct groups.It's almost like millions of people have different opinions, weird.It's one thing to fight for better encryption. It's another thing to render a person's property useless when perfectly viable alternatives exist.I'm not letting someone outside of Apple work on my phone anyway, so I really don't give a shit. This does not effect me in anyway, and most of the people upset about it don't use Apple products to begin with. http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/44gao9/apple_says_iphone_error_53_is_to_protect_customers_security/czq08f3As an apple user, I'm cool with this. The fact this is the top comment is just Apple hate."
"Encryption is one thing, screwing up phones is another."
"Apple users like the encryption. They want it. They also want their phones to not be bricked over bullshit."
"Apparently you can't have common sense when people hate Apple. Pitchforks? The lack of common sense in your post and how many people agree with you? That's your pitchforks.If touchid is compromised, disable it and default to passcode.  No need to disable the entire device."
"It's really not that complicated folks.Well, most people on reddit don't really have the necessary technical knowledge to understand the underlying security concept of TouchID. So, it's just natural that they start grabbing pitchforks which is easier than reading and understanding complex security concepts.The technical knowledge to understand that several phone companies came out with this revolutionary technology years before Apple and have never had issues? Weird.There's two layers of security behind Touch ID. The first layer is in the software, including the storage of fingerprint data in the secure enclave of the device storage."
"The second is physical, and deals with ensuring the sensor is not skimmed. That is to say, I insert a small device between the sensor and the motherboard which allows me to capture your fingerprints undetected (similar to a device that captures your credit card information from an ATM)."
"As Apple continues to add more power behind Touch ID (it can already be used for Apple Pay purchases, in app purchases, App Store purchases, as well as in authenticating third party apps (such as quick login to your banking apps)) you can bet they're going to make sure this shit is locked down right. "
"Long story short, if you crack your screen, get it fixed anywhere - there's no problem with that. But if you break your Touch ID sensor or an inexperienced screen replacement technician fumbles with the Touch ID connections while replacing a screen, you're SOL until you pay a visit to Apple. I for one do not mind the added security here. I make purchases, sign into my banking apps, and unlock my front door with my fingerprint. Lock. It. Down. They could have easily put a warning before updating the OS saying your phone may be permanently disabled if you ever replaced the touchpad.  Well it isn't that complex. If you have related technical knowledge, could you explain a little?"
"It seems like there's an implicit logical flaw in allowing keypad login on a phone with an unbroken sensor, but not allowing keypad login on a phone with a replaced sensor. Can you fill in the details on why that's not the case here?The phone shouldn't even boot if it was about security. The phone boots and can work fine for months with a new or damaged home button. Only until an update or restore is done does it error 53.Apple knew about Touch ID vulnerability but failed to push security patch. Didn't want to upset unauthorized repair industry.The funny part is, while most people on subreddits like /r/news wouldn't know what they're talking about, they pretend they do. There's plenty of people over there claiming to be professional phone repairmen berating Apple over this, saying it's nothing more than anti-business practices. If you bring this up, they're 100% clueless as to what you're talking about. Almost as if they've never even opened up a phone in their lives or something.There are also plenty of people claiming incorrect things such as the TouchID sensor stores the fingerprint when it does not. All it does is transmits it securely to the processor. It is anti-business practice because changing the sensor does not give you free reign to log in as anyone, you need to reproduce a good hash of a fingerprint. The only security that it could possibly defeat is storing of the hash on another chip other than the processor which means they would need to gain physical access twice."
"EDIT: To people down voting me, maybe you would like to provide a source that counteracts what I say as the apple patent on it, prior technology they bought, and the apple website back me up on this.You can read the HN discussion. "
"The data is cached on the sensor and potentially more importantly, power can be  leached from the bus to attack the SoC elsewhere.I have read the discussion and looked at the entire pathway, they themselves clearly state that the secure enclave is on the a7 chip and not the sensor. [Here](http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/26/how-touch-id-and-secure-enclave-work/) is a good description of exactly what happens, compromising the sensor only allows one to possible exploit the bus which is a very sophisticated attack to disguise in a phone without the users knowledge. How is exploiting the bus or leaching power to do it elsewhere noticeable to the user?! Because you would need to be able to install hardware to leach the power, pack it into the phone, and then have the hardware to attack the SoC elsewhere without the user being able to see it. Seeing as most phones have barely any real estate period, packing such extra hardware without it being obvious is a tall task.There's plenty of room for these attacks."
"You could thin out the inset for the apple logo or  remove some shielding or use the space in the home button to hide additional processing. All the space that is needed to touch other areas of the chips are just very thin wires which will fit just about anywhere."
"Mind you, Apple is concerning itself with corporate and state level adversaries here. If you think that the security trade off is not worthwhile that's your opinion but it doesn't make their decision unreasonable. Where are you going to carve out enough to not only power, but also store an exploit these methods. The button is not hollow enough to store the extra information and still function nor is the apple logo to store the extra processing. You are correct in that the wires will fit but its the other necessary hardware to perform the attack that's not likely. There simply is not enough free room to make these modifications without it being fairly obvious to the user."
"As you state they are worried about corporate or state level attacks which they would look for should these be possible. But as has been stated, its immensely easier to just take a fingerprint than to concoct some nano scale processor and wires they might not tip off the user.Holy shit, you people think James Bond is a documentary.technician here:"
"I agree, reddit has no idea how encryption works.Being a mechanic doesn't make you an engineer. There is some discussion over on /r/mobilerepair about it. We've known about the issue since shortly after the iPhone 6 landed.Or Apple could simply disable Touch ID?Because it's tied physically to the secure zone."
"They probably changed their policy to prevent against more complicated forms of the attacks such as ones that just steal the fingerprint data or try to attack the chip elsewhere by leaching power/data.With ApplePay your iPhone becomes a credit card and as such it should be subject to the same security standards as real credit cards."
"I'm pretty sure the credit card companies required the increased safety standards for their partnership with Apple."
"I therefore think there should not be any way to circumvent this extra security. If the security is compromised, the phone should stop working.The phones are being bricked by an update. Anyone could have stolen anything in the last many months. This just harms owners. You shouldn't be able to browse the internet or make calls with your phone just because your TouchID doesn't work? Apple could just disable the functions which require high security without it affecting everything else. You obviously don't know a lot about how computers/phones work.Because if that were the case, people would still bitch. The inevitable headline would be:"
"Researchers gain full access to iOS and stored credit card data after swapping out TouchID sensor."
"Followed by you saying: Well why wouldn't Apple just disable access completely if the TID were changed? What a shitty company."
"You obviously don't know a lot about how phones work........ Jesus Christ...."
"Im not saying whether or not Apple is making the right choice, only that whatever they do it would be wrong according to the outspoken Reddit base. Why not just disable the NFC payment part of the phone?"
"There's no need to brick the whole fucking thing.This has to be the reason they did it. If not they would've bricked iPhone 5s' as well, but they didn't because those don't have Apple pay. Home buttons are like, $7 on Amazon. Apple probably feared that someone could modify a new button so that it always sent a yes signal to the phone and peoples bank accounts could easily be drained. Maybe they found a way to clone a synced button on top of that, so the only way to prevent fraud is to brick the phone and get people to bring them in to be repaired or replaced. "
"I'm not happy about it, but it might not be as nefarious as people are making it out to be.This is what already happened in the previous version of iOS. Changing the home button would cause touch ID to be disabled.It's not the touchID that's the issue. It's having a nuke protocol that's easily tripped on a device that's celebrated by its userbase for *not* being as fragile as Android. But this shit happens and the, oh apple is just high level tech you wouldn't understand folks are out in droves. This isn't an acceptable issue.Even if there is a technical reason to do so, Apple should have warned users that the phone would stop working. This feature came without any warning.It's almost as if people like one action of a company but dislike another, and act accordingly.  At least you can't accuse them of blindly following the cult of Apple.Fighting for encryption and implimenting it in a shitty way are completely different thing. No reason they need to be mutually exclusive. If it were about security, there are ways apple could have implemented it without bricking the user's phone.  For example, if the invalid cable had been detected, they could have forced you to input your password.  At least that way you could get into your phone.  They should also allow the user to override the error after entering their password so they can continue using the phone as normal."
"Bricking a phone, forcing you to lose any photos and files if they ~~are~~ **aren't** (edit: typing is hard) synched to icloud, that should simply not happen.I like how they launched a broken phone trade in program right after this. That's not what it already does? From the article:"
">If iOS finds a mismatch, the check fails and Touch ID, including for Apple Pay use, is disabled. "
"This left me under the impression that the phone still works fine but you can't use TouchID. Um. That's not how encryption works. What good is encryption if it can just be bypassed?Jesus everyone is up in arms about whether the TouchID 3 years ago could possible be a security flaw now 3 years later people are complaining that the TouchID enclave is too secure. What do you want secure phone or insecure phone with the ability to swap your parts. You can't have both.The phone isn't bricked technically bricked. The phone is encrypted. You have no way of decrypting it now, because you tampered with it. This wouldn't have happen if you took it to a place that knew what they were doing.Well, that's why you back up things on your phone. And it doesn't even have to be to iCloud.  "
"Its not Apple's fault that you fucked up your phone enough that the home button no longer works.  That's like crashing your car and being pissed at GM because the things in your glove compartment got messed up.Except that maybe for security reasons, they want you to know that your phone has been tampered with?Yes, I'm sure you know more than Apples own technicians that designed the phone.Precisely, any other device with finger print ID on it has an option you can toggle for it to wipe itself upon detecting something like this.Maybe access to the secure area on the chip can somehow get access to the passcode making what you suggest insecure. Agreed. In this case, Apple should have taken the TPM/KNOX approach to design. Each iPhone TouchID Sensor and SoC are paired together uniquely as they are currently. Should the TouchID sensor or it's bus be improperly replaced, or become unreachable (common when the front glass is severely damaged, the phone will behave similar to tripping Samsung's KNOX eFuse. The phone will still work, however TouchID will become permanently disabled even if the original sensor is reinstalled, all fingerprint data stored in the SoC will become both unreadable and destroyed, and services which require the TouchID sensor will become unusable. It doesn't leave you stranded with a device that cannot call emergency services, and it doesn't defeat/break iOS 9's encryption scheme. If anything Apple's current design introduces an additional security hole.There should be a way to prove you own the phone and unlock it. Simply typing in a passcode isn't good enough once Touch ID has been compromised. The problem is now that it has been replaced it could be doing all sorts of nasty stuff based on how unscrupulous the unauthorized fixer is. It would no longer be secure, but I do agree they need to find a better solution. They're probably more worried about someone replacing the TouchID sensor with something that can extract the fingerprint data from the enclave, more than the security of the phone. I think it's more to do with faking the authentication and therefore making purchases without the owners consent. That can't be done after a restart anyway, without a password. That's all software though. They're talking about hacking the physical authentication process to okay a payment. If the authentication is compromised then someone could authenticate a purchase online or in a store for any amount. "
"While this is may seem extreme, it really has to be. There is so much sensitive information on an iPhone to even allow unauthorized repairs from a user standpoint doesn't make sense. "
"An authorized service provider would require all data be backed up and the phone be restored/ wiped prior to service, if it isn't, then they usually end up doing it anyways (via restore or reset) for security and privacy purposes. Apple or the service provider are not in charge of preserving your data during a repair. "
"1.10.2 It is your responsibility to backup all existing data, software, and"
"programs, and to erase all existing data before receiving services. -http://images.apple.com/legal/sales-support/terms/repair/generalservice/Service_Terms_English.pdf"
"So why does it make sense from a lack of warranty stance to go to an Apple Authorized Service Provider? My phone is out of warranty already. I just need a cheap repair to get my phone working again. We'll, let's answer this: What makes a repair so cheap? Is it labor? It varies but most phone repairs don't take more than a few minutes to hours depending on the skill level of the repairer. Maybe you know the person? Great. Give them this link: https://www.apple.com/lae/support/programs/aasp/"
"Well the largest contributor is parts. Apple's parts do cost more and although there are substitutes that do the same things as the original but with a different approach to material or manufacturing, Apple's have been tested by Apple to work. Here's what many people don't realize: It is the parts of a phone that have a warranty. When Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider services your phone you either get 90 days or the remainder of your warranty (whichever ends up being more time) to make sure that the repair was done correctly and to ensure you that all parts used will function as designed. "
"Service Warranty. For all service orders, Apple warrants to the extent permitted by"
"law that (1) services performed will conform to their description for ninety (90) days from the date of service -http://images.apple.com/legal/sales-support/terms/repair/generalservice/Service_Terms_English.pdf"
"So you go from no warranty to at least some warranty. Where if you go the unauthorized service provider route, they could be putting anything into your device, you just don't know. It could last for a day to maybe three months, again, you don't know. At least with Apple you are guaranteed parts that work for three months and, in my experience, anything that lasts three months usually makes it the rest of the year. "
"TL:DR You can't shortcut security just to get a cheap repair done. Unauthorized service providers who do not use certified Apple parts could be putting any number of unauthorized parts into your phone to do who knows what. With an Apple Authorized Service Provider, the parts come from Apple and if your phone doesn't have a warranty you get a small 90 warranty to ensure everything is working."
"The screens are mostly original refurbs. Only just very recently did aftermarket iphone 6 lcd panels hit the market. I see plenty of other original apple parts get supplied to us as well, as the components are too difficult to reverse engineer and clone.>You can't shortcut security just to get a cheap repair done. Unauthorized service providers who do not use certified Apple parts could be putting any number of unauthorized parts into your phone to do who knows what. With an Apple Authorized Service Provider, the parts come from Apple and if your phone doesn't have a warranty you get a small 90 warranty to ensure everything is working."
"And that's a great idea in the first world, but as other articles have pointed out, not every country has AASPs.It's not just about losing photos, your phone is entirely bricked. Some people don't much care about security and are willing to risk taking their phone for repair, knowing that some information could possibly be stolen. That doesn't mean they want their phone to be made into a paperweight. This is a huge disaster for Apple, and it WILL be fixed. This is a PR game for now to hold off angry customers until a fix can be implemented.you do know you can replace a screen and keep the original touch ID sensor and cable, correct? If the technical can handle a heathen well, they can still do this unauthorized, it's just a extra risk. When a user can override encryption you might as well and simply take that feature out of the product. That's not how security works. Disk and file encryption is one of the hardest features to implement without affecting the user because there is no middle ground. You either fully encrypt and remember your damn password or say fuck it and don't. Anything in the middle is a waste of everyone's time. Image that some of those parts had been skimming the key data for all those phones? Can you image the outage at Apple as people said  well I didn't know something was wrong I just got some stupid error message I didn't know what it meant. "
"You all need to relax your Apple hate and learn about security first. On an iPhone you can *always* get around TouchID and type your passcode/password in. If fact if your TouchID failed to authenticate too many times (wet finger, wrong finger, etc) it will just force you to type password."
"This indicates that their security model has always assumed password entry to be a valid way to authenticate (e.g. They can't use TouchID as a 2 factor)."
"If so there should be nothing wrong with disabling just the TouchID sensor. Imagine you are an attacker. If you know the password you are already in the system anyway so turning off just the TouchID loses nothing on the security assumptions. In fact you are just reducing a vector of attack since password is always allowed anyway.It sounds like just a scam to make sure that all parts are always from Apple. The luxury business model.After a software update a charging cable I was using caused an error.  The friggin' charging cable!  I wasn't trying to sync, I was using an apple plug, but it refused to pull electricity to charge because the wire wasn't apple licensed!  That's going too far.That's a shitty cable you're using. They don't stop third party cables and chargers. [deleted]Your just catching on to this now? It was apparent when Apple decided to drop the universal chargers and make their own so customers would have to buy from them and only them.They were using the same proprietary connectors they had since the iPod days, I'm not sure where this universal chargers notion comes from.Anyone could make that connector and have it work if it fit properly and was wired correctly. Now there's an authentication chip in every cable.is that why my cheap ass off brand iphone charger wont work when its plugged into my computer? I'm using a cable I bought from the gas station, working just fine It's almost as if they've been doing this stuff for ages. I remember everyone always getting new ipods because they broke within 2 years mostly. Meanwhile I had a zen that lasted me 5 years. It may still work, I just stopped using it when it became obsolete. "
"Edit: Oh no, I have angered the almighty apple fanboy. so your one good experience with a zen means apple was scamming people with ipods.  ok.A vast majority of tech users don't upgrade their gadgets when they break...they update them when something newer/fancier comes out.  2 years I would wager is a long time to replace an electronic device such as an iPod or phone...it doesn't mean it doesn't work.  I still have an old iPhone 4 that I use for my second phone number. I think we're running on, what, 6 years now? I can't update the software anymore, and it's slow compared to my newer iPhone, but it works great still. You haven't angered the almighty apple fanboy but you said that you remember everyone always getting new ipods because they broke within 2 years MOSTLY. So, you said an absolute, then you said mostly, and it's anecdotal evidence to begin with, which makes it..... total bullshit. Your experience with a zen is also anecdotal. Next time you want to say something like this, back it up with actual evidence. How... How do you even browse reddit with those terms that you just set?Don't question him or apple you fucking simpleton! ^^^/sMy iPod didn't get wireless operating system updates that bricked it though. Over 10 years later, and my iPod still works fine. It's battery is shoddy (only about an hour's worth playing music), but since I can just keep it plugged in, it's fine."
"And you haven't angered fanboys. That iPod is the only apple product I have. But what you're saying is irrelevant to the discussion, that's all.You're not putting shady 3rd party parts that can potentially capture and transmit your fingerprints on that iPod either.Og iPod in my truck still running. Cables break all the time though.Mine eventually broke just because I had used it so much."
"To be clear, the only thing that broke is the headphone port."
"Man . . . if only Apple could redesign that. ;)If it's an oldie classic, you should try fixing it yourself. Not as hard as you think !Just like most things Apple does.Or, it's to make it ACTUALLY secure. Not 'sort of secure' or 'mostly secure' but *actually* secure.Well it's not all parts is it? It's just the home button with touch sensor. No, because if you had read and done research before this, the Apple reps themselves can't even replace a faulty Touch ID sensor. "
"The mainboard and Touch ID are paired at the factory and cannot be done anywhere else. They have to replace both the mainboard and the Touch ID sensor to be able to correctly work. Even then, getting a new phone would likely be cheaper than the repair."
"But, once again like all Reddit hate for Apple misinformed and flat out idiotic statements are the forefront of mass thought.Yes, and how much more do you pay apple to replace that main board, which would not need to be replaced if they had written the firmware differently?  It's a racket.  Oh, people are going to much less expensive third parties to replace their parts at half cost?  Fine, we'll force our customers to only use our authorized replacement parts and our authorized repair facilities so we can keep charging them more money.  Makes a great case for switching to android.Sounds exactly like the Xbox 360: motherboard and DVD daughterboard are paired with the same serial number. The drive can only play DVDs if there is a mismatched. Not bricked per se, but definitely can't function as a game-disc playing console. > No, because if you had read and done research before this, the Apple reps themselves can't even replace a faulty Touch ID sensor. "
"Ok, who said the reps? The company is not a rep, it is the company. So what you're saying is the company that makes its own phone cannot fix it? That's actually not a question, that is what you're saying and the only thing to do is replace.No true, in store repairs at the Apple Store repair and change this numberI cracked the glass on my iphone 6 plus. They repaired it, but they replace the whole screen assembly. So because they designed something at the factory that ultimately breaks their phones for legitimate customers (a poor decision) we're supposed to just shut up about it? "
"Apple fanboys. Sweet mercy.Literally how the fuck is what you said defending apple?  the Apple reps themselves can't even replace a faulty Touch ID sensor. literally means apple engineered their phones in such a way that a **broken button** requires a whole new fucking phone. Of course it should. TouchID isn't just an input device, it's part of the whole security enclave that sits on board that stores your fingerprint, encryption keys, etc. if you can just replace it the entire security measure would be meaningless[deleted]> But, once again like all Reddit hate for Apple misinformed and flat out idiotic statements are the forefront of mass thought."
"I have no horse in this race and just found out about this issue but... How can you insult people so much and talk as if this:"
"> The mainboard and Touch ID are paired at the factory and cannot be done anywhere else. They have to replace both the mainboard and the Touch ID sensor to be able to correctly work. Even then, getting a new phone would likely be cheaper than the repair."
"Was something to be lauded..."
"Why in the hell would you not design a failsafe into the system to avoid *the exact scenario that has just happened?*That still doesn't change the fact that the fingerprint activation could be disabled and it could function as a normal iPhone minus that one small function, that's like setting my car on fire because the remote central locking isn't working when I could still just push the things down.How is that any better? Why would you make an entirely superfluous system arbitrarily integral to the function of the phone other than to force people to just keep buying more? The phones were working fine after repairs until Apple decided to brick them.And they designed it to be that way. How is that a good thing?So if somebody steals it they can't just replace the Touch ID to gain access. Since the fingerprint is tied to the Touch ID and control board you could conceivably put in your own fingerprints. Since the os doesnt know what the fingerprints look like. I hate Apple for creating overpriced machines that aren't built to last long.  Is that misinformed and flat out idiotic?This is incorrect. I worked at an Apple Store as a Genius and all that needs to be done is replace the whole Display and re-pair the touch ID using the tools provided.So Apple is just incompetent.I don't quite get how you think that makes it not a luxury business modelAlthough, you in fact are misinformed. Apple Stores use screen assemblies and replace the button and digitizer all at once whenever a screen is swapped out. I've taken several with replacement home buttons and they give me the same phone back with a working TouchID.The touch sensor is a luxury, it is not required. If the phone senses that the sensor has been tampered with, the correct action to take is to turn off the sensor. Then people can still access their phone using the passcode, like they could with any other pre-sensor iPhone."
"Instead Apple took a swipe at people trying to repair the devices, because they need to keep sales up, and people repairing the devices for cheap is eating into their revenue of selling replacements. They don't want people to be able to repair the phone and use it for years, they want to force you to keep buying new ones.Compare that to the S5 with charging ports that regularly crap out from extended use due to cheap manufacturing coupled with a phone that is only internally repairable by busting out the lcd and digitizer. What should be a 5 dollar repair turns into a ~300 dollar repair."
"Edit: they're all businesses out to make a buck, apple isn't some evil sub species of corporation.The touch sensor is part of a chip/system called the secure enclave - the last line of defense on your phone. Pre-sensor is meaningless; pre-secure-enclave is what matters."
"This is why your fingerprint data is secure from attackers. It literally never leaves the chip - the OS just asks the enclave to check for a known fingerprint. The enclave will only test a few failed fingerprints before it locks down and waits for your password, making it ~impossible for attackers to brute force it. Same goes for your PIN."
"The secure enclave also holds all of the on-boot decryption keys and other extremely sensitive data."
"If the OS/mainboard trusts a compromised enclave it could possibly be used to compromise - or cheaply rebuild - stolen phones. At least that's what I'm guessing - it's in line with how Apple has handled similar problems in the past."
"I'm dramatically oversimplifying here; Apple has a great and detailed doc on the subject: https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf"
"EDIT: slight clarification."
"EDIT: clarified what I meant by secure fingerprint data.>the last line of defense on your phone"
"I like to imagine the secure enclave as a guy in a room full of secret files, pointing a shotgun at a closed door and waiting for a legion of criminals to break in and steal the secrets. All the other defenses may have failed, but no one's gonna get past him. This needs to be higher. The main reason this is the way it is is to make sure a stolen phone can't be used. This thread is full of people too fucking stupid to see what's clearly an anti-NSA type device giving people trouble. "
"Apple went to extreme engineering levels to ensure that they couldn't just swap the home button with one of their hacked ones and generate a fake but valid key to get into your device. "
"This is GOOD and more companies need to start thinking this way. Can imagine the headlines and comments if it was found that you can hack into any iPhone by just replacing the home button?Apple Stores have a special calibration fixture that can pair a new touchID sensor. Otherwise they couldn't do display replacements since Touch ID is built into the display assembly.On the contrary, Apple repair stores have the ability to repair any Apple-made TouchID sensor with any mainboard."
"The problem with third-party touch sensors is that they're third party and Apple, and neither should you, trust any third-party fingerprint readers if your fingerprint gives the device so much access.This is absolutely correct. Source: I work for an AASP.So, if the home button/touch sensor needs replacing, the whole phone is unrepairable?Basically the top part. Display, camera and a few other things.Sounds expensive.Sounds like Apple A simple warning when you set up your fingerprints would be nice.No, they can't.  The only guarantee of security from them would be that they know they installed a signed/certified piece of hardware or running an app certified cryptographically from the App Store. A third party install of hardware/software doesn't guarantee it's safe/secure.  It's part of the Apple experience - you know you're getting a secure and private device that Apple won't compromise.  The second they start letting these modified iPhones out in the world is the second their ecosystem is in trouble.  YOU may know what's in it, but if you sold it you now have a customer who doesn't realize their phone isn't 100% secure."
"TouchID is tied directly to accessing everything in your phone, your account, and your credit card.  Modifying it by a third party completely compromises it.  Even though Apple can say hey we didn't do it, don't blame us - that's now how consumers work.  They see an iPhone, they see Apple. They don't care who refurbished it.  So since it's not officially sanctioned by Apple, it can't guarantee it's safe.  Remember the Snapchat flub a year ago when 1000s of snaps were released?  Well, that had nothing to do with Snapchat, rather a 3rd party app people used to save snaps.  Even though it was quickly found out it wasn't Snapchat that was compromised rather the most popular 3rd party app that wasn't sanctioned by them, it was big blowback on Snapchat.  "
"When it comes to security, it's best you don't cut corners or have any exceptions in anyway if your reputation is on the line.  One security vulnerability can cost billions and bring down your company.  Target lost billions and it's still unknown exactly how much it cost them indirectly in their breach.  The iCloud leak was because of shitty passwords, but Apple still took flack because people thought the iCloud itself was hacked - even though it was quickly fond it was done via social engineering and shitty passwords.  Apple still had to invest millions into more security to protect themselves and make people feel a little safer after that.  They're not about to cut corners and let flawed iPhones repaired without any sort of certification go into their consumers' hands."
"It's about protecting the consumer and their image.I don't particularly like that my phone might brick if I send it in for repairs, but I can see the logical pattern that may bring about such a situation."
"TouchID seems to be a self-contained bit of hardware in the phone, where the prints are stored on a physical level and paired with some software id markers. "
"Someone could very easily switch whichever part is used to 'house' the fingerprint scans and have access to your phone at a later time. Hence all of this talk about re-validating your TouchID when there is a replacement part inserted. Perhaps it might be easy to say, 'just shut off touchID and don't fuck up my entire phone'. But someone must've come to the conclusion that if your phone's already been compromised in such a way, then it would be more secure to brick the phone than to let someone continue accessing it without fingerprint recognition. "
"to the ordinary user it wouldn't matter and might be a nuisance. But think of all the companies that give employees iphones for work purposes. It might be a real problem if someone's phone with sensitive information fell into the wrong hands, and the thief could just keep fucking around with the phone until he/she found a way in. It's the same logic behind the 10 password tries option.But the password is always the backup option.  In fact, when you first start up your phone it is the only option.  This is independent of touchid.  Therefore, they could simply disable touch id, and require you to enter your password to get into your phone without bricking it.  No. When entering the password you are using a backup option to access your decryption key. Touch ID unlocks your KEY file, which is what the password will also do. Your key is then used to authenticate with the key on the Touch ID chip. This is a separate co processor and using the pin still uses it (which is the technologically correct and secure thing to do). During start up like any security system it tests to see if any part of it could be vulnerable. If this dos anything but fully brick the phone it would be a complete security flaw and would probably also eventually be used to break into people's phone by bypassing the functionality. This is how security works. Do you want encryption? Why do you think self encrypted hard drives have been made for so long and are in many people's computers but are only utilized by .5% of them? Encryption is not a joke. It can brick your device, it can delete all your data, but if it didn't it would be so damn useless."
"I will not be surprised when all android devices that use touch authentication are announced to have the same flaw because of they don't enjoy a useless and insecure device.What if I've never enabled touchID on my phone...?That's part of why TouchID requires your passcode after restarting your iPhone as anybody who has ever restarted an iPhone will know. If you open up a phone and install a TouchID sensor which can be cheated, it won't even be usable the first time you turn on the phone after re-assembling it. And this brings up the same question everybody else raises: disabling the TouchID sensor (but not the phone) when it may have been altered makes sense... It makes so much sense that Apple built this into the normal reboot cycle of the phone. Why not not do the same in the situation which is causing this error?I'll explain it again. Touch ID and the passcode perform the same function. You have a key located in the secure coprocessor, this key is itself encrypted with both your passcode and Touch ID data, both unlock it. When this key is unlocked the KEY is used to decrypt your data and validate. This is how full disk encryption works and how it has worked on all other devices that allow full disk encryption. Allowing a 3rd party part into the system allows people to introducing devices that could be used for reverse engineering that system or even worse. It's really simple security and I would bet that any other phone that uses a touch sensor with a security coprocessor will work the same.You have failed to explain the dichotomy, though. The iPhone isn't bricked by replacing part of the TouchID chain of trust and rebooting, it's bricked by replacing that part and then updating to a specific version of the operating system. Realistically, these two actions should have the same outcome. Why don't they?My guess would be that this is to protect against a use case outside of a replaced Touch ID with a spoofed one. Maybe one that we can't consider simply out of ignorance to the full implementation to this feature. Alternatively the error just shuts off TouchID completely, then requires you to change your password.  Then it continues popping up anytime you unlock your phone to let you know that TouchID has been disabled.  Want the convenience of TouchID back?  Go to an Apple store.  Can't get to an Apple store?  Well you'll be annoyed by the error, but the phone is still usable until you get to an Apple store."
"For that matter, could always just make it so the phone uploads anything on it to iCloud then deletes it all until you confirm your identity or something.>just make it so the phone uploads anything on it to iCloud"
"No. At least not anything without consent. I mean, the fappening was great and all, but should Apple be forcing people to use their service which has been breached (and is probably still being breached to this day to get random nudes?)? Right now you have the option to not upload your stuff to the iCloud. A prompt to change that setting as a way to save data in the event of Error 53 would be reasonable though.Fair enough.  I'm mostly looking at options for people to get their data back instead of simply bricking the phone.If you're talking about the celeb nudes that were leaked it was done by brute forcing password attempts and getting security question answers from Facebook/google. They've chosen less stupid questions and forced them to be changed, set a cap on password attempts, and enacted two step verification.It wasn't breached. It was shitty passwords and social engineering.  Apple has since enacted 2-factor authentication and verification of accessing. People still don't use those controls. It's all you can do to prevent stupid people from having their crap stolen.  "
"This is why Apple refuses to cut corners on allowing jailbroken phones or phones that have been repaired by a 3rd party (mainly their security 'lock', Touch ID). People are stupid, and no matter how hard they explain in a way a 1st grader can understand, people won't understand why their iPhone allowed someone in Russia to steal their information and credit cards.  Not saying that'll happen, but it's a known unknown - they're preventing the possibility of a 0-day. Touch ID is built into the hardware tightly.  Software can only guarantee so much.  They can't just turn it off 100% securely.  It may be 99.9% secure, but that 0.1% isn't worth the risk to their brand reputation. Keep the walled garden reputation, and avoid another Fappening reputation.The exploit on Apple's end was that iCloud had no limit on how many password guesses you had which is what allowed the hackers to brute force the affected accounts in the first place. Quite a major security flaw for a service that, by default, automatically sucks up all your personal data when you setup an iPhone.> Reddit's it's awesome"
"Reddit is it is awesome?Yea I read it that way 3 times and gave upIt's not about inconvenience. Apple has user defined backup pin code and/or password to allow users to get into the phone (especially when the phone is restarted). There are other ways of securing the phone. Yes, replacing the touch ID sensor by unauthorized repair shops should void the warranty and disable the touch ID capability, but it should not brick the whole phone when updated."
"Edit: also keep in mind if the passcode is entered wrong a certain number of times, the phone will brick and the user could even set it to wipe the phone. So the security argument is a total moot point.Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tOaWuvTjFg) that explains what error 53 is. It's worded rather aggresively but explains the issue.Amazing how he climbs up the octaves as the video goes on.It's worded aggressively but he's not wrong. I've repaired many iPhones and most people tell me that they're here because apple won't help them at all. Like the guy said in the video, I get screwing over the people that repair Iphones but its absolute bull shit that they're now screwing over the end user. > It's worded rather aggresively"
"A little bit of an understatement.This video is from last October... How long has this been going on? Why is it now all over my front page? I was curious as well so I jumped over to Apple's official forum and found [this thread on the front page](https://discussions.apple.com/message/27166921#27166921) dated Sept. 29 **2014**. At 190k views it's obviously a large problem but yeah I wonder why it only recently got so much attention. Because The Guardian wrote about it due to one of their (editors?) getting hit by it and thus the BBC picked it up too."
"So yeah, basically it hit the media hard in the last week.Exactly. You don't want to mess with a secure system like touch id. Better to brick it."
"Just make sure your hand isn't  photographed:"
"http://www.tomsguide.com/us/iphone-touch-id-hack,news-20066.htmlExecute order 66I posted this in the other thread also.  Error 53 only occurs when your original Touch ID home button is damaged or removed.  No other repairs will result in this error at all, unless you somehow rip the flex cable leading to the home button or leave it disconnected.[Emperor Appletine](http://i.imgur.com/neUK19l.jpg)I see quite a lot of bitching going on."
"I have a simple solution; if you don't like what Apple is doing, don't buy another iPhone."
"If enough of you stop buying their products, sales will drop dramatically, and Apple will either find a better way to handle this issue or say We're doing things this way because fuck you while their profits drop."
"Pro-tip: this little stop buying shit you don't like trick works on any company.They can't. They haven't bought the one that broke yet. They have loan out on it. It's not that it shuts down. That would we a security feature. That the phone bricks and is now useless is the problem. If you could take it to an authorized Apple store and have it reset that might be a good feature. Needing to buy a new phone and to lose everything on your old one is just wrong. "
"Never had an Apple product and never will.that's so broad, one could say that the chain of events leading to Apple making more money leads to better job security for Apple, and thus better security for the customer, because they still have Apple as an option for their device purchase."
"therefore, the more their product breaks and causes the customer to be required to have Apple fix it, the better security for the customer."
"profit logicMy phone is jailbroken. Does this mean I am protected against it? I only update when there's a jailbreak for it (still using 9.0.2). Can you update using a custom built firmware that doesn't contain the check?That's why I protect my security by not buying any more Apple crap.The fingerprint is essentially such a bad method of securing a phone that the phone has to have complicated internal compromises in order to protect the fingerprint data. "
"Even if you don't use the fingerprint reader, you are inconvenienced by its security problems. > The fingerprint is essentially such a bad method of securing a phone"
"It is better than not having any PIN, which is the exact problem it set out to solve. Some people were refusing to set a PIN because they found it too inconvenient to enter the PIN each time. Apple now allows them to use fingerprint instead of nothing, which is an improvement. For people who are anal about security and who already used a complex PIN and were acceptable to that, they are best off continuing as they were. You still need a PIN every time you reboot the phone. "
"Also a fingerprint is something you have, leo can force you to provide it vs something you know, which is protected by the Fifth Amendment. Biometrics can be a username, but should never be a password.what makes it so bad?If someone steals it, you can't change your fingerprint.err...what? i think im missing something obvious here. wouldn't you not want them to be able to change the fingerprint if its stolen?What he (or she) is saying is you can't change your fingerprint password because you can't change your fingerprint. It's the underlying weakness with retina and fingerprint security systems is there is one pattern for you that works. Once that password is stolen or recreated by someone else with ill intent you can't change it to a different one.That's why retinas and fingerprints are for authorization, not authentication.Authorisation is not concerned with discerning identity, that's authentication. Apple TouchID devices use fingerprints to identify the user, ergo they are using fingerprints for authentication."
"Authorisation is merely concerned with the application and enforcement of claims against an identity.Other way around. Authentication is proving who you are. Authorization is determining if you are authorized to perform an action. Authorization is often determined based upon the value of the given resource/action. You may be authorized to perform certain low-risk actions with poor authentication such as single-factor fingerprint or retina but more secure actions will require multiple authentication factors (something you have AND something you know).Not only that. If you damage them enough, you won't be able to access your files.You leave fingerprints all over your phone and everything else, they can easily be turned into a fake fingerprint that you can use to unlock any device.You can also get fingerprints from a picture of your hand. Why does every single post here neglect the fact that the article states that phones that haven't even had the sensor worked on are still being bricked by this error. Doesn't that fact alone almost make it seem that Apple is just making up a bs excuse?While we're on the topic of Apple purposefully sabotaging their phones, there's also something that came with the iPhone 6 called long screw damage. There is a plate that covers the screen / camera / home button cables that is screwed down.  In the previous series (Iphone 5s and lower) you could accidentally mess up where each screw went and it'd be okay.  Well in the 6 and higher they put tiny traces under where these screw into.  They also made 1 screw 0.5mm longer than the others (can't tell without a microscope the different size). If you put the wrong screw in it'll screw down too far and break this trace and make the screen not work until fixed which is a very hard repair.  Apple car owners in the future: I tried to change the wiper blades on my own and now my car won't start. Error 53Garbage.  Disabling the  fingerprint sensor would do that.  They're protecting their walled garden service system.> They're protecting their walled garden service system."
"no shit."
"They are going after defense and security contracts. You think they can get them if 3rd parties are able to service the phone?It should disable touch ID. Not brick the phone. Just require your passcode if the sensor isn't the one thats supposed to be there.It's a design flaw they are masquerading as a security feature.how is it a design flaw?Single point of failure So do you consider the battery, cpu, lock button, and screen to be design failures too? You can't have redundancy of every feature on a cell phone people want to be very small.Those things are inherent necessities for the phone to function. A fingerprint scanner is notSo you would rather the secure enclave be authenticated by multiple entities instead of just the touch ID?You can have a better security system that doesn't require touch id as an alternative You fools.  Do you know anything about private keys?  Have you even heard of private keys?"
"Please...[RTFM](https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf)"
"Here's a hint: The private keys on iPhones are hardware based.Then disable touchid and require a password. Bricking is the wrong choice hereUgh....jeez.  Does no one care these days to educate themselves before making baseless claims?"

"If you still don't understand, then that is a sign that you shouldn't hold an opinion on the matter."
"edit: typoHave you read the original article? You can replace the TouchID sensor, and the phone will continue working with the PIN until it is updated to the latest OS."
"Let's imagine that the TPM is indeed on the TouchID sensor: the user tries the PIN and the private key is nowhere to be found. Obviously that's not the case. "
"Now, let's imagine that the TPM is on the motherboard: the user tries the PIN, the phone is unlocked because the private key still exists, everyone's happy. Then the user updates the iPhone, Apple decide to check the TouchID sensor, kaboom. They could just require a wipe and never allow the TouchID module to be used. But they don't.The passcodes actually aren't at all kept on the TouchID sensor.  Those are kept on the TPM, which is a seperate chip soldered to the motherboard, not a replaceable part.  Maybe you should educate yourself.  In fact, it's the TPM that's saying I don't trust the TouchID sensor.  Better shut everything else down too.  Which is blatantly anti-consumer.Oh hey I took intro to IT too. What does a sensor have to with private keys?https://www.quora.com/What-is-Apple%E2%80%99s-new-Secure-Enclave-and-why-is-it-importantWhy does the phone boot then? Although the private key is not stored in the touchID sensor. Thats where the majority of complaints arise. I have no problems with Error 53 if it wasn't retroactive and you could disable it in settings.It's not 2FA though, you can use the TouchID ***or*** a password to unlock the device. "
"If TouchID hardware is detected to be invalid for whatever reason, bricking the whole device is a bad way for a consumer device to react to it when TouchID itself could just display an error and require the password to be entered.> you can use the TouchID or a password to unlock the device. "

"I read through both your links"
">Security Enclave / TrustZone"
"It's an encryption method and protocol for where things get run, basically a sandbox mode like most modern antiviruses have but run natively on the hardware and applied to all processes that the device runs. Data authentication through internet connections (both wifi and cellular) utilize auth tokens. "
"The only thing it says about TouchID in depth is that a password is created as a backup. This link says nothing useful about how TouchID interacts with the hardware on the phone such that disabling or removing TouchID would prevent access to the phone entirely and doesn't seem to support your view at all."
">TPM"
"This is the actual hardware module that performs the encrypt/decrypt functions at a hardware level (which is more secure and faster than doing it at the kernel or software level). Many manufacturers have these chips installed, and it doesn't appear this exact problem occurs with anyone except Apple."
"Okay, so why is this only a problem for Apple?"
"More importantly, if Apple integrated a TPM into the TouchID hardware in some way, why doesn't this invalidate the user accessing the device until they do a factory reset or update the device? Why can you only use the password to unlock the device under certain circumstances (reboot, 48 hours without unlock, full battery drain)?"
"From all the information out about how TouchID work it appears that users getting bricked for using 3rd party repairs isn't intentional, especially since Apple didn't release a warning about 3rd party repairs potentially bricking the device (which they don't really have a legal right to do anyway, they can only revoke the OS license since the device itself is owned by the end user). That would put Apple at fault for all the data lost and the phones that were rendered useless because of it.Allowing 3rd parties to modify a device into a usable state is a security risk."
"No defense/security contracts will sign on to Apple if they do that. Yes, They needs those pennies. Their repair department is their bloodline, they need to protect it ! "
"/sYou mean it could fallback to always asking for the pin/password to unlock?You use the product the way Apple chooses, or you don't buy it. This has been true for a very long time now.I'm pretty sure that error protects Apple's profit margin too.I would not be so sure about that.

"So many people don't even *know* there are other smartphones out there besides maybe the Galaxy.  "
"If there is one thing Apple does better than create solid hardware, it's marketing.You ***seriously*** over-estimate apple users. The dude who wrote one of the first articles literally just said that he *instantly* bought another iPhone to replace his bricked one. cool thing about apple is they have an army of drones that grows daily, who dont care."
"dont forget to buy your new iphone 6s and then 7, 7s, and 7 gs!Thats part of what I meant: If you do that to a customer, it does not matter how loyal the customer was. Yeah... right Considering who most of Apple's userbase is, that will not be the case...Just about every Apple fan I know has had a horrible experience with one of their products and went out and bought the new one to escape from it.Guess they have a working business model thenIt's basically brand identity, but unironically yeah. I don't think Apple fans are idiots or anything, but when you cater to a group of relative technology neophytes with the promise that they're buying an item that's hip and not overcomplicated like they perceive other tech to be, they're more invested in continuing with your products than Android users, who might go back and forth between manufacturers based on their experience.I think the argument usually is I don't want to switch to Android, because I'll have to relearn everything. and I agree with that, I guess. People like our parents don't have the interest to figure out the inner workings of their devices.Holy shit. This is the most accurate way to describe apples success that I've seenThen for the rest of time, your texts are screwed because of ImessageIf you message stuff that needs archiving, iMessage is the wrong tool anyway... don't you think?"
"I use SMS on my personal Android (and backup those to my gmail account), and email on my company-provided iPhone....What? That had nothing to do with Apple's Imessage issues."
"Edit: I see what you're referring to now, never mind. Pretty sure that issue was fixed. Yeah well, obviously the data has to be decrypted before you make search queries. iMessage might be bad for archiving texts but I fail to see how the cause is encryption. Are you some kind of weird troll? I'm talking about the issues with apple phones not being able to text people who have switched away from Apple because of Apple's Imessage system.What, like how you can't send Skype messages to people without Skype, or WhatsApp messages to people without WhatsApp. I don't see how not being able to send iMessages to people without iPhones is at all wrong."
"Anyway, you can do that, it's just called *texting*. I edited after I realized what you were vaguely referring to. Pretty sure that's not really an issue anymore. Obviously if you leave your phone number set up to be intercepted and other iPhones don't update your contact to always send as text message, your texts will be intercepted. Why do people insist on making shit up? There's plenty to criticise Apple for without having to lie."
"iMessage [can be very easily turned off even if you no longer physically have the phone](https://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage).That implies sacrificing not just the phone, but all the money the user has put into iTunes and the app store along with it.migrated out my entire itunes collection, and to be honest like 20 or so quid over the course of 3 and a bit years is not really a sacrifice to lose. "
"So happy to be shot of that iphone.I have a 6s plus with 128 GB of storage.  If they bricked it, it would be a $949 fuck you.  I find it hard to find an Android phone above $649, even  looking at comparable hardware.  Looks like I'd have a spare $300 to replace apps etc.  Our music collection has largely been built from Amazon (MP3s) so...  why do we still have Apple phones? "
"Oh yeah, they're pretty. And they haven't screwed us... yet.Wait, bricking one phone and being forced to buy another is *saving* you money?Well, no, because it's still $649 more than they would have spent otherwise Super easy instructions exist to give you step by step hand holding on porting your shit over to another platform. If your apps can be tied to your FB or some other social platform, you can sometimes keep your scores and stats, but everything else from itunes to icloud and contacts/txts can be saved.>thumbprint"
"A print is a username, not a password.So, what the people who are defending this are saying, is that TouchID has had a massive security flaw this whole time and that (up until now) it's been easy for a third party to change the home button and access all of the private information supposedly protected by TouchID."
"And Apple told no-one? Why isn't this a huge scandal?I want to make a comparison to another device where this was an issue with not long ago. I just made this comparison in another thread but it needs to be made here as well. "
"Also I am not defending Apple nor Google, simply just stating a case and the facts here and why Apples defense actually make sense. "
"The case was back when Google Wallet and NFC was new on Android devices there was a similar security measure which was implemented that causes Apples Error 53. In the case of Google Wallet, there was a sector of RAM on the NFC module which stored a key of sorts which was tied to your Android ID (a hash unique to each installation of Android). "
"Now this is not a problem with OTA updates or anything as the Android ID is carried over through updates. However in order to protect your Wallet data should anyone ever copy your Android system files, they would not be able to access your Wallet because they need the key attached to the NFC module. "
"Now here's the problem. If you are like many and root your Android device. Then install a new version of Android. You have now changed your Android ID. However the security key for your old Wallet is still stored in the NFC. The NFC driver would recognize the mismatch and would fail to start resulting in any app which uses secure NFC crashing. This issue bricks the NFC chip. Once the mismatch occures you cannot fix it without replacement of the device or the ability to recover your old Android ID through a Nandroid backup (system image basically). "
"I ran into this issue after flashing a Galaxy Note 2 back to stock after having issues with a Nexus ROM. I didn't clear my Google Wallet and therefore all apps which used secure NFC stopped functioning. "
"Apple has attempted the same level of hardware security here. Where a string is attached to your touch ID sensor. This string is paired with the device. This way the data on the phone is hardware protected and a malicious touch ID sensor cannot be used to bypass the OS security.A Secure Element compromise would just brick the NFC module of the Android device. Anything that doesn't require NFC would function properly."
"Error 53 renders an iPhone completely useless.But that is actually reasonable coming from Google, ya know? It bricks one component of the phone, that honestly isn't even used that much. However, with Apple, it renders your whole device useless and wipes EVERYTHING ever held on it, with no chance of recovery. I think there is quite a difference here...Remember that picture you took of your mom a few days ago? You know, when you saw her for the first time in years and days before she passed? I hope so, because there it goes."
"ie: buy our proprietary button or dont use your phone at allYes. Let's collect this sweet button dollars!!!This should be the link title. I wonder when people will start realizing Apple could just brick the authentication function instead of ruining the device.At some point you have to say thanks for the heads up, I acknowledge the risks associated with this, and carry on using your phone. "
"A simple device modified by third parties on the startup screen would also keep customers security! Disabling the phone permanently is not okay. "
"Just like some android devices allow you to unlock your boot loader, after signing off on a disclaimer and disclosure that this may damage your device and weaken security, you can proceed if you're willing to take that chance, and give up manufacturer support. "
"After all, you own the physical device, the software that the manufacturer includes may not be yours. You ought to be free to put your own on there, on your own risk of course. "
"Or, how about you give me the device free of charge, on your terms and conditions, and I don't pay for the hardware, and you can disable the device whenever you want? That would also be agreeable. "
"Reason # bajillion to jailbreak. This is really a double-edged sword. We understand Apple is trying their best to protect their users from being spied by government-backed agencies (because they will always have ideas to bypass or modify the fingerprint sensor home button). But straight up bricking it isn't the best way to solve the issue, instead it'll just make us to think you're just another greedy company that charge us ridiculous amount of repair fee and dealing with those geniuses. How about just disabling all touch-ID-related functions instead??You really think a government would be looking to exploit hardware directly for spying purposes? Nah, they'd just use a software exploit, and there is a thriving market for 0day vulnerabilities that governments buy from on the regular. Or they could attack the cell tower/communication infrastructure the iPhone is using, or any number of other attack vectors that aren't as difficult or intrusive as a physical attack."
"This is just Apple trying to save face after a design fuckup, they aren't actually concerned someone is going to pull off state of the art hardware-based attacks on individual consumer phones. What happens if you replace the TPM on Android devices that have Android Pay?It's not a bug, it's a feature...this is why i got a nice htc one m9If they are going to insist on digging that hole any deeper, they are going to need a backhoe.I'm about to attempt to fix a friend's iPhone 5S. It's just a screen replacement. Do I need to be worried about this Error 53 yet, or has it not fully rolled out yet? Or is it just for home button replacements? the screen and the home button is one in the view of this issueI hit you because I love you. It's for your own good, baby.Then have a message that says this iPhone detected a hardware change, enter your password to continueApple: You'll shoot your eye out, kid.Again: if it *really* were about safety then just disable the functions that rely on Touch ID (which was already being done). Or, another acceptable alternative: wipe the device THEN operate as if it was an iDevice without Touch ID in the first place. Though the latter might suck for some, you still have a functioning device instead of a paperweight at the end of the day.Personally after all this stuff, I will be very unlikely to invest in an Apple product in future. I'd like to get a new touch to replace the one I have (which is broken, docking port issue even after having it repaired by a certified technician), to get the data off it, but by and large there are now just too many issues to having an i-device and I'm not too ashamed to admit that I simply can't afford all these problems that occur every time the software is updated, etc. And there's too much at stake when you've got all your data on there and paid for tons of apps."
"TL;DR ordinary people can't afford all thisCan someone explain to me why touch ID gets disabled after a reboot on *everything*? Like I sort of understand why it has to be disabled for the first login. But why, after I've already entered my password, does it have to be disabled for itunes, etc.?Yes no shit. You guys are idiots if you think apple is the one who fucked up hereIs it weird that I'm still totally cool with my iPhone 4?I'm not sure I understand this. If the phone is capable of verifying the integrity of all of its internal components for the purpose of ensuring the device is secure, why is it designed to boot up and run unhindered without doing an integrity check for so long (until the next update)?"
"Yeah I feel secure now with my bricked iPhone 6."
"If the hardware was swapped then it should disable all Touch ID features rather than brick the phone. "
"I have a PS500 paperweight This just doesn't make any sense to me, in order to replace the fingerprint scanner you would need a large amount of time with the phone, this isn't something you can just steal the phone away for a bit, put it back, and then have the scans uploaded somewhere."
"To me this seems like an attempt to capitalize on an excuse, brick the phone resulting in people being unable to fix them when they break (planned obsolescence) and doing it under the guise of security. "
"Only scenario I can think of is if someone stole it, but how would putting in a fake scanner work if you don't have the original print? The phone is going to compare the readout from your finger to what it has locally, I doubt you can program something and just say let me in that is horrible security."
"The whole bricking as a result of an update is just an unintended error I think. I can't imagine this being a beneficial move overall by bricking it, it's best to require a fallback pin and email authorization secondary authorization when the fingerprint scan fails. Can someone help me with a question I have? "
"I got my Iphone 6 unlocked from one company to completely unlocked and was wondering if this update will brick my phone? I just wanted to make sure before updating despite not changing my home screen button. "
"Thanks in advanceThis issue ONLY affects iPhones that have had the home button (touch ID) sensor replaced, or the entire front (including that button) replaced.Haha apple sucks The posts here remind me of a very long argument I got into years ago over Apple charging for firmware updates for the iPod touch (using some accounting BS as the excuse). I argued against it but was stormed by blind Apple fanboys arguing it was justified. It is insane how far a fanboy will go to excuse blatant missteps (and even abuse) by the brands they worship."
"There is absolutely no reason that these phones should have to be bricked. Simply disabling Touch ID is all that should have happened to a modified phone.[There was a legit reason for the iPod upgrade charge](http://www.macworld.com/article/1131991/ipodtouch.html).  "
"And congratulations with being so familiar with all of the iPhone's security implementation in order to logically conclude that There is absolutely no reason that these phones should have to be bricked. It's obvious that Apple want's the sweet nectar of the huge home button repair market.Nobody, and I mean NOBODY, charges for such updates to these kind of consumer devices. Apple even backed off of it when a stink was raised. If it just HAD to be done, explain to me how no one else had to follow that rule."
"Also, they were supposedly free to set the amount of the charge. If their arm were truly twisted on the matter, why not charge a buck or less, instead of $20?Nobody else updates these consumer devices. All I'm saying is, before you grab the pitchfork, and assume that Apple, like all capitalist pigs, enjoy finding nefarious ways to drink your blood, think if there is another reason why a company, with arguably the best customer support and satisfaction, does something that inconveniences its users...Are you living in an Apple bubble? These kinds of devices get updated all the time. I have received numerous updates on my Android phone since purchasing it. Same for most other consumer electronic devices I own. Most consumer electronic devices receive some level of software/firmware support after the sale.By these kinds I mean MP3 players. All other upgrades from Apple (including the latest OSs) are free. The reason this particular upgrade wasn't free is because it was listed as device without subscription and for some reason you can't add features to these devices without charge. Note the add features part. The upgrade added a lot of stuff from the iPhone to the iPod that's why it was considered a feature-adding update. Security updates for example were free.The question you're failing to ask yourself is What makes an MP3 player different than a phone???, especially considering an iPod touch was basically just an iPhone without the phone internals. I've owned TONS of consumer devices (MP3 players included) that offered free software/firmware updates. On the other hand, I've owned exactly 0 that charged for those things. That is because, up until the point that Apple tried to get greedy, NOBODY charged for those things and NOBODY, not even Apple, has since. This only stopped because enough people voiced their opinion on the matter. Left up to the fanboys, we would be getting charged for everything.[Read on](http://www.revenuerecognition.com/industry/software)"
"???, and..."
"Android devices (as one example) provide MAJOR updates quite regularly, all without the need to charge. WHAT MADE APPLE DIFFERENT? Even they gave up on trying to charge for these updates after the crap hit the fan.You didn't Read on. Android phones, like iPhones, are registered as devices that adhere to the subscription based business model, and state that they will be enhanced from time to time for free. The iPod didn't adhere to this model initially. Now it does.Judging by your word choice, I'm sure you were nothing but civil when voicing your concerns. Definitely. Although, I surely can't say the same of many of those that were arguing against me.If a Personal Computer (PC) software tried to charge for updates I would switch to something else extremely fast assuming there was an alternate software.Windows aren't freeUpdating to Windows 10 was. I did have to purchase a Windows 7 key though. If they charged for Windows Updates that would be more like what I was referring to."
"Edit - added more thoughts.Yeah, Microsoft changed their business model in respect to Windows quite a bit with the new release. It's clever and for the modern world. But that's not the point. Software in general isn't free. And this particular software wasn't free for an accounting reason...Charging for these kind of updates is more akin to charging for firmware updates, bios updates and drivers than software updates on a full-fledged computer. NOBODY does that. That computer will operate without Windows. Take iOS off of your iPhone and see how far you get. Name one other similar consumer device that charges for updates.There aren't many similar consumer products that get updated regularly...Cell phones (Android, Windows and otherwise), Tablets (Android and otherwise), Game Systems (Xbox, PlayStation, whatever systems Nintendo has now), Blu-ray players, etc..., just to name a few. Most consumer electronic devices offer some level of software/firmware support after the sale.While I agree with you, Charging for firmware updates on such a consumer device is more akin to charging for BIOS updates and drivers. NOBODY does that. Could you imagine being nickled and dimed every time you needed to update anything? What Apple tried to do was set a slippery slope where even something as simple as support after the sale was no longer free.I guess I should have said drivers or important software because that was what I was thinking of. Like imagine if Nvidia charged for major driver updates. Or if my SSD refused to let me diagnosis it in less I paid to I update the software or firmware.This could also be about Apple protecting their security.If this were actually done to protect the owner's security, it would brick or freeze immediately upon replacement of the touch-id sensor. You could imagine someone replacing with a hacked sensor to gain access to the device against the owner's wishes."
"Since the reaction is delayed until the next software update, belies Apple's claims and makes this look more like vendor lock-in.I have a bridge to sell. fraudulent parts = big scary word for we don't make money on this parts"
"> Apple says iPhone 'Error 53' is to protect customers' security"
"Translation: This is for your own good. --> bit dated, as far as abuser excuses go, no?"
"This post shouldn't be tagged [Security], it should be tagged [Politics]. Nothing to do with user security. It's about securing Apple's control *from* the user. You don't own an iDevice, Apple owns you.Thank God. I thought it was because they are greedy motherfu EURers...security of their profits.I rooted, unlocked the boot loader and installed Cyanogenmod on an old Android device. It shows me a big warning message about this when I turn the device on. Is there some particular reason Apple can't do this too, rather than turning the thing into a paperweight?"
"BTW: A big thank you goes out to the developers of CM 12.1. I'm getting regular updates on a device from 2012! When it was running the manufacturer OS, it never got a single update. To think... I was gonna chuck this thing. You are much appreciated, guys.Well, it is about security. That's the point. However, this is a big fuck you to countries without Apple stores or support from Apple. A good compromise would be to just not allow touch id or apple pay, rolling back to the PIN code and deleting all card data on the phone. This is an outright scam and is Apple pushing the envelope of testing just how stupid and uninformed it's user base is.Easy solution: Don't use Apple. "
"Hell its almost as overtly malicious of a company as Google or Facebook.*It's a design feature.*This just in: General Motors destroys cars with non-original brakes"
"It was the only safe thing to do said a company spokesman. Who knows how safe that car was?Your analogy misses out when you consider that most car keys are now factory chipped. You can no longer replace a broken car key of a top brand car with a key from the hardware store.  It's a security feature.Another reason not to by an Apple phone..It's like buying something you do not own.You do realize you don't own the software component of anything you've bought with software since software began right?"
"This literally goes back to rolls of punched tape in the 1950s. Nothing new. Licensing software isn't some new phenomenon. > You do realize you don't own the software component of anything you've bought with software since software began right?"
"No, that is completely false. I own every piece of software I ever bought. I don't own IP to that piece of software. But i don't own IP over my car, I just own the car.You do realize that there have been supreme court cases that state while you may not own the software on the phone, the manufacture must in good faith provide software to make the hardware functional?"
"Essentially if you bought a device that requires certain software to work then they cannot revoke all software rights without compensating you.Fixing a broken screen has nothing to do with their software.This is like john deere not allowing a farmer to fix his own tractor that he bought.It is about maximizing profit and future profit on the device.> Fixing a broken screen has nothing to do with their software"
"And there is not one single person that has a bricked phone due to replacing their screens."
"You just made that shit up."
"> This is like john deere not allowing a farmer to fix his own tractor that he bought."
"No.  It's like John Deere telling you if you don't use OEM parts, you take matters at your own risk and void the warranty.There are car manufactures that do that. Also, speaking of farmers there are thousands of farmers who don't own their own seeds.  They are licensed. That is why Monsanto gets hate, not GMO.> This is like john deere not allowing a farmer to fix his own tractor that he bought."
"You don't realise you're saying this ironically, because this is exactly what's going on these days.  I don't think that war is over, but currently the manufacturers are winning.I realise...I still don't like it.Except this isn't about the screen. It's about the Touch ID sensor and the cryptographic hash it stores inside that is used in decrypting the storage on the phone not matching after a replacement, which you would know if you read deeper into this than muh ownership rights!!!!1!1!11!!."
"These phones aren't working because a hash that is integral to decrypting the storage device is incorrect.  This is working as designed. "
"If anything the only design flaw it that the iPhone's crypto heart is in a place vulnerable to damage. But like a nutsack, it has to be there for other reasons.It's not even really the heart of the cryptographic features, it's just one of the pieces and all the pieces have to work for the whole to function. So its like the crypto nutsack.I doubt they store cryptographic hashes in the TouchID sensor. It's simply equivalent to a model number. If it doesn't match the expected model number in stored the board, it Error 53s."
"The number is not used for actually decrypting the data. It's not a hash.>This is working as designed."
"I don't think anybody is disputing that. The problem is that the design is bad. Disable the fingerprint sign-in, sure. If Apple wants to convince us that bricking the whole phone is necessary in this situation, they're going to need to give a pretty clear argument why.They didn't intentionally brick the phones!  The phones no longer function because the Touch ID sensor is trying to use an incorrect hash, meaning the security of the device as a whole has been compromised. All the secure components of the phone have a hash that they use to communicate with each other and things don't work when that hash is incorrect. Then the design is bad. If the hash is incorrect, that component's input should be rejected. Bricking the entire phone in this case is at best, lazy.At this point it should be obvious that they did intentionally brick the phones on purpose. Before they were always willing to accept a PIN if the Touch ID sensor couldn't be confirmed. Now they suddenly decided they don't accept a PIN code anymore when the Touch ID sensor doesn't work and the phone just shouldn't start. It's obviously an intentional brick.There's a difference between an incorrect read attempt and the whole chip not having a matching hash or serial number. If the TouchID component was part of a 2 factor authentication required to access the device there might be an argument there - but it's not. You can use a password in place of TouchID to access your phone at any time instead."
"That means that TouchID being integral to accessing the device is not adding additional security when it gets involved in encrypting/decrypting the drive, and bricking the device after a 3rd party replacement serves Apple and not the consumer.Apple's customer support is so good for the most part.  Since Apple Stores opened over 10 years ago, I've gone to them about a dozen times with issues small and large (I've had iMacs, Mac Minis, iPods, IPhones, iPads, Routers, and more)... and they've been really great about just giving me a new device (sometimes upgraded from what I had) if that would be easiest.  I'm sure they don't want to be doing that if people broke it going to someone else."
"Also... with this specific case, it sounds like a thief would be able to replace the Touch ID and gain access to the phone somehow.  And that's why the error shows up.Sorry not buying it, in this particular case yes it could be argued that it's for customers security"
"However, ever install an after market battery from ifixit or similar ? Your phone will work Perfectly, until you update then you'll get error 29"
"Or use a 3rd party cable ? (Because the one supplied is crazy short) the phone throws an error for that too"
"The good customer experience is only tolerable so far, Apple are taking this shit to really petty extremes"
"It's **my** phone I should be able to repair it how I please "
"Ah...the good old It's a function not a bug excuse.Damn people are going to the paint defending this ridiculous level of security. I mean I got important things like credit card info on my phone as well but I don't put a padlock with a self destruct mechanism on my wallet that has my actual cardsYour wallet maker doesn't have security standards set forth by the financial industry that they have to adhere to.Apple weren't forced to do this by the financial industry either, as they also aren't part of the finance industry.? the cards themselves do.If you lose your wallet you just call and get new cards. If someone steals your fingerprint because of a compromised scanner are you going to call and get new hands?Stockholm Syndrome game in this thread is strong.People of Reddit, please hand me all your bitches, money and weed. It is for your own safety.You have to ask yourself: What **should** the phone do?"
"What **should** the phone do when it detects tampering of the phone by an attacker? "
"Ideally it will shut down in order to prevent the leak of any additional information that may have already been compromised."
"It should have considered TouchID void, stop."
"TouchID must be used with a pin, right?"
"Then say TouchID could be compromised, please insert the pin"
"Three tries and then total wipe."
"But this would not allow apple to sell overpriced replacements.They still should have warned users. Arrogant.To play devil's advocate here, one of Apple's main selling points when they released the Finger print ID was security. Separate chip, speicalized software, third-parties only have access to weather or not the scan was successful not the sensor itself. By implementing this error system it means that if someone were to repair a phone and replacing it with a new one it means there is no risk of that new one being fake and say sending the information to a third-party. Even making it where its difficult to change at an Apple store means an employee can't try pulling a stunt. Locking out a phone like this means they're covering their asses from any potential lawsuits about information being stolen.Why do people still buy Apple with all the problems they have? The answer to those problems is simple. do not buy Apple.Just stop buying Apple.That is a nasty little surprise for anyone to find out, and Apple monopolizing the iPhone repair business. iPhones are electronic devices, let people fix their devices at a fair rate.No! Not when it comes to Encryption, and the storage of YOUR bio-metric data!"
"With this level of security you are just going to have to let go of the whole It's my phone, and I'll do what I want with it mentality."
"Because anything that directly interfaces with Banks, Credit card companies, and the like is more assuredly NOT your device to do with, as you please.Apple's iOS development team must be headed by a total fucking idiot."
"Oh wait."
"r/thanksjonyive"
"This sounds so much like You're holding it wrong.... and our profits.Looking forward to the Apple Car!  Every single part down to the tires must be an officially authorized Apple component or the car breaks down in the middle of the road for your protection.Thumbprint access security is actually pretty important to a lot of people. I don't get what all these people are mad about. When you buy Apple, you are locked into their system. I'm surprised these people didn't already know this.Yeah, there is a fairly significant difference between the protected, walled garden of apps and bricking a device over getting the phone repaired locally.I thought this would have been on /r/nottheonionMaybe people should quit being so careless with their 700-1000 dollar devices that contain irreplaceable data. Just saying. They mean the security of their income.Just add this to list of reasons if why I fucking hate apple and will never use any of their products again>This security measure is necessary to protect your device and prevent a fraudulent Touch ID sensor from being used."
"Translation: too many repair shops taking away from money we rightfully are owed. Nobody seems to realize the potential for fake replacement chips that build in malware. It's improbable, but possible.  If someone wanted to steal a whole lot of identities, dirty replacement parts are a great point of entry.  Apple is taking a heavy handed but understandable approach.  It's not unreasonable, but it is overboard.Hey - Hey Apple."
"Try not breaking shit when you update your OS.As a long time Android owner,  I must say I'm happy I've avoided this catastrophe.   I completely understand and sometimes have to weigh the decision to void my warranty by having an unofficial fix for a device,  or pay the extra money for an official one.  But this decision is not about warranty at all.  It is a giant company like Apple FORCING people to only use their official repair service. This bullying and underhanded policy is,  I believe, going to end up having Apple backtrack this decision quickly and/or have Apple in one hell of a lawsuit.  It would be one thing if this was explained and agreed to before-hand.  It's another to pull a stunt like this afterward and hurt the millions of loyal fanboys without a care, all to dominate the market.  Just sickening.  To anyone that is going through this. ..you have my sympathy. Yup - that makes sense - however it would make MORE SENSE to TELL EVERYONE ABOUT IT BEFORE WHEN YOU BUY THE PHONE>Logic indicates that it is *time* to switch to AndroidKill the patient to cure the malady.. that's the Apple way!!!Yes, to protect security in the same way that patching jailbreaks protects security."
"They're not wanting to protect your security, they're wanting to prevent you from modding the phone in ways they don't agree with.Patching jailbreak exploits does protect security.  The same exploits you can use to gain complete control over your phone could also be used by others, in conjunction with a lesser exploit or social engineering attack, with severe consequences.  Similarly, the security feature here protects you from a real attack where someone installs a fraudulent replacement for the fingerprint sensor.  Similarly, auto manufacturers aren't *completely* lying when they say it's safer to spend multiple times the price for name brand car parts."
"The lesson here is a different one: if you make it too difficult to accomplish what your customers want while maintaining security, then your customers will do insecure things.  It is then dishonest to refuse to acknowledge responsibility for the resulting mess.I have an easy fix! only involves 2 steps. 1. Throw the iPhone out the window into a ditch because they suck 2. Get an Android :DThat's okay, I like knowing my device will receive updates consistently and not get dropped like a hot rock in a year. The only thing Apple is protecting is profit margin. "
"Yes, and it is. It would pose an *enormous* security risk if someone could just swap out the button to unlock the phone. Apple is basically the only manufacturer that gives a shit about security nowadays, and all reddit wants to do is bitch. You broke your phone. Instead of getting it fixed through apple, you took it to a cell phone repair place, voided the warranty, and bricked your phone. It's *your* fault. What they're doing is entirely reasonable. Fingerprints are very insecure anyway, it doesn't matter if you try to build a fort when you leave the front door unlockedEspecially so on a touchscreen device. Your phone is literally covered in your fingerprints.Or, paint copies of the key all over the outside of the fort.> and bricked your phone"
"You didn't brick your phone. The phone was bricked when Apple told you to upgrade your OS, and the OS decided to brick your phone that was working fine before."
"If Apple instead said Your phone is no longer compatible with iOS9, so instead of bricking it, we'll disallow upgrading the OS, that would be reasonable."
"To say You got your phone fixed 2 years ago while you were on a work assignment far from any authorized Apple repair shops, and just now we're noticing that, so we're going to brick your phone  but not tell you why, that's clearly a different situation."
"How long are Apple phones in warranty anyway? Why do I care if I void the one year warranty three years after I buy the phone?Then just disable Touch ID and have the user input a password. problem solved.Even a simple warning prior to the update that alerts users that their phone may cease to function if it has had any repairs from an unauthorized source. That way people could forgo the update. "
"But hey, the person above you is right, it is absolutely the user's fault that Apple decided to make an update that would brick a device with no warning./s"
"Of course there is still the issue of some phones being bricked that never received replacement parts, but rather just experienced some minor damage from a drop while still remaining fully functional. "
"I suppose Apple bricking a fully functional device without prior notice is somehow the user's fault, too. Stupid pleebs deserve a bricked device for not cradling their phone like a baby/sDoes this happen with Apple Authorized repair shops? Or are they not allowed to replace TouchID sensors? Aside from the cost, I can't think of a good reason to take an iPhone to an un-authoroized 3rd party repair person.convenience? My parents have someone in their town that claims to repair apple products while the nearest apple store is about 50 miles away.Do they have an authorized 3rd party repair place near them? Or just un-authorized ones? It's all moot if the authorized shops aren't allowed to replace them, but if they are then I would imagine there is an authorized place near them and that is where they should go.I work at a large company that all of sudden is going to start offering iphone screen repair to our customers.  Our current business model has nothing to do with phones at all so it's sort of a weird thing to get into.  "
"I brought this up yesterday to two of the project managers and emailed them the article from the guardian.  One of them forwarded it on, but not sure how serious they took it.  If we end up bricking even one customers phone by offering this service, it's going to be a shitstorm.  I had this problem with a used iPhone 6 I bought.  Seller never disclosed the screen had been replaced by a third party.  Touch ID wouldn't work so I sent it in to Apple since the phone was still under warranty.  Apple sent it back with the warranty voided and now with the error 53.  I fought with them for a couple of weeks, having the phone shipped back to Apple a couple of times, before they gave me a refurb.  Well, your data is certainly safe....I get that it's a security concern which is fine, but they went about this in a terrible way. They should have implemented off the factory line on all iPhones with touch id and it should be bricked immediately after the repair so you can at least get the repairman to buy you a new phone and you would have (if you are smart) backed up your phone before the repair. Pushing out an update that bricks phones is a terrible way to go about this.Yea, there are ways to do this without being an asshole.  Like maybe just release a warning: listen guys before you let someone other than us fix your phone, just know we will disable it if you do.So I bought a refurbished iPhone off eBay from a very highly rated power seller"
"But who knows, maybe my home button was replaced?  I know better then to wait at least a month before any Apple updates as they routinely butcher something but if this doesn't change it looks like I won't be updating my phone any time soon. "
"1. test you finger print sensor in Settings -> Touch ID"
"- if it works you will be fine and not get an error 53 situation."
"- if it says failed it means your finger print sensor if faulty.  (for whatever reason, it's not repairs it could be damage or a fault)."
"NOW to avoid bricking your phone you simply need to disable the touch sensor function and you will be fine.  It is as simple as that. Louis Ross [made a good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMbE8Uaiq3w) ,he's a phone repair guy, i mean,the approach apple took could be wrong but there are reasons behind it.Hey customers you're doing it wrong so we bricked your phone without warning"
"Things like this just bug me because for the most part people don't care, not really. I can't see this having any real lasting affect on Apple at all. Peoples rights being withered away slowly, day by day and people have just come to accept it. What other option do we have as consumers? They don't play fair and grow larger and larger whilst we have to suck it up and be grateful. Doesn't just go for Apple but for the majority of big corporations. Dragged into a cycle of throwing money at them in order to stay up with the Jones' or because we simply have no other option.Just disable Touch ID and make them type their password. Fucking simple. As much as I love apple products, I am starting to want their entire company policy to crash and burn the entire company. i use the touchid sensor to sign into my banking app among other things... i dont know if it is lazy engineering but i'm thankful for the lazy security?Is it only related to the touch sensor or other parts, too?This is how you accelerate your decline in market share. People talk, people learn and people change their purchasing habits.  Louis has a new video onto this topic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMbE8Uaiq3w This thread is so full of analogies. I love it. Whole 'Prometheus' movie.This is why I rarely update. And yet there will still be 3 mile long queues when the next iPhone is released...That makes perfect sense. With third party repairs, hardware n' shit it's safer to completely kill the phone than risk letting a user fuck up their life by trusting something shadyHow prevalent is this? I've read multiple threads on this topic and there are a lot of people upset at Apple for doing this but I've yet to see one person in the threads say they have the error and share the circumstances. Would be curious to hear! Tim Cook: Execute order, 66...You should be able to opt out....You Opt out, by not phone any phone that has bio-fucking-metrics in it!At least it isn't Error 66. Honest question; if this is illegal why is Tesla allowed to do the same thing with their cars?Yeah, some third party software could brick your phone, or people could be recording your conversations and selling them to advertisers, or looking at all of your personal information... Thanks for being the one to do that to us, Apple. At least it's a name we trust! Round of applause for Apple and how they always put their customers first by giving them errors. Splendid job there guys. I think part of this comes from Apple being 'the' only approved hardware source and countless 'fix yo iphone' companies sourcing their low cost replacement parts from alternative and sometimes straight up sketchy manufacturers."
"Not long ago I used a really reputable online source to replace a broken screen for my iPad..  The glass I received ended up being slightly warped and not at the level of quality I expected given the price I paid..   "
"I'm confident that the glass I got was either rejected OEM that found its way into the market or it was a Chinese knock-off.. Either way it clearly did not come from official Apple manufacturers and I was not happy with the quality."
"From this shit experience and the overall inconsistent responsiveness I now get using that new glass, I will never use or recommend anyone use anything less than official Apple repair shops to fix their devices.I've had my iPhone 5s since they came out. I've never needed any repairs(I also haven't dropped the phone but a handful of times from 2 feet). If Apple truly has their customer's best interests in mind, they would add some sort of functionality to the OS where you can disable that 'error 53' function by inputting your password.so here is my story. "
"touch id stopped working in december. I couldn't be bothered to have it fixed so I just turned it of. "
"PHONE HAS NEVER BEEN TO ANY REPAIR SHOP. 3RD PARTY OR NOT. "
"and now it's bricked. "
"how in the hell is that fair?TiL that Apple's profits improve customer security. If it was to protect customer's security, the problem would have occured immediately after the replacement was made, not months afterwards.ITT: People with no understanding of how hardware and encryption works grabbing their pitchforks.In other words it bricks it per NSA contract. Any third party repairs could void or disable the tracking on it. Once it's recognized it seizes up. I always deNSA my stuff at my local repair shopLOL sure."
"and lenovo's built in malware was for security too."
"fuck off, apple.  by security you mean we want people to pay $1000 for repairs at the GENIUS BAR.$1,000,000 for repair at the APPLE STORE>security feature"
"Well I can see where they're coming from...."
">applied retroactively through software update"
"Yeah, this is just apple being dickheads again, isn't it?"
"Golly, what a bad company."
"If only there were other phones on the market I could buy!It's simple really. The sanctity of the fingerprint scanner has to be maintained under all circumstances. I think it's the right move to brick the phone if the sensor has been tempered with.Or just roll back to using PIN-only (or just a swipe if the user chooses)? If Touch ID was the only authentication option then hard bricking would make a bit more sense. The truth is, it isn't the only authentication method available on iOS.I could see if swapping the fingerprint scanner forces you to do a factory wipe of the phone's contents like unlocking an Android phone's bootloader, but by no circumstances should it permanently brick the phone and make it unrepairable and unusable from that point on.Apple hates democracy.As an Apple phone user, as much as I hate this, I have to say this is a necessary evil. With Apple Pay you don't want third party repairers tampering with that. It's a shame it's with all phone generations though. Sounds like it's a win win position for Apple too since they can collect all revenue for repairs while backing it with a decent excuse. Instead of bricking the phone, just have it disable TouchID and apple pay.That's... Actually, now I want to know, why can't they do that?They want to stop 3rd party and diy repairs so they can make more money.Mmm hmm, I'm calling shenanigans. Well they aren't lying but they could go about it In a better way.It's a feature.Who on earth would believe the it's for your safety line?  Its pretty clear they just want the monopoly to fix their (very fragile) devices.These issues could be mitigated if apple wasn't infatuated with the hardware home button and went with a capacitive home button. Obviously the hardware home button is flawed with the amount it needs to be replaced.Ya'll know that fingerprints aren't even a little bit private, right? That a decent DSLR can pick em up from across a room? That you leave them all over hotels and offices and restaurants? "
"Apple's fingerprint scanner is security for people who read the paper newspaper and want to spend money to make the nervous feeling go away.If I had anything to protect (i.e. If I were a wealthy businessman with nude photos of my many mistresses) I'm sure I'd appreciate what Apple is doing.  However, as a random guy who is lower middle class (and can afford an iPhone, but just barely) that kind of security is more annoying than anything else.  So android is for me, but I see what Apple is trying to do and I have no problem with it.In fairness, that is, in fact, a huge security risk. The iPhone has its fingerprint system completely isolated from the main system. It doesn't matter how much you 'hack into' it, it's separated by hardware, you cannot get a user's fingerprint from the main system. Introduce non-standard hardware that could be doing...who knows what, and you break down the security.Is requiring apple to verify that the fingerprint sensor was not tampered with secure? Sure. "
"Is it a security flaw that will affect more than .01% of Apple customers? Fuck. No."
"Did Apple make this decision because of security? Fuck No!"
"No, they did it to make people give them those sweet $$$ for the home button repairs. It's a multibillion dollar industry that they can't do without.That is exactly what I was getting at.While voiding the warrenty is reasonable, there is no reason for Apple to effectively sabotage your phone following a 3rd party (or DIY) repair. The consumers drop a lot of money on these products and they should have the right to manage their property however they want to. "
"Seriously, fuck Apple.At some point people should stop to buy apple products.We stop to buy Apple products constantly!Defective by design.As if I needed more reason to never own a single apple product. I've started to go off Apple. Really... this kind of thing, and also how usually their products seem to have or develop a critical flaw that they don't always fix (bending iPhone 6, iPhone 4 antenna problems, magsafe adapters that need to be replaced every year). Magnussen-Mossy for electronics when?  All this is is a thinly veiled monopoly on parts and service.  Which since the phones are sold most of the time through carriers, is a guaranteed money maker.   This cuts out the cottage industry of repair.  They make more money when people have to come in for service.It's Apple..are you really ..really really that surprised? I don't own an apple product but why do they have the right to do this to consumers after they've already purchased the item. It's pretty ridiculous that if I owned a phone I couldn't put an aftermarket part onto it to ensure it continues functioning after their original parts fail.I refuse to use anything Apple... they're so anti-customer it isn't even remotely funny. The Error 53 is all about the money.Perhaps Apple should have told people before they needed their phone fixed, like on their website before purchase?Apple does care about security but not so much in relation to the consumer end on this issue.  This is all about money relating with security primarily with APPLE PAY.  They need secure verification and most likely required by the contracts they signed with the credit card companies associated with it.  Security for consumers is a secondary thought.  I'm sure ANDROID PAY will be the same soon.  Assume that jailbreaking and modding related issues will be mitigated as a major focus in the apple's and google's future of security for consumers as the inclusion of secured transactions aka APPLE PAY and ANDROID PAY will require apple and android to make their systems more secure.> Apple does care about security but not on the consumer end."
"You're right, of course. The phone can't be encrypted, TouchID doesn't exist and the PIN is still restricted to four digits. lemme rephrase to fulfill your misinterpretation of my statement.  Apple cares about security but NOT AS MUCH as the BUSINESS END due to contractual agreements.  And this is specifically for this latest touch ID related scenario is what i'm commenting on.  Apple does care about consumer security but this event is not related as much about that.Apparently Apple subscribes to the 'Dead phones tell no tales' school of security. I can see that for people who hold a security clearance (and not using their personal phone, mind you), but there seems to be very little bathwater thrown out with this particular baby.Hey here's a crazy idea there are competition in the phone market so since Apple is shit both price and hardware. Except for the brand of course you could stop buying their stuff since they treat you as customers bad. Why do they do this? Because they can since people will just complain and continue buying their shit.You guys know that the government is installing chips and back doors into devices... So why the outrage over Apple protecting customers?Apple makes unrepairable devices and punishes anybody who tries to repair them"
"Fuck that shit!Uh except the part about maintenance...and my post was about defining what anti competition is, not about your first argument, which is something you're still not understanding.  You're defending a company that delivers a broken product, that requires you to only send it back to them to repair, preventing any other party from the ability to repair it.  That's the argument here, and it falls under anticompetition because it isnt faulty equipment, its then programming that decides to wipe your data if the device is tampered with...say at a third party repair store.  Thats anticompetitive.  Its preventing a maintenance, even by the owner, to open the device and solve the problem by replacing a part.  It forces you to stay under a warranty or shell out for a repair from Apple directly.  "
"That would be like buying a car, owning it for 10 years, and when the battery dies you have to ship the car back to the dealership, rather than being able to replace the battery yourself or having Autozone do it.  Another reason not to buy an iPhone. I'm good with that.Its like Pa used to say:"
"Don't buy a BMW if you cant afford the maintenance costs. "
"When you buy a $800 phone, why would you take it to the chop shop?Not all 3rd party repairs are evil. Sometimes the actual dealerships are worse when it comes to repairs and over chargesSo if I understand this correctly it bricks the phone if you get it repaired by someone who doesn't know to move the touch sensor to the new screen? Sounds like people should use an authorized repair service then. The fight should be against the repair people. They are the ones that didn't repair the phone correctly. If you take your car somewhere and after leaving your engine blows up because they didn't repair it correctly you don't go after the car manufacturer. Maybe I'm missing something but with apples products it seems if you don't have them fix it this kind of stuff can happen. Glad I have an android phone.It doesn't brick the device right after the repair -- the phone works fine without Touch ID. It's when you try to do the next iOS update that the phone is bricked.  So you paid the guy at the mall kiosk his $50 or whatever and you are happy. But you're left with an Apple-designed time bomb.  Next time you update (or factory reset) your phone, it'll become a brick."
"If it bricked right away, third parties would not keep offering to replace home buttons, because they would never be able to complete a repair successfully. Instead, people keep doing this repair because they do not associate the action (repair) with the consequence (intentional bricking by Apple).  "
"This undermines their argument that it's for customer security.  They let customers use the potentially insecure hardware for whatever amount of time between the repair and the upgrade. That is usually a months-long period. Then they should make it check the sensor on every boot. If you have the money to buy apple products you shouldn't cheap out when it comes time to repair it. And everyone should back up their data somewhere besides icloud. Yes, doing it on boot is completely rational and obvious. I am really surprised they don't check until a restore or update. You dont understand correctly."
"Someone has a phone but it breaks. They go to Apple to get it fixed but Apple want $260 for the repair, they then go to a normal phone shop who want $50 or $100 for the same job. They replace the faulty sensor and the phone works fine for a few months."
"Apple push updated software, detects non OEM sensor, bricks phone with no warning. "
"People angry. Understandably. They then claim it is about security but there is no evidence that any security has been compromised and they failed to warn users their equipment will be broken.I understand that people are angry and I do think it should have bricked it immediately saying the touch id was not the original. If it's a non apple approved repair shop though it voids your warranty. I don't even use apple products because of how ridiculous their costs for everything are. I still think people should back up their data because if you lose your phone from it bricking or even theft the data on it is your responsibility.Its not about data. Its about $1000 worth of hardware basically now held for ransom."
"Voiding the warranty is only relevant if you take it to Apple and claim the failure is their fault, which would not be the case if you dropped it on the floor."
"Imagine filling your car up at the local supermarket petrol station and then paying but on returning to your car you find all the doors locked. The car would still run. Maybe the petrol has a different ethanol percentage than the Shell stuff that your car's manufacturer recommended. Only, they did recommend but last night they upgraded your cars firmware and now you can ONLY put Shell fuels in it."
"You did take your possessions with you when you paid, right? Your dog? No? Well that's your fault you idiot.  "
"You could try smashing the window but you paid extra for this model because of the security features like unbreakable glass.>but there is no evidence that any security has been compromised"
"If the touch ID sensor has been replaced, and you use it to authenticate, then security *has* been compromised. They're right about that."
"But there's just no reason to brick the phone. Just reject the input from the sensor.They are implying that there is potential for some man-in-the-middle attack or somesuch if you have a third party print scanner."
"I am asking if anything like this has happened or if it actually can, not some technicalityThe scenario they're protecting against isn't a MITM attack or any situation where you are still in possession of your phone. The attack, as I understand it, is that someone else has your phone, and they use a hacked sensor to break into it without knowing your password.I got downvoted talking about how much more I like my iPhone than my galaxy. Reddits hate for Apple is ridiculous haha. Unless it was in a thread about comparing the iphone to the Galaxy your comment was out of place and nobody gives a shit, that's why you got downvoted.There are people who buy Apple products and still want to making hardware/software changes/fixes without Apple trying to stop them. LOLSo, basically any time an iPhone breaks, Apple's response will be uh, it's supposed to do that. this whole thing just makes me laugh "
"I was an Apple fanboy up until 5 years ago when I had to replace my iphone 6 times inside a year "
"I had a macbook ipad and phone but when my phone softwear kept getting corrupted and i had to replace it I just said screw it and switched everything and have never had reason to regret itFunny I had the same thing happen to me with an Android phone and went to apple and have never looked back.Why do people still buy iPhones? You know what would work better than bricking the phone? Disabling Touch ID and forcing users to login with a password.I want this to bite Apple in the arse. I really do.As always, people are making a big deal out of a small thing...this only affects the Touch ID sensor and cable. As long as you swap over those items when getting your screen replaced, there is nothing to worry about.    "
"Why this outrage is especially stupid is because Apple charges pretty good rates for repairs, often times slightly cheaper than third party shops. But again, if you don't wanna have Apple fix your phone, just make sure to preserve those parts.I call bullshit. Nice try Apple. Except that this isn't to protect customers, it's to fleece people out of even more money.  Apple can get fucked. Explain how it's not to protect customers.  Go.... This is confusing to me - it is well known that third-party modifications on any Apple device void the warranty. It is also known that if Apple discovers third-party modifications on your phone, they refuse service. "
"If you're too lazy to take the iPhone to an ASP to have the home button replaced (it literally costs $79 OOW) then frankly you should know that if anything goes wrong with the phone in the future, then you're on your own."
"Source: Am Apple Service Tech.This isn't something going wrong with your phone - this is Apple completely disabling the phone because it detects a non-Apple part. That's like GM not letting you start your car because you didn't bring it into the dealership to have your brake pads changed. Sure, you won't get a warranty on the home button and can't get it fixed by Apple, but how is it acceptable for a company to restrict a user of a device they paid close to a thousand dollars for to use their part and service techs for repair when there are replacements that you can install yourself for less than a quarter of the cost or take to a repair shop for less than half. I do agree that it is over the top, however Apple is known for doing things like this - why is this such a surprise?"
"Most of the time, if your device is within warranty, even for an OOW repair you can get warranty coverage by calling Applecare and getting a CS code. I've had customers get phones which had been completely destroyed (water damage, run over by car, thrown against wall) get replaced at no cost just from calling Applecare and kicking up a stink."
"If you've spent $1000 on a phone, surely you'd want to keep the warranty get it serviced properly, yeah? $79 isn't much to pay for peace of mind and guaranteed service.Hey guys! I'm Apple and I'm helping you out.  You know that third party hardware you used to fix your phone 9 months ago?  Well, it turns out it could have been used to HACK YOUR SHIT!"
"So, nine months ago when you replaced your home button, I neglected to check for unofficial hardware *at boot*.  Instead, *I let you use your potentially hacked phone for 9 months*, entering your PIN, sexting, recording your location constantly, typing in your SSN to your car insurance app.  You know, that kind of private stuff you do all the time that you want to keep private. "
"But then I got around to checking for EVIL HACKING HARDWARE I found some!!! So now your phone is a brick, to protect you.  After all, if someone added EVIL HACKING HARDWARE to your phone, you should know about it *eventually*. "
"But it's your fault. You should've known not to trust the guy who said he could fix your phone, and who made your phone work again, minus Touch ID, until you made the completely straightforward decision to update your apparently working phone. "
"With Love,"
"Your best buddies at Apple who totally care about your security and can't think of a better way to check more frequently for unauthorized hardware related to encryption. "
"Disclaimer: I use an iPhone and I really wish they would fix this. It's fucking stupid and it's transparent. I'm absolutely not defending apple in any way, but something stood out to me about your first couple sentences. "
"> So, nine months ago when you replaced your home button, I neglected to check for unofficial hardware *at boot*."
"The thing is, I've had a Droid Turbo for over a year now, and I had to fix the screen on it after I dropped it. I didn't even turn the phone off. I simply put it to sleep, replaced the screen, and that was that. Never rebooted or anything. So even if they checked *at boot* it's still possible to replace parts without rebooting. And I've used my phone without issues for 3 months now without rebooting.That's a good point. Poll hourly? Ever time touch ID is used? The point is to get the consequence (bricked phone) closer to the cause (third party repair)"
"If your phone is bricked as soon as you turn it on after the swap, you immediately deal with it. Nine months or a year later, the guy at the mall kiosk is gone. You might not even remember the repair. But what if I broken my Touch ID?this is why you use ios 7 or 8 and just keep it like that with a jail break and that's it no problems everA lot of people had their App Store accounts compromised (un/pw stolen) because jail breaking bypasses all security. iPhone user agreement and software license, sections 7.3 through 8, can be translated as so what? You accepted these terms and conditions by using iOS, so....I BUY Apple devices. They LEND ME the OS. It has always been clear to me. you dont actually own your iphone . no really , go check , its in the terms and conditions that apple owns itsure, now your apple device is a nice brick!"
"good job!Even if you are borrowing the OS, Apple should not be able to destroy my hardware. I have payed for the phone and the intentional destruction of my property is unjustified. > one Guardian reader comments: I think they made an after-the-fact adjustment to a poorly conceived and implemented security system on the iPhone. They hadn't properly considered the implications of third parties substituting parts on the phones, whether these were bonafide alterations or not."
"I think that's giving Apple too much credit.  Everything the company does is designed to create a captive market.  iOS, the itunes store, the lightning cables, everything is you can only use apple and pay whatever we decide to charge you.  "
"Why would anybody give them the benefit of the doubt when claim to have a good reason for doing it again?  They're a corporation.  They exist to make money.  That's what they're doing and they know they're doing.It's like when you buy a apple product you dont own it but apple still owns your device I bought a house and decided to cut the foundation because it says so in the Holy Book. The house fell. It's like I didn't own the house at all!I don't understand why you can't dismantle it and get the SD card out, plug it into a PC and retrieve your data."
"If this is hard to do, someone should make a kit that takes the flash memory and lets you plug it into an SD card slot or USB slot."
"Maybe someone can explain what I'm missing (since I use Android).You are missing basic knowledge and understanding of how these devices work.yes, but the data is stored somewhere in the phone. Why don't people just take it apart and get at it?  There are a lot of ingenious hackers and electronic technicians out there.The simplest answer is because they are encrypted. The passcode you enter to unlock your phone isn't just a protection of the user interface. It's hard coded encryption system that renders your data unreadable if you don't have it. The whole encryption war that is now once again debated is for this reason. If a government agency or anyone else could simply take the memory out of your phone and read it somewhere else, what's the point of a passcode?initiate protocol 66"
"TIL apple is run by a modern day sith lord.With the grand plan of taking all those button repairs moneys.Do we really want people to be able to tinker with Touch ID? Anyone who knows anything about Encryption, Bio-metrics, and security will firmly tell you NO!This is premo security.... No one can access the device the device is pretty secure....Because it fucking is"
"Apple takes its eye off the ball: Why Apple fans are really coming to hate Apple softwareI'm 52 and I think I'm doing fairly well keeping up with consumer tech. But whenever I try to do something useful on iTunes on my laptop, I wonder for a minute if perhaps I don't actually know how to use computers, or maybe I did know how to but have recently had the knowledge of those skills removed by a brain aneurysm that I've forgotten about. "
"I usually just give up and go have some toast and soft-boiled eggs. "
"Just turned 25 and every time I use Itunes I think I've finally hit the age where I'm losing touch with technology. I don't think anyone can use iTunes effectively."
"As someone who's been around computers for my whole life, iTunes is the worst I've ever had to deal with. Thankfully I moved onwards to android and I'll never have to use iTunes again.Ive worked supporting iTunes to certain customers and had problems explaining its erratic behaviors. So yeah..iTunes is probably #3 most frustrating thing in technology, behind printing (#2), and using any computer owned by someone who insists on installing everything that pops up in their web browser (#1).My 55-year-old dad uses iTunes to archive all the rips of his 1000+ CDs, since he has an iPod."
"But he actually *catalogues* them using Excel, of all things. So basically, Windows Excel is a better music sorting program than iTunes.To be fair, excel can do almost anything.Same here. I'm 45, been using computers for decades, building websites for the past ten years, provide tech support to everyone I know, teach courses in computing and web design at the community college level, but I'll be fucked if I can get a goddam movie from my daughter's iPod to my iMac without having an existential crisis.Hahaha! Man, that cracked me up. It seems so odd to me that you can't drag and drop files to an iPhone that's connected to a computer. And it makes me glad to own an Android device.That was the first thing that absolutely blew my mind about Apple devices. You can't just drop files on the device, *everything* has to go through itunes."
"Always had an Android smartphone, but my work gave us all Apple phones to use at work. I constantly found myself saying how is anybody ok with this? when discovering all the things the device *can't* do."
"I couldn't jailbreak the phone because it wasn't mine, but I think a lot of my problems would have been solved by that."
"."
"Haha, ya know, just the words they use for jailbreak vs rooting characterize the difference."
"An Android user can be given root access, they call it what it is - superuser access to the root directory. But over on the Apple side, they call it jailbreak because you're usually confined and denied basic freedom.I just posted a very similar story. I'm in a band as an Android user with three iPhone users. We need to pass recordings to each other frequently and through Dropbox."
"It seems like nearly every technical issue is because of something iPhone simply can't do, and usually related to them being completely unable to access their files through any sort of explorer. That is an absolutely insane limitation to me."
"When I tried to troubleshoot these problems on their phones I, too, kept saying How is anybody OK with this? They basically babyproofed their OS. That's great if you're critically tech illiterate, but for anyone who regularly uses a PC or Mac without it bursting into flames, it's such overkill.I'm only 35 and I've used computers my entire life (since I was 10 or 11).  It's my hobby and my career.  "
"Still no fucking clue how to use iTunes.  Every time I start it up, it's a crap shoot whether it see any of the new apps/music, ask for some kind of weird authorization, pair my device to that computer for all eternity?  If I sync it, it always seems to remove shit from the apple product (maybe if it doesn't exist on the computer, I don't really know)."
"I just want to manage my music.  Even fucking drag and drop would be nice.  I don't want to worry about my entire apple ecosystem to add a new song.Oh yeah, the fucking synching.  Jesus.  I don't want to completely erase one library and replace it with another.  I don't even want to have to worry that that will happen.  I JUST WANT TO MOVE A FUCKING FILE.  Preach it!  I completely fucked up my whole itunes account by synching incorrectly.  It took all the energy and dark forces I could muster to fix it.  A month later I bought a Samsung note.  Now have an S6.  The end.Sync is scary.Straight up. I work at a computer store and I couldn't begin to tell you the amount of times where a customer comes in and they've lost all their important documents and media due to syncing fuckups.Transferring files and Apple simply do not fit in the same room. Take any other computer, phone or a tablet, and you can just plug it in and transfer files. Any file. Any folder. Anywhere. Apple is totally allergic to anything related to transferring files. Childish restrictions like this annoy me...It took me a long time to realize that my iPhone-using friends had no access to their actual files through any sort of generic file explorer. I wanted one friend to put an audio recording in our shared Dropbox folder..."
"Several ways to accomplish on Android, zero to accomplish on iPhone. I kept telling him to just find the audio file itself and he genuinely didn't know what I meant outside of viewing it in the audio recorder."
"It still blows my mind. I never thought I'd be grateful just because Android let's me directly access my own files."
"EDIT: before anyone else explains how easy it is now, the ability to share to Dropbox was only added since this story took place (about a year or so ago). At the time, you could text the files (which converted them to unusably shitty .amr files) or email them. If you wanted them on Dropbox, you had to email them to someone without such ridiculous limitations.This is why I'll never use an iOS device. That is way too locked down.Yet i have extremely tech-savvy friends who like to customize and tweak the shit out every thing they get their hands on, yet at the same time  swear by their iPhone. I never understood that.Yeah the idea that people do not understand folder hierarchy and things like file types / associations in 2016 is mind boggling."
"We have taken a huge step back from stuff I thought would be mandatory by now."
"Though perhaps I am getting out of touch because the idea of syncing pictures offsite bugs me. Deleting local copy or deleting both copies... knowing which pictures are actually on my phone... it gets frustrating and o long for the days where I occasionally plugged in and backed shit up.Preview isn't great. But its problems are peanuts next to iTunes, iMovie, Mail or such."
"I'd love to be able to delete some of the Apple apps off my iPhone. Why the hell did Apple make Podcasts a built-in now? Because it was so bad they didn't think people would use it any other way?Create a folder. Put all the garbage applications into the folder. Name the folder with the poop emoji."
"It's not the same as deleting the apps, but it feels good.I feel like that's part of the modern age of computing. You have a managed device that you have very limited control over. apple has allowed very limited control since the iphone 1Mine's called iJunk.The good ol' crapple folderMine is called UnwantediShit for meI wouldn't call myself an Apple fan, though I do own several of their products. I can safely say that iTunes is one of the worst pieces of software I have ever had the misfortune of using. That and it seems every iOS update makes my devices slower, that is when it isn't bricking them. There was a time when I loved iTunes. Back when all it did was music and podcasts. Those days are a long long time ago.Really? Because I honestly cannot recall a time when iTunes *didn't* suck. I mean, seriously, I remember using it about ten years ago and it sucked. And every year in-between. The only goddamn reason I have it is because the iphone requires having it when you want to put your mp3s on the damn thing.It was pretty good until about 2007.I think it might just be an age thing. I didn't use my computer for much more than listening to music and trolling around 4chan. I think the most intensive thing I did was watch flash videos on newgrounds since youtube didn't exist yet. Any short comings of iTunes were unnoticeable to me. Now I have chrome tabs for days, skype, spotify, photoshop cs6, and a bunch of other background processes that I'm sure would make it more noticeable. The experience between using iTunes on Windows and iTunes on a Mac are very different. Probably done on purpose, too. Is the interface the same? Because that a lot of the suckage. "
"And the music player on the iPhone has been getting worse and worse. Thankfully they added back a shuffle all button, but you cant go to the rest of the album from a shuffled song now... Interface is the same, but the Windows version is known to be much buggier and crashes much more often. Yeah iTunes on mac is not bad.  On Windows it's worse than McAfeeMcAfee should treat it as a virus...I had an iPhone 3G back when they were new and iTunes was such a disaster that I refused to touch an apple product for over 7 years."
"Here's the story. I was married back in 2008 and my wife and I both got 3G's. We only had one computer in the house between us both, and at the time you had to plug your phone into a computer and use iTunes to upgrade it. I never had any desire to use iTunes, but Apple forced me to."
"The time to upgrade the operating system on the phones came about at the same time my marriage was ending. My wife wasn't very tech savvy, so I told her I would upgrade her phone for her. I plugged her phone in and started the update process. It took over 2 hours to complete the process, which is absolutely insane. It should have taken a couple of minutes to transfer a file over to the phone and maybe 10-15 to upgrade it, but no Apple made this process a complete pain in the ass."
"After finishing with her phone I started on my phone. It took even longer than hers and it also completely gutted my phone. It removed all my apps and pictures and replaced them with hers. It removed about half of my contacts and added about half of her contacts to my phone. I have no fucking idea why Apple decided it was a good idea to shuffle around everything on your phone while you are just trying to do an upgrade. There was absolutely no warning that my apps and contacts would be modified in any way. I was horrified and there was no way to undo the damage."
"I spent days trying to get all my contacts and apps back to where they were. The pictures were gone and there was no way I could find to recover them. I refused to let iTunes touch my phone again out of pure anxiety and fear that it would destroy everything again."
"Then it happened. My wife had moved out and we had just started the process to file for divorce. This is the point at which I went to my phone and clicked on the contact labelled 'Dad'. I was in complete shock and horror when the person on the end of the line was not my dad at all. It was my soon to be ex-father-in-law who began cursing me out in a tirade that took me months to recover from."
"iTunes was a disaster back in 2008. I don't know how it is now and I will never know how it is now because for the rest of my life I will never touch that program again. The user experience was the absolutely furthest thing from anything even slightly resembling user-friendly."
"I switched to Android as fast as I could and the OTA updates were a breath of fresh air. It took me until 2015 to touch an Apple product again, and that was a mac book air that I used for backpacking around the world. The touch-pad integration is amazing, but the apps themselves aren't all that easy to use and some of them suffer from issues that make them almost completely unusable (I'm looking at you photos app)."
"tl;dr: iTunes traumatized me for life.Pretty much sums up why I've always been an Android user. Had a 3GS that my sister gave me as a hand me down and it lasted about 5-6 months before I gave it the flick. I shouldn't be forced to wipe my phone if I'm connecting it to someone else PC or doing a simple upgrade. Reading that reminds me about back when I was into Apple products. I don't have any specific horror stories like yours, but I definitely remember the horrifying feeling of having no way to know if iTunes would remove all my data or not.My wife decided to get iphone 5 (had iphone 4s something)..."
"I am very tech savy (working it) or so I believed. Plug iphone 4s : backup ALL. write down the date. Try to restore on 4s: date is good. Ok lets do it. "
"Plug iphone 5: yes new phone. Yes with restore from today's backup. Yay this is easy. WRONG !!!"
"Nothing restored... Wtf? Weird. Ok I'll plug back the old one... NO this is NOT a new phone. Sync in progress HUH ? STOP WTF ?? I am scared now..."
"Long story short : lost 3/4 of contacts and half of 100's pictures. My wife's contacts are 8th world marvel: with pictures and almost all data fields filled. I somehow fucked up ... O m g fml."
"When you plug a new phone you better, beforehand, find the backup storage in your files somewhere  \user\appdata AND copy it elsewhere BECAUSE IT WILL BE REPLACED (WTF??) BY NOTHING with the first AUTOsync 2 seconds when you plug your new phone. W T F ??? /facepalm"
"She now owns Galaxy 5s rooted and everything. I just got myself lg 4G. "
"Fuck itunes. Fuck apple."
"ITunes was so bad 8 YEARS ago that I haven't bought an apple product since the 2nd Gen iPod Touch. I can't imagine how irritated I'd be if I'd had to use iTunes all these years.Is there software that can do the same thing while also working with my iPod classic? Tons of managers can work with the Ipod classic.  Although I believe that was the cutoff when they started encrypting the file system, so you need to download Itunes and extract a couple background processes (applemobiledevice and appleapplicationsupport) and install those independently.  The only way for software to communicate with an Apple device is through Apple's processes.  The Itunes installer exe can be opened in an extraction program like 7zip to get at the individually bundled installers."
"I use Winamp to manage mine.There was a program called MediaMonkey a long time ago that was pretty good, but I have no idea what the status of that project is now. It was pretty big back in the day.I use Media Monkey. It's still going. I use it to sync music to my AndroidI listen to classical music a lot, and I relied heavily on a Genre->Artist->Album sort, where I used the composer as the artist and put the performer in the album name. I know there's a Composer metadata tag, but its support is too spotty to rely on."
"Now, when I click Classical it's just a pile of 80 albums, many of which are from box sets and are impossible to navigate without the artist breakdown."
"I use Ecoute now and it's basically just the old iOS Music app. There's another called Cesium that's made by a redditor who is using the proceeds to fund a vacation with his kids, but I hate to say that it has far too many performance issues to be usable right now. Takes a solid 20 seconds to load my album list.The sorting is a mess. "
"In iTunes I have albums sorted by artist->year, because that's how the discography makes sense. But I listen to most of my music on my Apple TV, which is hooked to my nice speakers. "
"When I share my library to it, it sorts it by artist->album alphabetically, no matter what. I've actually went and numbered the albums 01, 02, etc chronologically in the sort name thing, which works, but what bullshit that I have to do that. I'd like to know why I have to use an app designed to manage media to manage my telephone."
"It'd be nice if there was a decent app designed specifically for phone related management tasks that worked reliably."
"It's kind of like buying a Windows phone and using CD Player to take backups and install updates.Can I just add that the Music app on the iPhone is also turning to garbage? I can't sort my music the way I want to now, I can't go to the song currently playing and look at the rest of the songs on the album, and don't get me started on Apple Music."
"Why isn't Apple Music its own app? Since the iPhone was released, the Music app was for music on your phone. But Apple Music is now so tightly integrated in the music app I can't even search my own music without having to close the apple music listings first. It's ridiculous."
"Edit: Okay so apparently a lot of my complaints about the app are actually just because they've changed it so much I don't know how to use it anymore, but thanks to you guys I'm slowly learning how to use my Music app again!It's terrible! They ruined it!A-fucking-men!"
"I'm so pissed that Apple is now succumbing to giving us interrupt-ware to push their shitty software."
"It started for me with gamecenter and now it's apple music."
"I should've shorted them when the slide is usability started."
"> I can't go to the song currently playing and look at the rest of the songs on the album,"
"It took me a few months, but I finally figured it out yesterday, if you are playing a song and tap the icon with the 3 dots at the bottom right then tap the album cover that pops up and it will show the rest of the album"
"I fucking hate it, especially considering I used to know how to use the app and they purposefully made it worse"
"but at least I figured this out> It took me a few months, but I finally figured it out yesterday,"
"That's generally a sign of bad designYou guys are making Windows Media player sound attractive.yeah i wish they'd just left the music app alone. it was good enough. now if i want to play music i have to make sure to turn the internet off first or wait 30 seconds or more for it to connect to apple music. and they changed the display so i have to jump between options just to find all of my albums that used to be displayed all togetheriTunes just keeps getting worse and worse and when they killed the iPod classic I was very sad."
"Edit the classic was perfect it had a small screen so it wouldn't break, a huge capacity, and and a battery that lasted for hours. I don't want apps I want all my musicThey should Bring it back. Like mini or classic size with ssds.  Make them funky colors like always. But like 500gb+ maybe even 1tb. Which raises the question of what the hell are they doing to it? It's a 15 year old product. By now it should have perfected it's purpose: playing, purchasing and managing media on your pc and devices.>Which raises the question of what the hell are they doing to it?"
"Loading it up with so much crap to enforce DRM. There's really no reason any iDevice shouldn't be plugged into a computer and be usable like a USB Drive... but they, for some fucking reason or another, thought iTunes should manage AND enforce all that.If i remember correctly doesn't apple use some kind of weird storage method creating a fuckton of drive partitions, which would make it awkward to use in regular file managers.More like just a fuck ton of folders and files inside those based on some criteria.  Then, on top of that, each folder and file has a random shortened name.  The actual names and meta data (names, artist, id3 tags,  album art, lyrics, etc) are then stored inside a database file, that if it gets corrupted, makes all of your music disappear while still taking up storage.  "
"Its fucking absurd.  Why not just optimize for lossless and store the files in a computer readable file system? after years of organising and curating my collection, the shitness of iTunes is what pushed me to Spotify. "
"Can't go back now.And the irony of all of this is that the zune software was damn near perfection from day one, and only got better, and yet...and yet, to this day, no one trust Microsoft with anything other than the main OS, and XBOX. "
"I blame IE6.People love to shit on the zune, but it was really an amazing piece of hardware with some damn good softwareI'm still using it right now. I don't think that I will ever switch. Even have the 270 mb installer backed up for a rainy day.Same, I have it backed up I. Like 4 places just In case I lose one of them. Now if only I can add music to my zune on linux..."
"Edit: in* not I.They are trying to push that fucking Apple Music bullshit on the phone and iTunes. Nothing better than getting a goddamn full screen ad every couple of weeks when I open up the music app. There also used to be helpful categories neatly arranged for all songs, artists, genre, etc. Now there's music and three other tabs that take me to some shit where they ask for money or to connect to something and follow people. All the base menus are now buried in a labyrinth of sub-menus. The heart feature next to songs doesn't add it to a favourites playlist like every other music app or service. In fact, I still have no fucking idea what it does."
"And it's the same shit for iTunes for some reason. It used to have a sidebar menu that had everything the user wanted to interact with. It acted as homebase. One patch later, they hid it by default but still had the option to bring it back. Another patch after that, they just got rid of it altogether... sort of. The sidebar is there when in playlist mode, but vanishes in any other mode. In fact, much of the UI emerges/disappears/repositions based on what submenu you choose. It's as if they wanted to build the most unfriendly user design possible. They succeeded. It's the worst thing EVER. EVER.Like so many products, instead of doing one thing well, they began to make compromises to make it do a lot of things with mediocrity.But my bedside lamp has a clock *Built-In*!  It can receive texts and take pictures too."
"I mean sure, I can't figure out which menu the light function is in.Never half-ass two things, whole-ass one thing."
"-Ron Swanson"
"They could learn a lot from that man. I know I have.I tried turning off Apple Music, iTunes Store, iTunes ~~Match~~ Metadata-destroyer, everything I could that wasn't plain local music management. And it still manages to piss me off every time I open it. Apple Music is also very poorly organized. very poorly is an understatement. Apple Music is completely useless. I used it for 6 months and I'm going to be honest those were the worst 6 months of my life up to this point. When I cancelled Apple Music I had to completely restore my phone because it fucked everything up so bad. There are too many complaints to name them all, but the one that grinded my gears the most was the fact that for some reason, Apple changed a shit ton of my uncensored songs to the censored versions. None of my Apple Music songs got changed, only the ones I had before Apple Music. It wouldn't let me use the uncensored version from my computer so I was forced to download the same song I already had from Apple Music. I'm convinced they did this intentionally to force me only to use Apple Music songs. Fuckers "
"/endrantI'm with you on the conspiracy. iTunes used to (it doesn't seem to anymore) delete songs at random that I didn't buy on iTunes. This includes music *that I made myself* (I'm a musician). I ended up having to make special backups of songs that were hard to find because of this. So frustrating. I highly suggest Google Play Music. I once used iTunes."
"Back in -05 or so, I had a weak moment and bought an iPod. It required iTunes to get the songs on it, so I installed iTunes and pointed it to my music library. "
"This library was the result of many, many months ripping my CD's, arranging it in a carefully thought out folder structure with metadata added and edited to perfection."
"After iTunes was done with it, I was left with a flat folder structure full of useless garbled file names."
"Haven't touched a Apple device since, and won't ever.I'm a little surprised you didn't massacre the entire Apple campus.OH FUCK DONT GET ME STARTED on what itunes did to my meta tags holy shitWaaay back when I had an iPod, I had received Muse's newest album as a gift. Slapped that sucker in the CD tray, set itunes to rip. It gets confused and goes all hey, is this The Resistance by Muse or The Resistance by Muse?"
"I picked the wrong one, because all my song names from the album are in Japanese now."
"IPod went through the wash, it didn't make it. Itunes went through the control panel, it didn't make it either."
"This was the original reason I switched to Android way back in like 2009 or something. Plug the phone into the computer, copy music folders over like a USB drive, open them in my phone's Winamp app, done. This is all I've ever known. What is using iTunes all about?iTunes is about giving into your overlord and hoping that in its benevolence, it will give you that which you desire. Trying to rise up against it and manage your music manually will be dealt with swiftly and brutally.Plug iPhone/iPod into computer, does nothing. Install iTunes. iTunes recognizes iDevice, syncs playlists. Last time I used an iPod (things might have changed since), there wasn't even drag and drop through iTunes. You make playlists, and it will sync those playlists to your phone/pod. Plugging it into another computer (one without those playlists on it) will basically wipe your iPhone/iPod and sync it up with the new computer. This might leave it completely blank."
"--If anybody has more recent, relevant information, let me know.--You have to add music to itunes, then sync it to your iPhone. No way to get music from you phone to itunes or to another person's computer (without wiping your entire library/ sketchy 3rd party tools). Same for videos, except 9/10 times you have to convert it in iTunes before it syncs to your phone."
"photos is similar but a bit different."
"Having a real file manager (and now Google Fi) is what's keeping me with Android phones.I hate how it's impossible to drag a photo into another app. I always need to first drag it on the desktop, then in the app, then delete the photo. Why? Because poop.Apple in their ultimate wisdom decided that there shall be absolutely zero filesystem exposure on the iPhone.  By itself, I don't think this is neccesarily a bad design choice.  What you get instead is essentially a database of music, pictures, apps, contacts, etc.  Naturally there is a filesystem that the operating system uses (and apps each get a private directory they can use for storage as well) but none of this is presented to the user."
"When you want to transfer files from your computer to your iPhone, you need to use a program that will update the database as well as transfer your files over.  This program is iTunes.  A few years after the iPod's inception, Apple started encrypting the database in an attempt to prevent others from implementing an alternative to iTunes.  I don't know what it's like now, but this is what we end users like to call, a dick move, and it allowed Apple to be really lazy on iTunes development since they essentially were the gatekeepers between your 2000's PC with a sweet Napster/Kazaa/Bittorrent music library and their shiny portable."
"The biggest probem with iTunes (in my most humble oppinion) is the fact that you need it in the first place.  Ideally, Apple could have followed the exact same arcitecture and provided a basic API to developers on desktop platforms instead of actively trying to lock it down through security by obscurity.  Had they done this instead, you would have a choice of which program to use to sync your iPhone.  People could happily use iTunes when they want, but could also use more minimalistic software if iTunes is too much."
"Speaking of too much, when you look up software bloat in a dictionary, the picture you will see next to it is a screenshot of iTunes running on windows.  The program is like a dumpster that Apple keeps trying to shovel features into, and it's just a massive pain in the ass when it can do all these useless things, but will outright refuse to do certain things just because Apple doesn't want you to.  For instance iTunes limits your ability to make backups in certain situations.  I don't remember the exact details, but it's something like you can't mix libraries.  If you want to sync music to your phone from your brother's itunes, you need to delete all your music on your phone first.  <edit> It's my computer.  You will copy the damn file where I tell you to, or your memory is getting deallocated! </edit> "
"This is just an oppinion / review from my experiences.  I'm not trying to sell or short anything.>[I don't know what it's like now, but this is what we end users like to call, a dick move, and it allowed Apple to be really lazy on iTunes development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c-d720OvH8)"
"Reminded me of that scene in R&M."
">Ideally, Apple could have followed the exact same arcitecture and provided a basic API to developers on desktop platforms instead of actively trying to lock it down through security by obscurity."
"I think you give Apple too much credit. Locking you into iTunes was never about security, it was about control - something Jobs was famous for being obsessed with in terms of controlling the user experience."
"It was also the path to additional monetization from artists / content producers and distributors as well as placating legal entities that were concerned about piracy.Pain. Suffering. Garden variety sodomy. "
"You want to copy some shit over to your phone? Cool brah go ahead and import it to me. K. Now plug in your phone and let's do this. OMG YOUR PHONE IS SYNCD TO ANOTHER COMPUTER!!!!!! I WILL NOT SYNC ANYTHING TO IT UNLESS I DELETE EVERYTHING FROM IT FIRST, K? K????"
"Yeah. It's dumb. This is literally THE reason I never bought an Apple product in my life. Way back in like 2006 I had the displeasure of trying to use iTunes to upload music onto a gifted iPod shuffle. It was so incredibly painful, poorly automated, RAM hogging and bloody unintuitive. If managing music was such a brainsore, why the hell would I invest in that ecosystem? "
"Never looked back. To this day I get viscerally angry if I find QuickTime or Bonjour installed on my computer.Dude that's nothing. One time I plugged my phone in cause I wanted to put the audio book I purchased on it (fuck me right?)"
"ITunes decide to install every single app I had ever downloaded in my 9 years of owning an iPhone. "
"It installed like 1000 apps. And since I obviously didn't have space for that. They were just icons and didn't work. "
"I had to manually delete them. "
"It took days. "
"I'll never plug my phone in again. I'll just buy the fucking audio book twice. > I'll never plug my phone in again. I'll just buy the fucking audio book twice."
"This was the plan alllllllllll along. *evil laugh*I just don't understand how this is not a dealbreaker for most people. I'm not trying to undermine Apple, the iPhone is a great piece of tech and its role in the development of the smartphone cannot be denied, but this proprietary software is just impractical. "
"I basically use my android device like a USB, copying into it all sorts of media (music, movies, pdf docs, ppt slides, etc) for viewing directly on my phone and sometime for transferring using standard 'copy and paste' procedure. I can't imagine dealing with the iPhone's limitations. It absolutely was a deal breaker for me. 10 years ago. Using an iPod with a PC and a sizeable music collection  was a pain. Copy everything manually and then using a 3rd party program to build the internal library. "
"I really miss this about android."
"The people in r/jailbreak kept telling me : oh, it's nothing to get a tweak to do that. "
"You mean a $15 tweak that barely works? For something android has done natively since ground zero? And spend more money on tweaks to get a sub part android experience when i could just sell the iPhone to some poor idiot, and get an android? "
"Why the hell am i using an iPhone?? I miss Google keyboard. I miss folders. I miss being able to download shit directly to my sd card or my phone memory. I miss having an sd card. I miss setting up my home screen apps in shapes. /rant Also, I'm going to keep copies of every file you've ever imported. No it's not actually there but I'm showing you the file name because I thought you might like to look through the stuff you used to have mixed over with what you currently have. Don't think about it too much. Thinking will only cause you pain.I've used non-Apple phones ever since my first cellphone, and recently my workplace game me an iPhone 6 to use for work.  I seriously thought I was doing something wrong with iTunes, like I was fucking the importing/syncing up somehow since I had never used an iPhone before."
"I couldn't believe that it seriously worked like that.ITunes is becoming as much of a joke as Internet Explorer. Yeah, fuck you, if you make a simple thing like transferring legally-purchased music files from my PC library to my mobile device a tyrannical exercise in rage-inducing restrictions and limitations, then I'm jailbreaking it, pirating everything, and you can go fuck yourself. Hell, I'll even *donate* if possible to the artists I want to support and get tickets to their shows (of which many receive a much larger cut than they do for their tracks/albums) with my savings because (1) I want to anyway, but also because (2) *fuck* you.even if you jailbreak it now there is no way to access the device as a usb stick and copy the files from your pc to the phone."
"you still have to find a way to transfer them to the phones internal storage but since apple has used a unique file identifier for all imported music from itunes (read a piece of shit) this means even those .mp3 files will not show up in your music library like they would on android."
"you have to manually use a file manager tool. browse to the file location and then open it that way. its sooooooo frustrating and the main reason I sold all my apple devices and i will never buy another. I've found my peopleI'm not a big Apple person, but even just getting photos and video off my wife's Ipad is a fucking nightmare. Holy Jesus. Why is it so hard to have all the photos and videos in ONE FOLDER that you can just copy to a real PC and then delete off the Ipad... WTF. I never understood the Apple just is more intuitive thing. I never argue with those people though as they won't listen to you ever lol.I'm a pretty techy person and I just thought I was stupid not understanding Apple's system of moving files on and off my iPhone. I kept thinking.. why can't I just transfer files from/to it?? I guess I'm not the only one.It dates back to the earliest days of the iPod. The only way Steve + Apple could get the record labels to sign on was to put restrictions like this into place. Otherwise the iPod could be used to make illegal copies of music (plug into machine A, sync, plug into machine B, sync, and now machine B has new songs)"
"It's like they had never heard of the USB stick."
"I hate how they decide there's a better way to do things and take away the ability to do it the way you're used to. Like, in Preview, they took away the ability to switch to the hand tool because you can do those functions with multi-touch. Fuck you. I like using a mouse. And not that stupid magic mouse that feels like holding a fucking playing card. You can hold option-space bar to use the hand tool, but that's a bitch when I'm zoomed in on a wiring schematic and tracing wires all over the place. > but that's a bitch when I'm zoomed in on a wiring schematic and tracing wires all over the place. "
"There's your problem. You're using software to get things done. Don't you know you're just supposed to marvel in silence at that sweet cross-platform integration of the user interface? /sI remember when Steve Jobs said something like people want devices that just work. They seem to have forgotten that. The user experience is really more and more painful with every update. Instead of making software that conforms to me, they're making software that I have to conform to. They've really lost the plot.It funny because it's now easier to use a PC for many of the things it was easier to use a mac for in the pastBack in '96 I had my first Web job at a 100% Mac shop. I had never been a Mac fan but knew them inside and out. I even started to believe the standard fiction that they were more user-friendly than PCs."
"Then I tried to customize the system sounds on a brand new Windows 95 PC I had purchased. I was looking around to find out where Windows kept the system sounds thinking it must be like the Mac where, if you wanted to change your standard system beep sound you had to first find the sound on the web, convert it to a Mac-compatible file, find the system file in the system folder on your Mac, put the sound file there and then you could go into your control panel and change the sound."
"My girlfriend at the time was more used to PCs than me and she said, Just click 'Browse...' from the control panel and choose the file wherever it is."
"..."
"WAT?"
"That was ridiculously, hilariously easy compared to the Mac.>  Instead of making software that conforms to me, they're making software that I have to conform to. "
"Well, this is a very personal point of view. "
"Welcome to my position on Apple though, I've ALWAYS felt their it just works moto needed to be It just works only if you do it the way we want. I've always felt Apple required me to conform to their way of doing things, though likely a good chunk of people didn't need to change much.I've always said apple products are good for those who don't know how to use computers. But if you do, then their software  is awful. Want options for that? Sorry, no options for that. To be fair, I feel like Apple always made products that users had to conform to, to some degree."
"Android is all about customization. Apple gives few options, but (traditionally) made those few options work better and more reliably than the alternatives. That doesn't seem to be the case any longer.Steve Jobs also said plenty of things like You are holding it wrong, 7'' tablets should come with sandpaper, so users can file down their fingers, If you see a stylus or a task manager, 'they blew it', 'no one's going to buy' a big phone, and did not believe users wanted high-resolution phones or shoot video with their camera phone, or even use third party apps. He was also firmly against Blu-Ray because he said you could watch 1080p videos online."
"Apple has always wanted their users to conform to their products and not the other way around, even during Steve Jobs time.I am a long-time Unix user who happily moved from Linux to Mac OS X quite some time ago.   I have not seen the stability problems mentioned in the article, but I definitely think the usability of Mac OS X and iOS has peaked and has been getting noticeably worse over the last couple years."
"Unintuitive applications and features along with obscure UX is increasingly bad.  As someone with decades of experience and a computer science degree, I have a fighting chance to work out how to make the device do what I want.  Trying to explain it to my parents is a lost cause."
"To me, it seems like Apple has too many UX people, all tasked with making improvements.  The net effect is 'change for the sake of change'.   My parents knew how to search on their early iPhones.  Now, it's slide down on the screen and it will show a search input.  WTF?  It's not intuitive, and there are dozens of examples of more of this."
"The merging of iOS concepts into Mac apps is also a disaster.   Photos is garbage.  Change for the sake of change.  It doesn't work well as a desktop app."
"I actually dumped OS X 10.11 for Linux on my macbook because they broke one too many Unix features, and HFS+ and the scheduler are still terrible.Which Unix features did they break? I haven't run into any issues with my workflow. I've brought this up a few times, but I'm curious: as someone who clearly pays attention to UI/UX, how do you feel about hard pressing a solid piece of glass?UX person here: it's terrible but we've run out of other gestures. Hard press violates the basic concept of affordability. You have no idea if something has two press states and no idea what will happen when you do. It's basically worse than right clicking. "
"But amazing once you know it's there.Out of curiosity, what is it that makes right clicking bad?Often that you don't know if it works, there is no indicator what it will result in where and how."
"Many programs now standardise on pop-up menus showing only the currently needed things, but all features are still available through the menu bar."
"But not all software is like this, there is still software where the right click is used for menus not otherwise reachable, or for non-standard actions. You never know in advance.> Change for the sake of change."
"100%. I paid 5k for a customized 17 MacBook with exactly the features that I needed for editing movies and music but so many of those features have been discarded by updates and replaced with garbage that it's no longer the computer that I bought."
"Not to mention having to pull my motherboard and cook it in the oven because they got cheap on Chinese solder."
"And the company is completely unresponsive no matter how much you complain.F-F-F-F-Five thousand dollars????Honestly I don't know how prices like this aren't enough to turn people off Apple, let alone the other fuckery. Sounds like a job for a desktop.$5,000 macbook = $800 desktop, I'd imagine.Ditto: bought a Macbook Pro and the update to Yosemite killed my Final Cut Pro X and OnOne software. Now my 2008 Mac Pro is once again my primary workhorse computer (was able to revert from Yosemite back to Mavericks with TimeMachine) and the laptop is more of a TV. I grew to hate all Apple software updates, especially for the iPhone where it seems you ONLY get functions you don't really need or want and LOSE the things you do use. I left iPhone and went Android and love it. My old iPhone 4s is still kicking, and still asks every time I use it if I want to update to iOS 9 or whatever they're on... there is no way to permanently tell it no, and updating it would surely kill it. Seriously, if there were another alternative to PC or Apple I'd be checking it out, I'm over the whole thing; come on google, design a computer that can run a version of Adobe software!! Don't do that, there are plenty of companies out there that will reflow it affordably. As long as it isn't an underlying heat issue causing the solder joints to break (cough, HP laptops and Xbox 360), a proper reflow should hold for a long time. Quite a bit longer than throwing it in a kitchen oven.Hey send me a link. I see the guys on ebay that supposedly fix macbook mobo's but I don't know to trust them (I worry that they're just throwing it in the oven like I do lol.)"
"It is, however, an underlying heat issue. It gets up over 250deg on a regular basis with all the graphic work I do. "
"I *did* stop playing MMO's on it and that helped a little.Sounds like you need to invest in a new computer.The only new computer for me will be one I build myself. I'm done with the crap being sold to consumers today."
"Funny thing: I have a powerbook 5300ce that still works perfectly -except the battery- (6k when new) *and* I still have a top-of-the-line blue/white G3 desktop that still works perfectly (400 *solid* MHz of processing excellence!)"
"I can't remember when I bought the Powerbook but the G3 was from '99 so that gives you an idea of how low Apple's hardware standards are today. Most of my cars don't last as long as my original macs."
"Unfortunately technology/processing speed has passed these things by but I do still use them (just not for YouTube or Java.)Why would any customer, and one of Apple to boot, have to put up with treating their motherboard like a take-and-bake pizza?Why can't I group face time yet? What does Apple use internally when they need to have a video conference? "
"[deleted]Skype?It would also be nice if Apple could make a Windows client (and maybe even Android) for FaceTime. It's not nearly as useful as it could be if every device could run it. As it is, you have to remember whether the person you want to call has an Apple device or not. same with imessage but that's one of the only things keeping a lot of people I know with ios. Apparently, I'm that guy who's texts show up in blue or green or whatever.This and the facetime thing are the dumbest pro iphone arguments. Like, they're pretty solid pieces of hardware, but god dammit it's annoying that half of their social apps are locked down and incompatible with the majority of the handset market.Probably WebEx or some shit. Please wait for your conference to begin! Too Dee dooo de dooo diii ......Ding ding ding! That what we used when I worked there. It's pretty much what any large company uses.Hangouts?Fuck dude even fb messenger or skype at least work relatively platform-agnostic. "
"The worst fucking thing about facetime is my ~~friends~~ acquaintances with iphones act like they've never heard of another video chat app and like *I'm* the pain in the ass for not being able to use that proprietary locked down bullshit, rather than, you know, literally any other video chat service. "
"Skype used to be a verb ffs.Remember when Facetime was supposed to be ~~open-source~~ an open standard?Until a patent troll group sued Apple, resulting in Apple having to pay royalties. I believe that adequately explains why they haven't pushed it to other platforms.If I remember rightly, they had to re-engineer it to use relay servers instead of direct communication between peers as a result of the troll suit. Damn shame really the p2p version worked way better.It was going to be until VirnetX fucked us all over by waving their patents around."
"Since apple lost that patent battle FaceTime couldn't directly negotiate device to device, all the data gets relayed through apple.  "
"Since apple is paying the data bills for FaceTime, they no longer want to open standard it for good reason. > Since apple lost that patent battle FaceTime couldn't directly negotiate device to device, all the data gets relayed through apple. "
"Well, that sucks. For multiple reasons.Yup.  Apple is going to pay out $625 million for it. "
"http://www.engadget.com/2016/02/03/apple-to-pay-virnetx-in-lawsuit/"
"[Heres a better background on the issue and why we don't have high quality direct connections for FaceTime anymore](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/08/report-after-patent-loss-apple-tweaks-facetime-and-logs-500000-complaints/)Apple is regressing back to the days of quicktime."
"Seriously though.. remember when your brand new Windows computer was filled with shit that you didn't want? That's what the iPhone is now."
"I don't understand why things are going wrong. Apple employs over 100,000 people. They can't ALL be incompetent. What the fuck is Tim Cook doing? Anyone on reddit could point out a dozen things they don't like about Apple. So why isn't anything being fixed?The thing that went wrong, was that Steve Jobs died. And instead of helping people operate independently, he was an asshole dictator."
"Maybe he intended it to be that way, for us to see the Steve Jobs years as the good years. That only he could keep Apple innovative and working."
"Man, what a brilliant egotistical asshole.Yep, as soon as Jobs died I said well, that's the end of Apple being ground-breakingly innovative. I mean, of course they weren't going to roll over and die with the creator, but a company like Apple, needs an asshat dictator like Jobs to do what it needs to do. Keep everyone in line, on their toes, and constantly be striving for success. Jobs put his public email online, answered a lot of angry messages (sometimes with his own angry replies) and he was a CEO who cared what the fuck Apple was doing."
"I'm not saying that Tim doesn't care; of course he does. But no one can care like Steve did for his baby."
"Within another decade or so, unless there is a serious shakeup at Apple (doubtful), it will basically be Microsoft, ten years ago. A stable, bland, rich powerhouse that everyone just tolerates because hasn't it been huge forever? UghThis. Which is why I'm concerned about what's going to happen to Tesla once Elon Musk passes on. He runs his companies in a similar way. Hi, I'm a computer repair guy at a small local shop. We just fix pcs and macs, not the phones. But I have to tell you, I always cringe when I see a Macbook come in for repair, because of just how god awful the experience always is."
"With PCs, there are usually easy parts that you can point to that cause issues. Hardware problems that can be diagnosed, software problems that can be resolved."
"But with Macs, there's always a process, and it's always awful. Some examples over the past month:"
"* Man wants us to upgrade to El Capitan. Seems simple enough. He doesn't have an apple id, so we need to make one for him. AppleID requires a credit card before using on the store, even for free upgrades, there's a workaround, but it doesn't seem to be working the way online tutorials state. Finally, we ask him for a credit card, and go to great lengths to explain that it won't cost him. Go to update. Download fails. No reason. Now try to click again, no error, no message, no nothing. Click again. Nothing occurs. Tried rebooting. Same symptoms. No idea what's going on. Try logging out and logging back in with apple id. Click to download, finally it starts working. Somewhat. Eventually fails without error. No reason why. After two days of trial and error, we discover that update fails over wifi for no apparent reason. Plug in ethernet, it finally works."
"* Man needs new hard drive, we install with his version of OSX, but can't get his apps off app store because apple only provides the latest edition of apps, which require the latest version of osx, and it's not in their software library. End up pirating the damn free software."
"* Man has slowness issue. All hardware diagnostics pass. Try installing new copy of OSX, it fails without error (just stops). Try new hard drive? Now won't boot off DVD. Eventually discover it's the hard drive cable. Third one this year. (How can this be such a common issue?)"
"* Attempting to install garage band for a friend. Requires newer version of OSX, but this computer doesn't support that version of OSX. Off to pirate again because APPLE makes it so impossible."
"The list goes on and on and on. Every single time I go to do a Mac repair, I know that it's going to be an endless goose chase of solutions because the real, obvious solution will never work as intended.I don't *hate* Apple software, but a lot of it feels like late beta rather than a final release.  It's not like Steve Jobs never allowed software to be shipped that wasn't feature complete or had problems (MobileMe, anyone?), but it feels like there's a lot of it these days."
"Maybe the best way to put it is that I spend more time these days looking forward to the next OS releases to fix problems rather than to add new functionality."
">Maybe the best way to put it is that I spend more time these days looking forward to the next OS releases to fix problems rather than to add new functionality."
"And so much disappointment, since updates seem to be more focused on adding features than fixing bugs. I'm still waiting for a fix to music disappearing mid-search in Spotlight, but instead we've been blessed with the new feature of being able to find music in the iTunes Store from spotlight and Siri more easily than content on our actual phones. "
"I'm ready to give up. Someone pointed out in a recent thread here that it's now possible to transfer even text message history to Android phones when switching- Sony even bundles a desktop app to do the whole thing for you. So headphone jack or not, my iPhone 7 will probably be a Sony Xperia. Didn't Steve Jobs gather the MobileMe team in an auditorium and rip into them when he found out how many problems it had?And made a public apology during one of his presentations.He was the one keeping their standards high. His replacement doesn't share the same vision he did. He probably shares the same vision, but just doesn't tear everyone around him to shreds for screwing up like Jobs did. Once Jobs was gone, the big bad wolf wasn't around to scare Apple employees into giving 120%. Maybe?He doesn't seem to share so much of the vision though. Jobs always wanted to create the most intuitive product possible, these days Apple is shitting all over many basic UX concepts. How the hell is someone supposed to know they have to slide down on the home screen to get to spotlight? How the hell am I supposed to just magically know how to use their new weird implementation of window snap on my Mac? There's 0 discoverability in these features, something Android really is doing better these days. "
"Also Cook is giving Ive too much power, and he seems a little crazy. Their new magic mouse and the Apple Pen would have NEVER been allowed to even be considered a valid prototype under Jobs. It's a joke.I just hate it when I am happy using the software how I want to use it and they keep pushing other things on me.  Like The Cloud, Mail, some stupid Apple Music thing, etc.  I am good.  Leave me alone.Uh oh. Someone is becoming an old fogey. back in my day we had windows xp for two decades and we liked it dagnabit. :-D "
"Seriously though, I've got a 27 2009 imac that's being force antiquated by the fucking updates apple keeps shoving my way. It is strictly used for photo editing, no new software in over a year and it lags so bad all because of apples BS. [deleted]How many megabits are in a dagnabit?I have iOS 9 on my 5s. When using the Music app, I expect it to show me the music I have on the device. "
"By default the app starts with My Music... It is, sort of... a list of compilations I had purchased some time in the past. I didn't upload the list to the phone on any occasion. I never accessed it on my phone. It is not stored on my phone and with a 500MB/Mo plan I will not access it online even if I could. Worse, it is an incomplete list of what I have in iTunes. I don't want this list on my phone. The screen layout has Recently added at the top using 30% of the screen, compilations containing said list I didn't create or will ever use on my phone using 50% of the app's screen, leaving me a tiny 5% sliver listing local content in queue - that or I have to go to Playlists access my local content. All I want to see is local content. "
"So, My music really isn't mine. My Music, Radio and Connect, are 75% of the options are Apple's on line clutter interfering with music I have locally. The phone incessantly nags you to log into the cloud when using locally stored content. "
"My cell plan is over 100 bucks a month favoring phone features over data. Apple's hard-on for cloud features makes the phone increasingly tedious to use. I don't need it - piss off!>I dread opening the thing."
"That sums it up for me. I f'ing hate to open itunes anymore and I always put off updates until I absolutely *have* to download it."
"I have a busted iphone 6 screen too and after I heard about getting bricked for not using the official Apple service I'm afraid to replace it myself."
"This arrogance was the cost for Apple becoming *the* go-to for consumer tech-ware. I long for the days when everybody scoffed at my nerdy Mac. Now we're all in it together.> I long for the days when everybody scoffed at my nerdy Mac."
"If you want to be a tech-hipster, come on over to /r/chromeos. People love to make fun of our devices.I am an Apple fan. Well, decidedly a bit more so in the past. A former Apple genius in full disclosure, and a lifelong Apple nerd. I was the kid defending his Apple to my friends when we played Starcraft over 32k modems. Sure, that was about the only thing I could play. Not much coming out for Apple, back in those days. Myst, maybe? Halo, almost. Well, eventually. Damn you Xbox. Anyways."
"As the PC revolution happened, I was there on the front lines with friends with competing builds hosting LAN parties. For those I'd just generally use the house machine, but still I would often, repeatedly, to detriment declare my preference for the Mac I left at home. I championed their products in and out of the home, at school, at work, and even made a professional career out of it."
"To me, they were renown for their connectivity, their simplicity, their intuitive nature and stability. Everything was right where you wanted it. They didn't crash. You could learn it quickly, though many lacked that patience early on. The hardware was reliable."
"Windows was demonstrably flaky, every time I touched one. The shelf life of PCs always seemed to lack. Every time I sat at a PC, there was some minor misplacement or malfunction that irked me, like I wanted some contextual menu that was in the wrong place, I thought, or features hidden beneath poor organization. Frequent crashes, upsets, losses of data, to me Windows seemed haunted, honestly."
"And after all, Steves' Jobs and Woz were known for using a box that let you hack the phone system. And I understood that. I was always a little suburban saboteur and I was beginning to understand the transformative power of technology. And Apple's products worked amazingly, were stable, longer lasting, powerful, and cutting edge."
"But still, I got shit for that dedication pretty much all through my education, into college, on into my technical career in IT. I'm not saying I never used PCs or never grew to like them (I'm writing this on ubuntu,) but I just always had appreciated the facility with which Apple could just make it all work."
"However, when they switched to the intel architecture away from the motorola powerPC chipset, they did lose a bit of their stability, and their performance, and shelf life, at first."
"And when Steve Jobs died they truly lost some of their primary direction. The software is losing that impeccable touch, noticeably. In spite of the new campus being constructed about a mile East of One Infinite Loop (itself an actual infinite loop this time.)"
"It seems like now we are constantly being badgered with frequent recursive iterations of update cycles to the iPods, iPads, iPhones and Macs in our lives. They seem to slow down, get heavier, get flakier. Perhaps Tim Cook at the helm doesn't seem to engender the same level of attention to detail that Apple had prior."
"So moving along to my problem. I updated my iPhone 5 to latest iOS 9.2.1, using iTunes 10 on my Mac Mini running OS 10.6.8. Now, my iPhone makes my Mac prompt me with cannot be synced because it's software is not compatible with this version of iTunes. And I can't update the version of iTunes, because 10 is the last version for 10.6. And 10.6 is the last version for my Mac."
"My Mac willfully made it so the phone that was just paired with it can no longer read it's own iTunes library?! Awesome."
"And for some reason now iPhoto won't download the pictures and videos.  So I need to individually export the data on the phone to the cloud, before I can restore the phone. "
"I echo what these guys Michael Hiltzik and Walt Mossberg are saying.  There has been a noticeable degradation of parts of the integration within the Apple interface.All of your problems are your own doing.  If you would buy the latest models of each product like you are supposed to, there would be no issues.I'm an Android and Windows user, and I hope Apple steps up its game. After all, without competition, Android and Windows will become shit. What pisses me off the most is when there has been glitches in their programs dating back to the dawn of OS X that still linger around despite all of the versions numbers they've used. Take Mail.app for example, same problems are in the iOS and OS X versions. Noting new, you know just the same old glitch that when it asks for the account password it only saves it to the incoming settings and not the outgoing. Then it creates duplicate Keychain entries that only makes the problem worse. "
"I for one prey to Jobs that Apple keeps El Capitan around for more than a year and actually take the time to fix problems as opposed to this annual upgrade cycle we've been stuck in. It's fucking madness that every year we have to put up with the burden of a new OS that always causes more harm than good to someone's computer."
"I was helping this sweet old lady (in her 90s) who has lived Macs for ever. She had a 2008 iMac and her printer broke, so we ordered up an HP ENVY 4something that I've ordered dozens of times before. A month later her iMac dies and we order a new one. It comes with El Capitan so she's jumping from 10.8 to 10.11, that's enough of a learning curve to begin with not to mention the cost of it all. Then sure enough, the printer is incompatible with the new OS. After hours on the phone with both Apple Care and HP support, they remote in and we even did a conference call between the three of us... no solution found and the engineers are working on a solution but who knows when that will be. Well fast forward to today and even with the latest public beta 10.11.4 the fucker still won't print from OS X. Of course when we were going through this initially it was past the return policy so this poor old lady is just stuck with crap upon crap. Thanks Apple! You guys really know what's best for your customers because we really need a new desktop OS every fucking year."
"Just fucking fix the shit you have now before you move on to the next big thing. "
"Obligatory, Apple Maps still sucks for me. I'd like to pick my own default map app already please. For the past 3 years or so I've seriously considered switching over to Android [If Apple do remove the headphone jack for the iPhone 7 then I will absolutely leave for Android]. Now I'm considering switching away from my macbook pro as well."
"Edit: I've gotten some awesome [Non-Apple] phone recommendations from you guys, thanks!"
"Edit 2: Since there has been some discussion about what effect the switch would have I've decided to copy paste some of that conversation to better describe *some* of my issues with the idea of switching to the lightning connector."
"Everything I say is in response to this comment:"
"> Since my other comment was downvoted, I'd like to point out that the TRS jack dates from 1878: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)"
">It is an extremely outdated and fragile design. It relies on prongs to contact the jack. The contact area is small and the prongs are easily damaged. If anything, Apple (and everyone else) spend millions every year on warranty damage to this 19th century technology."
">There are far better jacks on the market. Some prefer XLR jacks for connecting headphones. XLR jacks are much more durable and make a far better electrical contact. This is not an opinion."
">Once Apple dumps this 1878 technology, so will everyone else."
">Watch and see. I'll bet a shiny new quarter that Samsung will manufacture phones without a TRS jack by the end of 2016."
"My Response:"
"> Yeah, Well I work as a DJ, and not one of those budget laptop DJs, (Check my history if you want some verification). This means I have plenty of experience with audio equipment and various audio cable types. The TRS is perfectly fine, as long as it's not made of cheese it will hold up to plenty. I've only ever broken one and that took enough force to break pretty much any other cable type. "
">The sound quality is a non-issue when talking about this type of audio product. Hell, I can't name a professional (Let's say $2,000 and up) Mixer that doesn't use a TRS (albeit the larger 1/4^th inch ones) Maybe if we were hooking up massive club systems but this is for iPhone headphones/earphones. In fact Pioneer's upcoming flagship mixer, the DJM 900NXS2 is coming with a 1/4 AND 1/8th inch jack. (it's going to be the industry standard and priced at $2,100) The previous generation (which I use: The DJM 900 Nexus) didn't have the 1/8^th but people wanted it so they added it! "
">Here is the Current Nexus: http://www.clearviewsound.co.uk/communities/7/004/013/087/317//images/4623154125.jpg"
">Here is the Nexus 2: http://images.tonecontrol.nl/images/productimages/Pioneer-DJM-900NXS2-voorkant-schuin.jpg"
">As for XLR which you offered as an alternative... Are you kidding me? For a consumer product...???"
">[Here is an image of an XLR next to a standard TRS for anyone who wants a reference on this](http://media.guitarcenter.com/is/image/MMGS7/3.5mm-Male-TRS-to-Dual-XLR-Male-Stereo-Breakout-Y-Cable-3-m/J02163000001000-00-500x500.jpg)"
"Can you imagine that in your phone?? Apple wants to make things thinner (at this point that's pretty dumb... but whatever) not as fat as a whale!"
">No way people are putting those on phones. Try again."
">Or did you mean RCA? Well then we are still dealing with a large plug (for anyone who wants to know this is often the cable that does audio for your TV in red and white with the prongs)."
">As for dumping this technology:"
"Apple is proposing putting the audio through their current lighting connectors which experience way more issues than the TRS jacks. (Google it, I dare you). This does NOTHING other than lock people in."
"The audio is exactly the same. 100% If you don't believe me check Linus Tech Tips on youtube who are very well respected in the technology world. They talk about it as well. "
">Edit: In fact Here: (they go off on a tangent for a bit but they get back to the topic) https://youtu.be/k_tFt_X57Ik?t=28m40s  --- They do a good job of addressing my other reasons for hating this idea."
">Edited again to add some more technical info, I love talking audio Tech.Apple wouldn't be the first company to remove the headphone port. Htc had a number of phones that had an adapter that plugged into the Usb portI forget... What's HTC's market share again?hahaha very poor but this was before they flopped There just may a cause and effect at work here.i blame focus on sense and trying too hard to be like samsungFunnily enough, I went from Samsung to HTC to Motorola in search of a non shitty ui.  Stock Android ftw.It's a shame, because HTC has some nice hardware.indeed, the incredible was my favorite Evo4g was glory days. I don't think they will ever match that level of awesomenessI made the switch. Android isn't perfect but the freedom to do what I want with my damn phone keepse from even considering another apple phone. Just install Linux or Windows on your Mac if you are thinking of switching. No need to buy a new computer.Having had an iPhone since they came out, I've been frustrated with the platform for a few years, but wasn't really impressed by other options until this year. I recently switched to an LG V10, and after a week of using it, came to realize how bad my stockholm syndrome had been - even as much as I complained about iOS/iPhones. "
"I wish I would have jumped ship sooner, but I really don't think the hardware/software combos out there were up to snuff until recently. They added features at the sacrifice of stability... but the V10 makes my iPhone seem like a relic. Nexus 6p brother. This phone is amazing Nexus 6p master race checking in.  The hype surrounding this phone was real.  Best phone I've owned by a huge margin.  I really don't feel like anything has changed. iTunes has always been shit. Sometimes I think I am the only one on the planet that has actually used it to back up my iPhone. I have always dreaded opening it. "
"Safari used to be a complete memory hog, now it's actually very good, Mail hasn't changed hardly at all in the last 5 years. Preview works well for small document sizes, if you want to open a 100 page book you want Adobe software. The one thing that pissed me off the most was the rollout of iCloud. It was there, but you couldn't use it for anything really. It only took like 4 years to give you the ability to upload a file that wasn't from your phone or a Pages/Numbers document. "
"I am still very confident in the stability of the OS overall though. Between that and seamless Time Machine backups (that work very well) I am never worried about crashes and catastrophic loss of data like I am with Windows. Switched 6 years ago and still haven't ever caught a virus :)"
"Now if both companies will stop hiding ALL MY BUTTONS with every update I will be happy."
"Longtime Mac owner with a brand new Surface Pro. Thought it was just me, guess not.The biggest issue with Apple is that people still go head over heels for the new iPhone. They don't need to change how we want, because everyone else doesn't care. The rot set in with 10.7. The move to flat interfaces and grey icons just makes obvious what was happening for quite awhile. The pretty has taken over even the functional elements."
"They've killed off virtually every pro app they have and anything vaguely serious."
"The thing is, the thing that Apple was traditionally good at - the human machine interface - is really hard. I'm not sure you could reasonably do it without the kind of complete control that Apple has. And you can't have that complete control and survive unless you have really good product."
"I can't see anyone coming along and offering a similar experience. If you look at the commercial alternative - Android and Windows - the experience is so variable."
"But then, look at the history of Apple. They've had bad periods before. Mac OS 8 and 9 weren't always great. OS X took several versions to get right."
"Maybe it is all fleeting, and we should all just be grateful for the rare periods when everything comes together.It'll get buried, but [Elementary OS](https://elementary.io/) saved my life.  I sold my 2x macs when I got comfortable with it.I had original iPods, and the 3GS. After years using Windows phones and android, I managed to miss iTunes sucking so hard. Now I have a 6s and iTunes is the hardest bit of software I have to use on my pc. I feel like I'm using source tree or GitHub just trying to sync music. It's pathetic.Photos is not a replacement for iPhoto. And stop dumbing down OS X. And can we pretty please get a decent filesystem in it!I've been a user of Apple products for quite a few years now, and things really started going downhill once Jobs passed. I was expecting this. Changes for the sake of making changes, and making 'improvements' that make absolutely no sense. Great, Apple, you make your phone .00034323423 mm thinner. Good for you... I don't give a fuck. Give me better battery life. Give me a phone that doesn't bend in my pocket. Don't give me a phone cover with a battery that that looks like it was glued to the back and when I'm using it I can't plug in a pair of headphones that YOU MAKE! Don't make the new Macbook ~~Pro~~ so damn thin that it can't properly manage the thermals of the CPU and throttles to like 50% of what it should be capable of while it's sitting there idle. Don't give me one single USB type C port and expect me to make use of it for everything from managing all my peripherals, to charging the computer. Really? Getting rid of the 3.5 mm jack just because you can? How did that work out for you with thunderbolt? What? It didn't? Pushing out half-assed bug-riddled major OS updates just so that you can keep your historical release schedule. So many things that they have been doing over the last few years has bothered me, and they are losing sight of the vision Jobs had. Repeating the mistakes of the past. The guy was an ass, to be sure, but he knew what he was doing. I have an iPhone and iPad.. I have never used any Apple apps to play  music  or video. They are awful.  iTunes is a nightmare. You can't just get an MP3 onto your phone.. The rigmarole you have to go through.. Infuriating!   I ask myself daily why I don't move to android or Windows. Then I remember the hundreds of pounds I've probably spent on games and apps to get the phone working normally. And I think.. I don't want to have wasted all my money.  And then everyone else I know has an iPhone with iMessage. Gah... I'll  break away one day..and that day will be glorious. Snow Leopard felt like the last real power user OS to me."
"Since then, it's felt like all they are doing is catering to users that come from iOS. Some of which is good, I like that I can make phone calls off my PC but... They don't need to hide features like the dashboard, which they will clearly disable. Yeah. I'm real scared of where things might be headed.The people in r/jailbreak kept telling me : oh, it's nothing to get a tweak to do that. You mean a $15 tweak that barely works? For something android has done natively since ground zero? And spend more money on tweaks to get a sub part android experience when i could just sell the iPhone to some poor idiot, and get an android?"
"Why the hell am i using an iPhone?? I miss Google keyboard. I miss folders. I miss being able to download shit directly to my sd card or my phone memory. I miss having an sd card. I miss setting up my home screen apps in shapes. For me Apple took its eye off the ball when iPhones became their big money maker and they just let apple laptops and desktops slide."
"Their operating system used to have massive improvements with every iteration but lately it seems they say with this new version of OS X we added in these other cool iPhone features!.I've always run both Mac and Windows, but Apple gets some (easily fixed) things really wrong:"
"- On iPhone, after all these years and complaints, you still can't mark a text message as unread without a jailbreak.  For heaven's sake, Blackberry can do this!!  I switched to a Blackberry from iPhone 6 for this reason alone, and it runs almost all of the same apps through Android.  And, I can use Blackberry Link to use the phone through both Mac and Windows.  With my iPhone I could only use the iMessage feature on Mac.  Microsoft is now on the rebound because they concluded that walled gardens are no longer tenable.  Apple needs to figure that out as well."
"- iOS updates that ensure obsolescence by making devices painfully slow--without warning or an option to skip without constant reminders."
"- Jony Ive is a good designer, but his devotion to form exceeds that of function. His hero, Dieter Rams, had principles for good design, one of which states: Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process show respect towards the user.  How respectful to the user is it to design an object that while beautiful, is so delicate that almost everyone will have to hide it within a protective cover to prevent it from being damaged?  I think the iPhone 6 is beautiful, but it's too expensive and delicate to risk carrying around naked."
"- iTunes has sown the seeds of its own abandonment by being too restrictive and controlling.  When they were the only game in town that worked.  Back then the prospect of migrating to another media manager was scary, and that hesitancy kept many from switching (the devil you know and all that).  But as iTunes became more bloated and unstable others were making it easier to migrate and growing their content catalogs.  "
"- In the wearables category, Fitbit, Garmin and others work with both iOS and Android.  These will ultimately win the game because they don't anchor a user to a particular phone OS."
"All of these issues can be addressed, but Apple has decided that the customer is wrong.  "
"Remember the Apple ad where the runner through the hammer into the screen?  Apple has now become the screen.  I've been using apple products pretty exclusively since about 2000, and just purchased a new iMac to replace my six year old MacBook.  I'm completely underwhelmed, and echo the sentiments that iTunes, iPhoto, and Mail get worse with each new release.  I'm seriously thinking of jumping ship.  >Adobe Acrobat, the leading third-party PDF reader, handles with ease."
"All credibility lost.  I hate iTunes as much as any other Mac user (which is to say a metric fuckton).  But as crashy as Preview may be, no user in their right mind would voluntarily open Acrobat Reader unless they absolutely, positively have to.I think that was his point.  For all of Acrobat's problems, at least it runs.Foxit Reader FTW. I haven't used Acrobat in years.Why do people hate Adobe reader?"

"I can't go a day without my MBP having to be restarted once or twice due a VPN bug that I reported first in October 2014 that was finally closed as a duplicate of someone else's report of it, but which still has not been fixed."
"I was pointing this stuff out to Apple years ago (calling executive customer relations and reporting bugs), and I knew at the time my efforts were futile. They were futile because the iPhone is a cash cow and so they assumed they were doing everything right. I remember saying that I hope it doesn't take Apple tailspinning again to get a good foundation, but the problem is that Apple can't tailspin. They could live off their cash reserves for a long, long time."
"The change happened before Steve Jobs died. So it's either not related, or his influence at Apple was waning due to his poor health before he died. Also Bertrand Serlet left Apple around the time the quality was going down. And then Scott Forstall was ousted."
"Personally, I don't have nearly as many bugs on iOS as I do on OS X. OS X has, for me, been a hot mess since 10.7. But I have weird workflows that most people don't, so a lot of what I was noticing other  people weren't.If you don't like Apple products, the solution is actually very simple. Stop giving them your money. "

"This advice, it's like the people who give this advice really believe that everyone else has overlooked this simple advice and they are here to enlighten us.  "
"Also people that don't like Apple products already don't buy them. The issue is that there are lots of people that either do like apple products, or think them the best of a bad bunch, but still have problems with individual things, which of course is perfectly legitimate. The thing is, despite articles like these, many people still really love Apple products and it shows in their sales numbers, customer satisfaction numbers, and value of the company. "
"/r/technology often just lives in a bubble. Yeah I still enjoy using my MacBook Pro over any other laptop I've used. If for nothing else, then for the trackpad. Nothing competes. Oh and the battery life is amazing for a 3 year old computer."
"Obviously Apple has its issues and bad decisions, every company does. Apple seems to get a lot more attention for all of theirs, but I guess that's a consequence of being on top."

"Take Google. Don't get me wrong I'm all in all very freaking happy with the direction Google is taking. But if we focus on Google+, killing Reader, YouTube design changes (especially on tablet), and Google Music I could write a full article on how Google is going downhill and get tons of pageviews.Has anyone bought an iPad Pro out of interest?That's an expensive interest.Intuitive design = drag and drop. Go Android."
"Shitty design = Apply clusterfuck of restrictions, DRM, and complicated processes to do things that should be as simple as 'drag and drop'iTunes was the singular reason that drove me to Android, and I'd never dare go back. I mean none of my other tech gear was Mac, so integrating with PC was far easier on Android, but iTunes was just too much to put up with. What baffles me is that things stop working for no apparent reason. I used to tell Siri remind me about taking out the garbage when I get home and when I got to my house I would get a notification from reminders. Now it won't work, I didn't change anything, I tried to fix it but I find myself saying the same thing and Siri creates the reminder but I'm never notified. There are many issues like this one that are just weird and seem to have no explanation.Everyone said that Steve Jobs was a huge micromanager, and that once he left the company would begin to lose its way, because he never really let anyone but him learn how to truly lead their various divisions of the company."
"Little by little, that is very clearly happening. Apple's guiding force used to be a very clear You pay out the ass for it, but what you get is the best, and over the last 3-4 years I think we've all watched that erode/blur as the leaders Jobs left behind struggle to find their own vision.Couldn't agree more with the article. The new Music app on iPhone is total shit. And for the love of god let me uninstall apps I don't use!I'd just like to say that I'm really happy I'm not the only one who thinks that Apple has consistently lowered their standards and constantly ignored the pleas from their customers to get their shit together. Sounds like everyone here has had enough, and it's refreshing to see everyone being so honest."
"The one thing I'd like to add to all the other shortcomings of Apple is their absolute reluctance to issue any press statements for any of their numerous fuckups. As a developer, Safari is a dog (and now touted to be [the next IE](http://nolanlawson.com/2015/06/30/safari-is-the-new-ie/)), but also owning a lot of Apple products, it pisses me off that Apple doesn't show face in any forums or any meetups/conferences to face the bullshit they're putting out. My only guess is that they think they're being endearing by being all secretive and spontaneous. They forgot that Jobs was the guy who could make that work. They just look like knobs."
"Anyway, yeah, I'll buy another iPhone because I still find it a lot nicer to use than Android, but my patience is wearing thin. So sad when they could really be an amazing company if they just pulled finger.My brother had a galaxy s2 and decided Samsung was awful and Android was disgusting so naturally went for apple."
"Five or six years later he is saying he hates apple and is going for Android..."
"Considering how much he hates Android it must mean that apple have fucked up his trustI haven't been satisfied with OSX since Snow Leopard, plain and simple.There is also the fact their obsession with thinness is starting to hurt their products. The bendy iPhone 6, terrible battery life, the fact they are apparently going to remove the headphone jack from future iPhones. Imagine a world where you have to spend extra for pair of headphone (because they will need to include there own built in dac and amp) you can't use on any device that doesn't have a lightening port. Any other company would call that madness Apple will call it the iPhone 7. Former Apple fanboy checking in...  can confirm. Apple software has really declined in quality. I started using Mac in 2004. I got an iBook G4 and an iPod click wheel. They were magical. They worked like a dream and the software/hardware integration worked great. So then over the years I bought an iMac,  iPad,  Apple TV, and two iPhone with much the same amazement. They were magical. Well except the last iPhone. The second iPhone is where I started to notice things were getting worse. It was an iPhone 5 I bought in late 2012. It was mostly the same as my old 3GS, it just looked a little better. I didn't think the level of innovation warranted the level of price but oh well. My iPad, iMac,  amd appleTV still worked well. Well kinda. ITunes began to be terrible and I never wanted anything to do with those apple cloud services. We got apple maps which was garbage and a bunch of native apps I never opened but that you couldn't delete. Android started to really pummel apple on terms of mobile os innovation,  and I was starting to notice I could work much better on my windows 7 pc at work,  and my functionality felt almost crippled on my iMac at home. So when it became time to buy a new phone and computer,  for the first time in 11 years I balked and decided to look at non-apple products. The it just works mantra having become long since untrue. Plus customization was almost non existent. Their native apps were garbage and an iMac in 2016 isn't vastly different from the one I bought in 2009, but the price is still around $1100 for the base model. "
"So all that said, I just built a Windows 10 PC and switched to Android last fall. Apple's software and functionality just became bad. Android isn't perfect but oh Lord the customization! I have so much more freedom. Apple was always so far behind with what they would allow. They only just allowed bitcoin apps,  3rd party keyboards and 3rd party widgets within the past year and a half or so. That and apple is super strict on allowing amazon apps to function fully (I couldn't download books directly from audible). "
"Now I've only just started using the windows pc,  but I can say that the performance I'm getting compared to the price I paid is far superior to the performance I would have gotten compared to the price I would've paid for the iMac. "
"I don't hate Mac. I'll still keep my old iMac as up to date as possible, but I don't know that all I've go back to it as my primary system now that I've seen the light. When I got my first mac,  Apple was competing against Micfosoft in a world where there was no YouTube,  no Gmail even,  no Facebook,  social media,  or Netflix streaming. Amazon was still mainly just a bookstore,  and Google just a search engine. ITunes demolished Winamp,  QuickTime was vastly superior to Windows Media Player. Office was still Microsoft's advantage, but apple had all kinds of extras and... It just worked. I think that is why many people went to Mac. Now in the age of improved Web content and 3rd party software development,  Apple's insular world just can't keep upI have a Macbook Pro I used for my DJ business.  It has a much older version of OSX on it because I refuse to upgrade.  I've heard nothing but nightmares about how this piece of software or that piece just stopped working properly after upgrading.  One of my buddies began asking for an older OSX disc so he could wipe his machine and downgrade."
"I'm now getting warnings that Chrome isn't supported in the OS version I'm running and I won't get anymore updates.  Can I play music and DJ properly?  Because that's all I give a shit about."
"Hey Apple - stop breaking shit for people that actually rely on having their machines work for business purposes.As someone who worked for Apple during and after Steve Jobs' time, and one who saw the internal degredation of internal systems, it's about damn time for Apple to actually start listening to the overwhelming feedback we're seeing from all spectrums: the press, consumers, and developers. They need to move away from the annualized OS releases (that, admittedly began under Jobs' control) and seriously give their software teams the time that it takes to truly rebuild some of their core services and applications. I know this is anecdotal but my fiancee and I used to love sharing and managing our photos with Apple's solutions (iPhoto, Aperture, etc.) but now, Photos on both iOS and OS X are damn near unusable. Not to mention, the iCloud integration being a damn mess, making it impossible to even view some of our photos on the Mac at times. It just works hasn't really applied since the end of Snow Leopard and iOS 4, arguably. "
"Edit2: Forgot to mention that their Server app is absolutely atrocious nowadays (also, arguably since Snow Leopard when it was an actual variation on the OS and not just an app as it is now). To further cement the idea that Apple has become too big and doesn't give a damn, just take a look at the reviews for their last several Server iterations; it's clear that QA has gone out the window and Apple doesn't even look at the feedback as the same issues have persisted... since 2008. People seem to love hating on Microsoft, but I'd rather support a company willing to listen to the feedback of their consumers (the blood of any business), than one that's willing to ignore simple requests made by the people who lined their wallets. "
"Edit: punctuationThey charge a premium but deliver average hardware with limited software. It seems like they are milking as much as possible. It does not bode well for their future financial reports. There is someone in the CEO seat, but he is not paying attention to who really matter: customers. Tim Cook can only think about the supply chain or his next TV show appearance. He reminds me of John Sculley or maybe Michael Spindler. That is not a good sign either.Here I am, three years into my iPhone, and I still cannot figure out the differences between iCloud drive,  Photos, iCloud photo library, iCloud photo sharing, Photo Streaming, iTunes backup, iCloud backup. What's worse, Microsoft, against which Apple always measured its software's elegance and seamlessness, has shed its old shortcomings -- its Windows 10, released last year, garnered almost universal raves."
"Windows 10 hardly received universal raves, but it was certainly received better than many of Apple's recent software projects.I hate finding posts like this so far after they get posted, when I have strong feelings on the post."
"I'm a sys admin, primarily Windows, but I do like Apple products.  I have been saying for the past year, they are slipping.  They have basically stopped updating Carplay, which is an awesome start, but could be so much more.  Then there is iOS, Apple has for the most part had smooth releases and few issues, but now more and more they are releasing problematic updates.  Things like Podcasts crash regularly.  I have been a fan of iOS because of it's stability and just working, because I don't want/have the time to tinker with my phone, I need it to work.  Well, that's going away.  Unless Apple does something, to get back on track to where they used to be, I'm losing interest.  Then there is the whole fact that they had a great thing with Siri, but now all competitors are better than it now, because they have been improving, meanwhile Siri has gotten worse if anything.  People poop on Apple, but they have always made up for maybe not the most top end hardware by delivering a consistent experience, good battery life, etc, and they are no longer delivering on that.I still have my original Mac Classic. I've got a Powermac, and two Macbook Pros."
"iTunes is, in my opinion, the worst thing Apple has ever done and it has been since the very beginning. It's worse now than it used to be, but I hated the way it did basically everything right from the get-go. I also thought that iOS was novel when it first came out, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't getting pretty tired of its shit by now. I've got an iPod and an iPad, I've also got an Android phone and tablet. With the possible exception of spending money in the app and iTunes store, basically everything I might want to do with one of my iOS devices is significantly more of a pain in my ass than it is with my Android devices."
"Full disclaimer, I'm a sysadmin and manage several networks that converge Apple, Microsoft, and Linux technologies. Over the last decade, working with Microsoft and Linux technologies has gotten easier, and working with Apple technologies on both the end-user and server level has become more and more of a pain in my ass. A perfect example is how Apple has deprecated AFP and they want everyone to use SMB. Not a problem, right? SMB has become pretty standard in basically all hybrid environments at this point because you can reliably host and connect to it on basically anything nowadays. Except on Macs, that is. Each of the major Mac OS releases for the last four years has had some horrible bug in its SMB client implementation that has made it suck. In Mountain Lion there was the share enumeration bug, in Mavericks, Yosemite, and El Capitan there are intermittent and serious performance problems as well as problems with corrupted file permissions and the goddamned Finder previewer locking files while it generates document previews and then never fucking unlocking them."
"You know what I don't need Apple? I don't need a fancy new flat design language for the OS, and I don't need you to go and make arbitrary changes to your desktop paginator. What I do need is to not have Finder lock all of the files in a goddamned directory whenever someone views it so it can generate preview images which causes me to get constant angry phone calls from 40 goddamned artists because they can't save the documents they were working on because they're in use."
"Fix the core tech and then worry about the pretty shit."
"**Whew** that got a little rantier than I had intended.Have an iPad with iOS 7. Avoided upgrading because I didn't have enough space on the iPad (Well, Apple, you are the shit fuckers that won't allow SD cards), but anyway. Finally, after probably a year I backed up all my stuff and upgraded because many apps were no longer working and I needed iOS 9 for them to do their thing. "
"Upgraded. iPad no longer connects to wi-fi. So the good news is I won't have to upgrade my iPad any more. > Apple, you are the shit fuckers that won't allow SD cards"
"That's 90% of the tech market right now. Google's line of devices included. It's impractical, but you can do [inverse tethering](http://www.howtogeek.com/214259/how-to-reverse-tether-an-iphone-or-ipad-to-your-pc-or-mac/?PageSpeed=noscript) from your PC/Mac to your phone. Okay, as someone who isn't an Apple guy, for stuff that just works I find it really doesn't."
"I had to get a screenshot off a students iPhone to use in a bullying case. First, I had to find a fucking proprietary cable. Because fuck everyone else."
"I plug it in. "
"I expect to be able to navigate to it like a thumbdrive, as the helpful notification said it was acting that way."
"No sign of the file. Nothing. Everything is locked away unless you're signed into iTunes as the same user as on the phone (apparently. I never actually succeeded in getting the file).But they are absolutely *nailing* the emoji marketThey seem to make the UX worse and worse with several of their apps (Music app on the iPhone for one). Instead of spending that time on useless changes that only serve to confuse users, they could add desired functionality (being able to edit song information on the phone, for one thing?) But nope.I don't experience the bugs in the article, but I've had numerous hardware failures (some out of the box), and some apps are mangled messes. "
"Photos? Is *every* photo in Ive's library geotagged and date stamped? Cause if it is he can go through my scanned and slide converted photos and tag every single one of them! He can then explain why the library file is near double that of the raw imports. Nikon and Picasa don't need 85% more space."
"Messages is also a synchronized mess. You know that I saw the message on the laptop less than a meter from the phone. Tag read and deleted - why do I need both (it isn't encryption, as the message tag could be leveraged independently)."
"Mail and Calendar on Exchange... Hopeless. And one of the problems with enterprise adoption."
"Contacts is a look-and-feel nightmare. Did someone see FileMaker Pro in 2005 and think 'good enough'? Provide a means to see groups within contacts, and provide some default actions. Enter a phone number that's registered to iCloud? Tag it iPhone instead of 'other'. Or better, let me set the defaults without having to fight the system."
"Lastly, I'd love to run iOS apps on the Mac. But don't brain-damage OS X to do it. Just let me access a simple emulation like Xcode without the overhead for *any* app. Absolutely true. And then there's the hard to repair hardware, glued-in batteries and banning us from rolling back to previous IOS versions. As top comment said, fuck iTunes.  Been a vile piece of software I've been forced to use on occasion.   Sometimes you can't avoid it.I own Android, my kid owns an iPad.  ITUNES is the most furiously frustrating piece of SW that I have ever used.  It is so unbelievably bad, it is like thinking of infinity.  It blows my mind.  ITUNES is the ONLY reason why I will never buy Apple.  Period.What used to be simple and intuitive has become a complex mess of gunk that constantly attempts to steer you to Apple pay services such as iCloud and Apple Music.  iTunes has always been horrific but after iOS 8 the music player app became nearly as bad.  "
"After being a iPod and iPhone lover for many years - my 6s will likely be traded for Android.  Sorry Apple - ditch your finance and marketing guys and go back to what you used to do best.ITunes is why I refuse to use any apple tech garbage >  Raise your hand if you have a folder on your iPhone full of native Apple apps you never use ... yup, that's a lot of you, Engadget's Nathan Ingraham wrote last week."
"I have this same folder and it's labeled [Meh](http://imgur.com/sUjNhPc).Apple lost me when they stopped producing machines that could be easily upgraded using industry-standard parts.  I sent feedback to them countless times, suggesting they build a machine about the size and form of a mini tower like the Quadra 700 again, but of course they never did anything like that because of their absolute obsession with iDevices."
"The desktop ain't dead, guys.  This is what I need and want:"
"http://apple-history.com/700I went to buy a trackpad yesterday."
"PS110. more than 1/4 the cost of the Mac Mini I was buying. "
"What. On. Earth. If I wasn't tied into to the eco system I'd leave because I find Apple software crashing far more than it ever used to, on new machines. "
"Ahh, but this one vibrates. Er. There's a completely useless feature.iTunes has never been good at any point in history, but I'm glad Apple users have caught up to 2001.Tim Cook isn't an entrepreneur. He's an operator.  A money man.  Cool enough guy and all, but he's not the crazy maker Apple needs.  They've simply lost their culture.  Products don't just work anymore.  It's just money now. R.I.P. Steve Jobs."
"I don't know why anyone is surprised. The same thing happened to Apple when Steve Jobs left the first time. Quality went way down. Innovation went away. Usability became a non-focus. This is what happens when you let business people, not innovators, run a company.> It's doubtful that Apple's millions of devoted users, locked into its interoperable ecosystem of Macs, iPhones, and iPads, will think about abandoning the company any time soon. "
"* I'm building my first PC since 2007."
"* I'm looking at Android phones for my next upgrade."
"* I'll probably add a new battery and SSD to my iPod Classic and stay just about that deep into the Apple ecosystem."
"I'm tired. I'm tired of bloated software. I'm tired of things taking longer than they should. I am tired of them switching all their services over to a monthly payment system. Want to back up your info? Pay us. Want us to catalogue your music and store that in the cloud too? Pay us again. Want to listen to the radio on your Mac? Pay us again. I'm over Software as a Subscription. I'm over Apple's politics. I'm over the proprietary nature of everything. I can't replace my own RAM now? I can't replace my own HDD (or SSD) which WILL fail eventually? How much does Apple charge to do that? $600 because you have to replace the whole logic board. Eff that. "
"I got this far in the article and stopped: There always have been two great virtues in Apple's policy of keeping the development of hardware and core software in-house: their seamless integration with each other and their quality."
"Apples hardware and Operating Systems are nicely engineered, and always have been, but their applications, particularly their media software, are steaming piles of garbage, and have been for probably two decades at this point."
"Attempting to manage devices with ITunes has always made me want to stab myself in the ear with a pencil, and I think that Quicktime gave me PTSD back in the mid-90s.SysAdmin here, I consult with a talent agency, Windows environment. Now they have gone through the decision to upgrade everyone to iMacs, which I thought was ridiculous at first. But imo Macs are super easy to manage way less issues and troubleshooting with them. And just one Mac mini as an OS X server installed is quite amazing. But iTunes is horrible and I don't know anyone who uses photos app. And the Windows infrastructure we built will be useless now. "
"TLDR Macs are ok for certain applications, and iTunes should have stuck with the early versions of iTunes. And don't use photos appOS X and iOS are still great for meThis is why the only Apple product I own is the phone provided by work."
"I've always thought everything about them was about as back-asswards and user friendly as a kitchen knife that doesn't have a handle. Sure, it'll get the job done, but you'll wish you used something else--even though they really marketed the hell out of that kitchen knife and got you to pay 3x the price of a normal knife because it has a nifty little Apple logo that looks really pretty when the blood starts to pool in it.I like the simplicity of a common hardware/OS platform, but I started to delay OSX upgrades due to bugs and new features I didn't want let alone use. I'm now 2 versions behind current (10.9 Mavericks) and will not be updating OS nor buying new Macs any time soon. My main mac is a 6 year old iMac with i7 processors and recently upgraded SSD and 3Tb hard drive that will see it good for another several years.  iPhones and iPads are not being updated past iOS 7 for performance and feck-iCloud reasons.I agree with a lot of the things said here, but as a converter from android, I don't see what Android does better. They also have tons of stability and security updates, then release a whole new OS a year later with a ton of problems, apps that work without tweeks are far and wide in between. "
"But I do agree that apple's integrated apps are terrible. I used to love iCloud photos, now it just freezes all the time, same with iTunes. :/Apple is really falling apart. There is an annoying bug that started in iOS9 with the bluetooth. Some cars, like the MyLink in Chevy's and the Mercedes systems, that when the phone is connected to the car it forces all audio through bluetooth. So if you open up fb, it changes the radio from XM to Bluetooth etc. Apple has acknowledged he issue is on their end and they would have a fix. That was 9 months ago.I'm a long time Apple user (MacBook/iphone), however I cannot stand iTunes and iPhoto. "
"I no longer update iOS on my phones after having the wifi on my 4 and 5S permanently disabled by updates in the past. So many customers complained about these bugs at the time but Apple did nothing. "
"I hope they get their shit together soon and allow me to restore confidence in their products again. I called this out a year ago and Reddit Apple fanboys totally down voted me when I said those in the know are moving off Apple.   "
"Right now those in the know are migrating away because at one point,  Apple was the premium but now are just becoming a Samsung clone.  And the corresponding responses are people who haven't figured that out yet, or legitimately people satisfied with the Apple tech universes.  It takes a while before you see the slide down, but I'll be watching this number as they squeeze as much as they can out of it before people catch on.  Most my die hard tech friends are already migrating. You had one Jobs...iPhoto - fucking iPhoto! There was a while, back maybe, 2006 - 2008 where my wife and I were exclusively using Macs. It started off nice, enjoyed the first iPhone a lot and all the movies and pictures we would take of our children would sync into iPhoto - great! Or so I thought... ."
"Flash forward towards the end of 2008, iPhoto started to disappoint me. Became hard to organize things, having to import/export to iMovie was a joke, plus at the time, there was no working cloud option(for a mac - don't get me started on how shitty MobileMe was) and I was terrified that I'd loose all of our family photos/movies in a house fire. Seriously, if our house burned down, the only material things I'd care about loosing would be those. "
"Anyway, Google started offering huge amounts of cloud storage so I thought - great backup option! Now to get all my stuff into the cloud.... nope. First of all, my wife and I had separate iPhoto libraries - do you think we could merge those? Nope. Do you think you could easily export or sync with any cloud based solution? Nope. And worst, oh worst of all, AFTER I'd finally said 'fuck it' to our Macs, I found out that the 'mov' format Apple imported my camera's videos wasn't the ubiquitous QuickTime format (which is itself shifty) but some weird-ass-only-playable-in-iPhoto bullshit. Rendering several years of movies taken of our two young daughters completely inaccessible on a PC (or anywhere else) without reencoding every. Single. One. "
"To this day, all my wife's family use iPhones and they are constantly battling with how to access their own media. I have given up trying to help them. For a company that was so forward thinking during the first decade of this century, they have completely lost the plot.You are now banned from /r/appleMmmm, yes...yes....let the hate flow through you...Some of you are not old enough to remember when Internet Explorer died.  It literally dominated the browser world.  After being crown the king, what do you do?  You stop innovating.  You get complacent with your product.  What happens?  Well companies like Firefox kicks you to number 2 and then Chome comes out and kicks you to number 3.  Shoot, even firefox is making the same mistakes.  "
"Apple, I was a big fan of your products.  If you don't reinvent yourself by the time iPhone 7 comes out, you will rapidly lose users.  Oh one more thing, don't remove the 3.5mm headphone port.  That's not innovation.  Blackberry is a more recent example Dumped Apple years ago. Hated iTunes and the concept of a middleman between my phone and PC. Android is life. Plug your phone into your PC and it acts like a flash drive with its own folder. Boom. Win. Fuck you Apple and your shitty iTunes.Batteries you can't change easily..  have to get things repaired by their technicians..  non-standard charger cables..  expensive...  all made in China in a company that needs a suicide net. Fashion victim fanboys and girls..."
"I don't own anything made by Apple and I don't want to.I still haven't updated to the latest OS (still running Mavericks) because of the display issues Yosemite has. Until that's fixed I'll continue to use Mavericks. "
"I also had to stop using Mail because it just stopped working. "
"That said, I'm not planning to move on any time soon. There are too many things about Mac OS I still like. I'm on  El Capitan and it's the smoothest running OS I've had on my 2010 MacBook Pro. Mavericks was a disaster. I couldn't shut down my laptop without holding the power button, so it literally took days to install new updates on it in the hopes that I could shut the thing down like normal. Plus the entire OS was laggy as shit. Not a good combination for a junior in college with a writing-intensive major.El cap fixed a lot of display issues for meI admit, didn't read article, just wanted to say this:"
"#Remember BlackBerry?this needs more attention, and Apple fans should help this get more attention. it benefits us for Apple to do better. I was an Apple fan for years, but have begun to slowly replace my equipment already, I have always been a gamer but nothing Apple offered was suitable, so I saved for awhile and built a gaming desktop with Windows 10 as my new main computer. And in the times I've been using it I feel the experience is just a little bit smoother than my Mac, which is felt especially in the past few months had been getting sluggish. I was at the point where reinstalling the OS would've been my third time in the two years is owned it, something id never had to do in the four years before I'd been on a MBP. "
"And don't even get me started on fucking Home Sharing. I have a huge media collection and want to bounce it everywhere in my house, and apple seems intent to offer me that option provided I sacrifice them a goat or something to keep the spirits happy. I deserted for Android about 18 months ago after a couple of iPhones and an iPad. At upgrade-time the salesperson kept pushing me back toward Apple just because You already have Apple devices and you want it all to work together. I bought a phone and tablet (and an iPod for the kid) - don't recall selling my soul to them for the rest of my life. "
"I still use the iPad for some music-related things but it's kind of shit that I have moved apps that keep crashing from my tablet to my (Android) phone and the phone handles them perfectly smoothly. It was easier for me to switch knowing I still had the iPad and wasn't losing money on apps I'd bought and still used. "
"Once I changed to Android, I wished I'd done it so much earlier. I'd always hated the look of it for some reason, without realising the billions of options there are for changing that. Customisation is nice but things like expandable storage and basic reliability are much bigger reasons to switch. Apple devices treat you like you must be a complete moron who can't be trusted with your own devices - and you pay extra for the privilege. That alone should be enough. Who wants to pay to be treated with contempt?> expandable storage and basic reliability are much bigger reasons to switch."
"The expandable storage isn't a panacea because so much software out there will not move to external storage, including just about any Google app that shipped with the device.  "
"I've got an LG tablet that came with 8Gb built in memory and I've added a 64Gb SD card to it (ironically enough, I got it for free when I bought my iPhone6).  I've moved everything that I can over to the SD card and yet I still had the one and only first game that I've ever tried to install on it complain that it can't update the game data due to storage.  "
"It's like these Android developers learned nothing from the bad old days of DOS.  All that extra storage doesn't actually function intuitively or with any elegance or like normal storage should."
"Also, as this is my second Android device, the first being an HTC phone that I used for two years before getting the iPhone6s, I can say with great conviction that Android is not more stable, is not as refined and is only as functional as iOS.  But scrolling isn't as good, the display glitches out, stalls, and otherwise feels more fragile than any iOS device I've ever used.  "
"It works but it's still not quite there in refinement or UX, and don't get too attached to any nifty feature your device might have because these various hardware companies have complete ADHD and love putting one-off gadgets in their device that won't be supported by either them or Android in perhaps just one or two updates."
"In both cases, with the HTC and the iPhone, they both seem to be better at all the PDA type stuff and apps than they are as actual phones.  Which, is fine I guess, because I don't like phones, I bought them mostly for the camera.At BSDcon I met two programmers that discovered code that Apple had contributed back to the BSD project that contained comments like this will fail the first time the user clicks but the user will just click againYes yes, let the hate flow through you.What's worse, Microsoft, against which Apple always measured its software's elegance and seamlessness, has shed its old shortcomings -- its **Windows 10**, released last year, garnered **almost universal raves.**"
"From this quote, I think I'll take this article with a whole bag of salt.The two big things that bother me are:"
"My phone reminding me 2-3 times a day about an update and forcing me to click a few careful options to avoid it auto updating."
"iCloud mysteriously enabling itself on my phone and Macbook randomly every now and then.I've hated itunes since the very first time I used it years ago.  "
"Was forced to use it again recently, god how I hate itunes and the 'whole package integration', no wonder Android is so popular now.Can confirm. I've been using exclusively Macs since 98. My first computer was a PowerMac G3. (OS 8)"
"That being said I've lost all faith in the brand getting any better. I'm sick and tired of iTunes requiring constant updates, and trying to be the fucking hub through which all my media defaults. It's a fucking music player, and a shitty one at that. I don't want or need it to do anything else. And I sure as hell don't want to have to use that piece of shit to sync my phone. It's a pain in the ass."
"I don't update the software on my mobile devices anymore, and haven't for years now because it fucks up the way the devices run. It's as though they use the software updates to speed up the process of engineered obsolescence. > speed up the process of engineered obsolescence"
"Duh."
"The new updates become more and more demanding, making your phone run shittier and shittier, until you stop getting updates at all (admittedly longer than the competition for the most part)"
"It's to push you out the door faster."
"Apple sure makes some fine products, but iTunes in one of the shittiest software products ever madeThank goodness for jailbreaking iphones, while I own an iphone they just get worse with every update that I end up avoiding doing any sort of updating until it's 100% required.Apple doesn't seem to let you do things without pain. Even to send contacts from a sim card to another phone (I phone) relied on iTunes or third party apps when I tried last year. "
"It's nice to not lag but when you don't have so many functions, there's a reason why it's so quick. I've been putting off my iphone's software update for two weeks, this update doesn't have a don't ask me again option so I'm going to have to hit don't download and no once a day until this garbage can be replaced.It's very nice to know I'm not alone in hating Itunes...Long time Apple user here. The Apple music update killed the ability to play my own music AND wouldnt play apple music streaming either for the first week. Considering thats the main use for my phone, straight to android. I've hated the company for about 4 years now. They really inhibit the user year experience by trying to force everyone to have the same one (I.e.customizability hasn't been in Apple's diction for a long time). This was all for the sake of providing a smooth, integrated user experience, since modular ones are ostensibly more clunky.  And now they're even failing on making smooth software? Garbage. Inexcusable garbage.Maybe....just maybe, because they're waking up to the overpriced shit Apple's producing?"
"I mean, iPen? Gimme a fucking break, will ya?Apple could have$10 a month from me for apple music but I'm sticking ng with Spotify as the app is so much easier to use and discover music imo. "
"Most apple software (apart from the operating systems) has never felt special to me. I've always found the competition just as good or better. Ironically, this is the year I chose to switch to the 6S Plus... so I don't have much to compare with except for the 4S as that was my last iPhone. It's still snappy to me - in spite to the updates - probably because I currently use it mostly for browsing or texting. "
"One thing I have noticed is that Apple's incremental upgrades seem to be getting smaller and smaller with each new model. It's like Apple is trying to see how much they can get by in order to do as little work as possible but reaping in the profits. I didn't follow the hype for the 6/6 Plus, but not a lot of people hyped about the 6S models either unless they were hardcore fans. "
"One thing I had been hoping for, in regards to iTunes, was that they'd partner up with Spotify or Pandora... let those guys handle the software. iTunes is abysmal, I've previously had issues where my iphone would sync with some books and music that didn't show up the next time because the settings I had last time defaulted. "
"As for updates.. I have always believed that it should not matter how many updates the company comes out with (in this case Apple, as opposed to Android where you have to wait for aeons to get the update to certain models and/or carrier), but those updates shouldn't be to cover bugs or glitches. It could be some kind of bullet point or something, but otherwise, it just seems like some team didn't have enough time to debug their software before they rush to another project. Not trying to make assumptions on how that company is run, but it's slightly reminiscent of some of the recent games that had been so buggy because developers want to get a product out there on time and later had to give refunds to a bunch of people for the terrible product. "
"I have many Apple products - either as a result of winning raffles or just when I bought my Macbook. I think the laptops are golden, they work really well and I know that four years from now, provided the updates don't get so crazy that I gotta start paying for them, I'll be able to use this computer and it's faster than my Windows. Cellphones? Eh, hit or miss. Sometimes I wonder if they have a backlog of features they have to work on... but it's not necessarily what the consumer wants. Haven't had much experience with iWatch but I'd love to hear people's feedback on that in relation to the article though.Itunes is now Apples primary interface with the clients hardware suite and it is simply appalling. Every new release is like.. so where's that button gone and what's it hiding as now. I use it as little as possible even though I'm sure it could do lots for me but I simply don't have the time or inclination to wade through endless trial and error trying to work out synch settings, UI changes, password change blah blah... It just works?. Oh no it doesn't!Here's a genuine question. Does anyone know how to.. and actually routinely use the cut and past on an iphone. I spend so much time getting rid of cut and paste options that I never use; they're the modern equivalent of the microsoft paper clip.If you think Apple apps run badly on Macs, try running them on PCs. Im a designer by trade and use macs at work and at home. For me mavericks is the best and I'm sticking with it. I have Yosemite on the office machine but my personal ones are mavericks. "
"I abandoned iphones (used them since day1) recently for a Moto G3, best decision I've made in years.I had an iPhone since the first one until the iPhone 4. It was amazing."
"All my childhood dreams were in my pocket, I was definitely an apple fan, but still used a PC."
"Then one day I went and play with a Galaxy s3, and was immediately hooked and never looked back. Just about the same time I bought an iMac, and that was the worst mistake I ever made in my tech life."
"What a piece of garbage. I'm waiting for the day my apartment will catch on fire just so I'll have an excuse to go back to the good old PC.Urghh, since the recent update I'm not even able to use my extra long charger anymore because it's not an official product. I have to huddle next to the plug socket with the ridiculously minuscule one Apple provides. They're becoming stupidly restrictiveAnd people still buy their products, no matter how much they mess with their costumersCan't say much about iTunes but their developer console is just sad."
"It took me hours to figure out the workflow.Well, they had a good run. They'll stay afloat for decades to come with the loyal following Jobs built up for them.I was a big fan at one point of time. Macbook (first gen macbook aluminium and an mbp 15 inch) , iPhone (1,3,4s), iPod (video and shuffle), iPad (1 and 2). I think right after the iPhone 4s I started hating apple products. It first started with the phone and the iPad. There was literally no difference between the two at one point of time. I was rather bored of the UI and just having a lot of tiles lined up over a screen. I was rather pissed off that after a big iOS update, my iPads were extremely slow and could not for the love of god, load multiple pages in safari before crashing. "
"My MBP 15 inch survived for a mere 3 years before succumbing to a GPU meltdown , after updating to Mac OS X Mavericks (I cant remember the OS name at the moment, but it was a known issue for my line of laptops). "
"I first transitioned away from the mobile line, i went over to a Samsung Galaxy S3, and absoluetly loved it. Then my laptop died and I went over to an Asus. I have never looked back, I can do so much without any restrictions without having to jailbreak my system in order to customize my systems. "
"Today the only apple product I currently use is my good old iPod Video and my really slow iPad 2. I really miss looking at an apple product and saying Wow, that's amazing or Gosh, it looks really awesome. None of their products resonate that way with me anymore (bearing the latest 12-inch macbook air ) the rest of their line up looks about the same as it did 5-6 years ago. The software experience is eye-popping and extremely fluid for about a year or two. When a big update comes, your system feels slow and dreadful---which I think is the cue from Apple to get your shit upgraded. "
"I'm running Linux on my Mac.All Apple need to do to get me to go back is add an SD card slot that I can put my standard mp3's, movies and pictures on without having to recode them and deal with fucking itunes and be able to backup my contacts, texts whatsapps etc to it. Thats it, I dont even require them to let me install apps on to it. Its bloody simple!I am an Apple fan, but they are right. The quality and reliability has slipped since Steve Jobs passed away. Even the updates to fix problems sometimes feel like they don't fix the problem, or leave you with a new one. I don't use many of their native apps. And Apple Mail on the macbook is the worst program in the world and I refuse to open my mail with it.  If I have opened it in years it was only due to clicking it by mistake."
"I do still think their products are excellent products. But they've lost ground in leading the industry and for good reason. In the cell phone market a lot of new advances are really gimmicks. Apple has done well to not follow that path. But it's feeling like they are going to fall into those traps. Happy with android and even more with Moto X. Was thinking of buying iPhone only for its excellent camera. But after reading this, no chance. itunes absolutely suck balls for uploading music onto my phone...glad I bought an AK 320."
"All I need to do is drag and dropI tried iTunes once... Apple Itunes"
"Not even once."
".jpegSo did the Apple fans finally find out how bad the software really is ?Is this the latest Apple is doomed post? I am truly not sure because there are so many of them lately.My big complaint is their support of OpenCL, a programming language which they helped develop.  The CPU version that ships with all Apple computers only runs on one core... what is the point?  And their compiler, clang, has really poor support of OpenMP.  One can always upgrade by hand.  However, it's ridiculous that there isn't support for this out-of-the-box, especially given how outrageously expensive Apple computers are.  "
"I've had colleagues complain about their shoddy OpenGL support as well.  And then I have other colleagues who use Apples for development!  I've never been able to figure it out; I think they just like the luxury factor of having a Mac, and don't have to pay for it themselves.Apple is like the soup Nazi.  The worst they treat their customers, the more the customer wants the product.Eventually even the most unobservant people realize they're getting fucked.This is their problem. They designed everything to only work one way, every process is as simple as a button press, but there is no other way to accomplish the task. In fact, they go out if their way to lock things down to prevent you from finding an alternate method. When everything works right, it's fine, but if something gets messed up or an app isnt working right, there is no work around, and there is no way to find or fix the bug. That function just doesn't exist anymore until you buy a new one, or if you're lucky, a factory reset will erase everything on the device, and MAYBE fix the problem. I can sum this up very easily.  I suggested to my son that I get him a MacBook or similar for University.  He asked if he could put Linux on it!Saw it coming....Jobs is gone again."
"However, this time, they cannot lure him back. Or it will be challenging at least.I'll probably get a lot of hate for this, but this really isn't surprising to me. I've been saying for years that there is nothing superior about iPhone in comparison to other devices. They are, simply put, glorified smartphones because Apple got out the gate first and advertised best. But when you look at them in comparison to other products, they pale in comparison on many levels. Sure, they can connect across multiple platforms, and connectivity is great, but in all honesty, I can do the same thing on my phone, PC, tablet, etc. by simply using the same Gmail (or similar program) account. The things that once made them great are now just the norm. They're nothing to write home about by any stretch, it's just a lot of bandwagonning and nostalgia, and people who are too sucked into the myth to see what is actually going on.Apple software is all about what you *can't do* now. Can't install software outside of the App Store... Can't transfer music to the devices you want... Can't properly use MVNOs with their phones..."
"I am honestly shocked that they haven't moved MacBooks to iOS at this point and forced you to jailbreak them.forget software, why the fuck can't I plug ANYTHING into my $700 ipad?  One fucking connection port. I suspect that while Steve Jobs was a jerk he really did care about the product first. Now that he's dead concern over profit, shareholders, etc. is slowly superseding the concern of making really good products.I wish they would open up MacOS X more to make hackintoshing less of a chore.  I would gladly pay for MacOS X on non-apple hardware.  I've worked in a UNIX/Linux related role for 20+ years (sysadmin, development, sre etc) and I've tried just about everything looking for a solid desktop experience and MacOS X brings me the best of both worlds (nice interface but with the power of UNIX close at hand).  Sadly though Apple hardware just isn't keeping up with my needs.  My last few desktop builds have all been hackintosh because for the money of a MacPro I can get a lot more bang for the buck that fits my needs better with much more room for expansion in the case.  My last few laptops have been from Sager for the same reason.  I can buy newer and more powerful hardware for much cheaper than an Apple device.  Hackintoshing is a pain in the ass, I don't deny that.  But at the end of the day it is my only route right now to get what I want without feeling like I'm being ripped off with overpriced hardware that doesn't really fit my need."
"With that said, MacOS X itself has declined in quality the last several releases.  They want to make it iOS like, but that isn't the reason people use it.  Keep my phone/tablet OS on those devices and keep making a great OS for the desktop.  Those two goals are not the same thing because they are ending up with a situation of doing more with less (phone/tablet) and less with more (desktop) and both end up losing.  "
"I'm also rather pissed that my iPad mini (first gen) that used to be able to do things with ease gets slower and slower with each OS update.  It takes a few minutes to render espn.com in safari on it now, and it used to load instantly as an example.This will be the reason why after a 1 year break from Samsung to let the wife go Apple we're both switching back to Samsung.  "
"I can't wait for the S7 Edge+ then 12 months later the wife gets out of her contract to sell that shitty Iphone 6+ and take the latest Samsung phone.  "
"Android has much more freedom and to be honest it's almost like a PC since i can do almost anything i could ever dream of on an Android phone with ease.But new phone, tablet, and laptop customers may be taking a closer look at alternatives, including Google Android-powered units as well as Microsoft devices, than they might have only a couple of years ago."
"This is very much me. I've been an Apple fan since those fruit-colored iMacs came out at the turn of the century, and I've pretty much owned every version of the iPhone. "
"But over the last two years, I've slowly moved everything I do on the software side to Google products (gmail, calendar, photos, etc), especially on mobile, and now I've been wondering if I shouldn't just be using a Google Nexus. I've heard people say that the iPhone is the best Google phone out there, but damned if I'm not thinking that may not be the case anymore.Apple music is just.... Broken :/I remember a time when Itunes WAS  a good software product... Oh wait.. no, I cant remember a time..  Anyone else feeling like software in general is becoming more and more half-baked and messy? It seems five years ago products had a lot less flaws than nowadays.It boils down to how the management structure of the company has changed since Jobs died. It was a terrible personality trait, but his megalomania churned out a huge number of great products with a singular vision. "
"The Tim Cook era is giving us me-too ideas and software that feels like it was designed by a committee of people that didn't have any consensus. You can feel this in Apple products as of late, and that is why people are starting to speak up. The golden era is gone, and I think people are finally realizing that Cook isn't the type of visionary leader or hardass that Apple needed to maintain that greatness. "
"Got a 3 and a half year old iphone 5 on ios7, love the damn thing, still runs like a charm and the battery is solid. But I know as soon as it does I'm jumping ship.Apple was only ever good, when it was good, because of Steve Jobs. And now Steve Jobs is dead. Totally agree with this. They've never been great at software outside of OS X, but I'm more upset that they've stopped innovating in the hardware dept, especially in their phones. How hard would it have been to come up with some new killer feature that nobody knew they wanted until they got it, like a wide-angle selfie lens or wireless charging or a week-long battery or literally ANYTHING else?!When OS X came out it was an amazing piece of software. It really set the standard for a useable and useful operating system."
"I can count on one hand the number of great pieces of software by Apple to come out for OS X since then. They've completely dropped the ball. Linux has always been great in a Linux is free if your time is worth nothing sort of way - which is to say, it's excellent, but only if you want to spend hours a month fixing a broken system."
"Windows on the other hand... I still feel like it's useless as a development platform for anything other than the slaved-in C#/.NET development crowd. But as an OS, it's just been getting better and better. I still scratch my head at how people complain about the new home screen system. The first thing I do in Linux is disable my desktop manager - the golden rule, for me, is to minimize time spent with the mouse. Windows' new UI is *perfect* for mouseless interaction. I rarely use the tiles as anything other than information panels, but I use the 'type to launch' feature (like Spotlight on OS X but better) all the time (when I'm stuck on Windows). The auto-updates need work, but frankly OS X auto updates suck as well.There designs are getting shit to for example charging the pencil, charging the mouse, the iphone battery case, the iphone camera lens that sticks out, the ios music app is shit. List goes on. I've had an iPhone for the past few years and I'm finally ready to make the leap to android. The only reason I have stayed so long was all the apps I have purchased. Honestly I have not had much problems with my iPhone but then again I don't keep it for more than 2 years but I have family who do keep their phones longer and they run like absolute crap. Same with old MacBooks and old Mac desktops at work. They are useless now and yet one of my coworker has a 10 year old PC with Windows 10 and it runs fine."
"Apple certainly has been going downhill lately. Very annoying. "
"And I say that as an apple fan for... Wow, thirteen years now.As someone who has hated apple software for years, welcome everyone!ITT: Fuck Apple, we've hated them all along!Two reasons I have not picked up an Apple device, lack of a micro-sd slot. If HTC can make their phone look visually appealing and still put in a micro-sd slot, so can apple. Its the same reason I refuse to now buy a Samsung phone."
"Second reason being, my intense hatred of itunes. I hate that bloated pos.itunes is the worst thing about using apple devices. moving to android and realizing that I could just dump mp3s on my phone as an external drive and install apps via apk downloaded from wherever I want was one of the most liberating experiences i've had with a smartphone ever and I'm **never** going back."
"people who have any sort of technical aptitude and yet still prefer apple are drinking the kool-aidThey keep trying so damn hard to reinvent the wheel and they know their rich apple fanboys will still pay the high fee just to get their hands on it. I miss the old iPods and iPhone up to the 4. They're more focused on the Apple *brand* and aesthetic than what consumers NEED Everything people have said is true about Apple. It sucks. Their music capabilities seem like a lie compared to Android. "
"I like ios education apps and their guided access though. For clients/work it's more effecient but personally android is my go to. When I want music on an ios device I use a Google app. "
"I never did understand the picture stuff.  I can never remember my iTunes account info so I gave up taking pictures with IOS unless I have then synced through a Google app. "
"The thing that pisses me off more then anything is they actively try to **stop** users from using **better** apps.  "
"Oh you want to you Google Maps? Fuck you, we're in a fight with Google so you're gonna use our shitty Apple Maps. "
"You want to make Spotify your default? FUCK YOU HERE'S A FULL PAGE AD FOR APPLE MUSIC. Using Apple products at this point is a bizarre and frustrating experience.  As a trivial example, one of the first things you have to do when setting up a new phone or computer is to declare your gender (i.e. Mr.,  Ms., etc.).  Really Apple?  Really?I just wish I could delete apps that i never use on my iphone.. I don't care about apple watch.. wtfI tried to transfer a few files to my wife's iPad the other day. Never again!Very disappointed in upgrading my macbook pro from mavericks to capitan. Safari has gotten bad enough with the most recent update that I might go back to using the battery hog Chrome. The split screen function that windows and my android phone can do well and I was excited to use seems to block using the two programs I want at random. The damn small window Apple apps Mail and Calendar won't go splitscreen together. The flat low color interface is boring too. I hate when my iphone just randomly starts playing music even when the headphones aren't in.  "
"Also,  I take the metro to work.  It has to go underground.  When I can't get to my music bc an ad for apples Streaming service can't load I want to throw my phone on the tracks.Nobody would care how bad updates are if you could just go back to before the update easily.It doesn't matter. All the bitching in this thread would make you think people aren't going to buy an unusable product, but all your fried have one, so you'll happily buy the next prove of shit that comes out...I refuse to update my iTunes and I refuse to update my iPhone 4. What a joke it has come to avoiding updates from the software developer. Very good chance I'll move to a surface pro this year. It will be the first time my personal computer hasn't been an Apple. I'm not a fan boy either. They were simply better (certainly more expensive) computers for a long time, but they've faltered in the last three or four years. I've always been a big fan of Mac OS, but it's becoming a monster. I still cant get over the fact that I cant independently change the volume on my alarm clock and my ringer. I still cant believe that my snooze time is permanently set to 9 minutes and cannot be changed. I cant believe I have to download a 3rd party keyboard to get swype functionality. Want to transfer files over bluetooth? Nope, gotta use icloud. Apple software is almost insulting to use. I can just imagine the ghost of Steve Jobs looking over my shoulder saying, well that's not how we want you to use it. I could never get past the lack of a right click on an apple mouse You aware that you can use literally any USB mouse on any OSX device, right? Yes, even magic ones that have two buttons.I wish they could make their fucking Apple TVs stream consistently.  My work outfitted every conference room with an Apple TV.  Nothing but problems.  The first half of most meetings is just trying to get connected to the fucking thing."
"Great hardware, but their software is really shitty.  I remember when iTunes didn't suck back when the original iPods were all that was around.I've been an iPhone user for 7 years. My next phone will likely not be an iPhone. I left the iPhone last year due to how terrible the local music listening experience had become.I've been an admirer of Apple *hardware* all my life.  Their displays, despite not being as good sounding in the spec sheets, somehow manage to *look* better, clearer, sharper, than my Note 4 QHD OLED screen.  Their cameras - 240fps @ 1080p, with minimal grain too?  That's simply astonishing for the price.  And their lightning connectors should have been established as the standard for *all* phones years ago, you can't improve on that."
"But because of Apple *software*, I'll never go anywhere near an Apple product in my life.The thing which really annoys me about Apple is that they refuse to release their development tools for other platforms. Even Microsoft has Visual Studio now available to use for Linux."
"While I can see from a business perspective it may seem better to only make it available to Apple products but consider for a moment the amount of developers who do not wish to use Apple products and so cannot developer apps for iOS. "
"There are many developers who would develop for iOS if it meant they didn't need to use Apple hardware and so Apple are missing the chance of having more developers creating apps for their OS. I'm not saying more developers and more apps is a good thing but having more developers creating apps increases the chance of another fantastic app being made.It's impossible for me to remove all the music from my iPhone. I double check and still somehow it leaves music on there. Any other program I could just go into the phone and see what's on there but instead I have to go through stupid fing iTunes. I haven't even had music on my iPhone (that I wanted) since streaming services were invited. So why must I use this horrible software?WTF did apple just replace iPhotos with. The new photos app looks like a work in progress, and is so non-intuitive to use.As someone who works in the field of Apple technical repairs, I agree completely.   iCloud fucking sucks, I don't use it, and I often suggest customers don't either, because its bad, buggy, and causes more problems than it solves.   Its actually easier to pull out a cable and manually sync the device through iTunes and Photos (previously iPhoto) than it is to just setup an iCloud account.   Nobody likes it.  The watch is an overpriced flop that serves very little purpose to all but the most devoted people who force it into their lives....your phone is in your pocket, you are spending $500+ to save literally 2 seconds of time to pull out your actual phone, its dumb.   The Macbook, ya know, that stupid thing with 1 shared port thats the exact same price as a Macbook Air but less than 50% as powerful?   I've seen 3 of them, total, since they came out, nobody buys them, nobody wants them, people see that and see the 13 Air right next to it and then you start to list the advantages and disadvantages of either unit and its not even a choice.   1-port, on board SSD, not upgradable, and spec wise its almost literally an iPad with a keyboard...its complete trash.  "
"As much as customers should be backing up their data, they still mostly do not, so on logic board SSD is the single stupidest idea in the history of the company.   70% or so of the inside of the Macbook is just empty space!   You're telling me you couldn't put a normal SSD stick (like the Air and Retina use) off the side with a connecting cable?!   Dumb, just dumb.   When I see someone out in the world with one of these (again, I've seen 3), I feel sorry for them and I hope they are backing up every single night.   If their video chipset dies (which Apple laptops are well known for doing), goodbye data!  "
"OSX is awful these days as well.   I hope you didn't setup iCloud, because now you'll have 500 popup messages on your screen all day long telling you to sign in!   Oh, you hit cancel because you don't wanna sign in right now?  We'll just assume you did that on accident and immediately bring the window back up to force you to hit cancel for a 2nd time to make it go away....I'm sure some of you have experienced that, and it gets worse if you setup Messages to sync with your phone, adding another double dialog cancel to your bootup routine.   When the first thing you have to do after booting your computer is hit Cancel 4 times in succession, you've done fucked up.  "
"They are still great computers and very secure (just get good anti-malware and a pop-up blocker or you'll get infected with malware pretty easily), but they are quickly declining in all aspects.Mac is still pretty solid, but I attribute that to being built on Unix over anything Apple has tried.What if a company made a product consumers wanted? That'd be a nice change.Consumers are still buyingRecord Mac and iPhone sales. Yeah, no one wants to buy that crap!You got downvoted, but you are exactly right.  Until people stop buying the new Apple shiny, they will stay on their current trajectory.  But it's not like people are stupid and are buying products they don't like. Sure, Apple software has gotten worse lately and it's not excusable whatsoever, but lots of people like Apple products and don't run into the same issues. It's not because they're brainwashed. They denied the Binding of Isaac Rebirth App... Enough is enoughMy issue with Apple is that they always limit what you can do. As someone who uses Linux where you can do about anything and seeing how you can't do really anything especially with phones unless you go through a tedious amount of things. Its annoying."
"Their latest news about 3rd party repair bricking for screen repairs etc.. is ridiculous in my opinion. "
"OH and of course the fact that I can build my own computer at least 2-3x better for the price they charge for one.Even basic system functionality sucks. Why does the Spotlight Search block the UI while it is searching for files? Don't they know they should always keep the UI alive in a separate thread so as to receive cancel requests and new key strokes even while a search is under way? Do we have to see the input box freeze for a few seconds while typing? If they can't do it properly, they should give up immediate search and only perform the search after the user hits enter, so as to keep the input box unfrozen at all times."
"They should know better. Never, ever block the UI while performing background computations. The user should always come first. In this day and age of reactive interfaces to make such a piece of crap UI is shameful.[Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/George_Santayana)"

"I've been trying to approve my devices for iCloud Keychain with a verification code for mmm... 2 years now? It still fails every time, with a generic error message or saying the code is invalid. And it pops up and reminds me to approve constantly."
"I've also replaced the guts of my macbook air with an upgraded logic board with double the ram and it still often acts like it has no ram at all.I turned my iCloud Keychain off, it turns itself back on and keeps asking me. It did it again half way through that sentence. So many of their core programs suck now. iTunes is absolutely the worst dog shit program ever. They ruined something that was so easy to use. Now I dont even know how to find anything. Stop fucking with your programs and go back to simple. Who the HELL is on the iTunes team, and why do they not know the first thing about making anything make any sense?"
"I haven't opened it in over a yearUpgrading to El Capitan destroyed my life... I want to cry.  Even the sodding name."
"Try Linux - bound to be a distro you can get on with.The best thing Apple ever made was the ipod ClassicI know this article is about software and not hardware, and that what I'm about to say is beside the point.  **But** ... As far as Apples hardware goes, I had the first two or three i-phones before switching to an Android, and I can honestly say that the biggest innovation that Apple has had since inventing the smart phone (which, don't get me wrong, was HUGE), was when they made it more like the Android, i.e. larger surface area and thinner with higher resolution.  Ever since inventing the smart phone, I feel like they've only been playing catch up with Android.  Even the highly acclaimed Apple watches came out a year or so after Samsung Gear, which no one seems to have noticed.  For some reason, everyone seems to think that Apple invented that technology.  At this point, I feel like there's no substantial difference between the i-phone and the Android, it's just a matter of personal difference.  And btw, is the peek function of the iPhone 6 taking the handheld world by storm like everyone predicted?I used to evangelize Apple products to friends and family, but I haven't done that for years now. "
"Their software has gotten awful, and iOS updates **deliberately** shorten the life of their hardware.I can't up vote this enough. Throw out all the core apps and start over. They are all complete crap now. I used to look forward to every update-now I dread them. I wish I had stayed on Mavericks. Yosemite was half baked. El Capitan doesn't sounds any better. I haven't updated to it. iTunes, Photos, Pages, etc...all....crapwear. Apple used to make the best apps on their OS. I don't see that any more. Everything is half baked. I know they can do better. I hope Cook lets them.They almost killed my phone 4s that could run for AT LEAST 2-3 more years with the iOS 9 update and they keep opressing me everyday to press the fucking 9.1 download button so I can discard my cellphone quicker and curse my phone with an even worse intentional rage-inducing lag"
"im out9.2 made my phone a lot faster, less buggy, and longer on a charge. 9.0/9.1 still felt like betas.I'm guessing you haven't tried 9.2 yet ...... runs faster than 8 on the 4S..."
"..... then again 9/9.1 ran faster than my stock nexus six (I have about 6 apps installed on it, heh)At least you have the option to update, 5 years after the phone was released. That's unheard of on the Android side. Yeah, the update notifications are annoying but if they didn't offer the update, people would be complaining that Apple was making their devices obsolete by not offering updates in the first place. please show me an android that was released in 2011 and still gets updated by the manifacturer and also runs well on the latest releaseThe point isn't that you can upgrade the handset, the issue is that you can't downgrade it once you reckon the lag is too much. It's pretty hilarious reading these complaints and fuckups by people who consider themselves tech savvy. iTunes is used by millions of people across the world. If it were seriously as terrible as everyone here is making it out to be, the situation would be a lot worse than all of you preaching to the choir. And to top it all off, you don't even need to use iTunes. You can use your iPhone completely independent of it. But since I'm a minority opinion here, I'll be downvoted so no one can see the one comment that actually makes sense. They fired Scott Forestal in 2012 and everything went to shit.A minor OSX update once messed up their own HP printer drivers (which took Apple ages to fix, with only a really bad workaround). Wasted 4 hours of my day at my parents for this. "
"That isn't as fun as the consistency of corruption they got in their iPhoto library though (which was fairly regular), or how in the new OSX they changed the way to attach images to an email (they made a separate button just for image attachments, which means that if you want to attach files instead, its now confusing). "
"The big problem IMHO though, is how Apple gained a lot of their market share. To this day, I have no idea why competitors didn't sue them for the Mac vs PC ads which suggested OSX couldn't get viruses (despite the fact OSX was commonly the first compromised target in hacking contests). I'm guessing Microsoft didn't because they probably profit a significant amount with MS Office for Mac, or still had Apple Shares, but they should have been for misleading advertising. "
"Back then, not a week went by when ProTool users weren't complaining that OSX updates broke protools either. I think people are simply becoming less forgiving of the issues these days. For me the music app on IOS stinks now. I'm so sad as I do use it constantly. At first I thought, its just me finding change hard but it really is a pile of shit. I feel like I'm stuck with it as I want it to sync with iTunes and my playlists.It's funny, I use very few of the stock Apple apps, but I'm in no way tempted by the Android side of things  (or windows phone, sorry MS, keep trying, your tablets are getting good). "
"The feel of my iPhone is fantastic, but more importantly, the best mobile software is consistently developed for the platform. (The Macbook hardware is just as good, though the app ecosystem is much more sparse on that side -- not sure I'd take my arguments too far on that side of things).  "
"The article critiques Apple apps mostly, not the foundational OS, or the hardware. The author, the other writers cited, and the 'public' aren't crazy here -- there does seem to be a problem. I tend to side with the idea that the release cycle is incompatible with solid software for them. "
"But the core OS is solid, and the hardware is fantastic. Mobile apps tend to be developed on at least iOS for a reason, and you can use a lot of that fantastic software in place of the stock apps. Very easy to do, >70% of the apps in the store are free, and the number is closer to 90% when you include freemium. The author seems to take it as a given that the only thing keeping users AND developers on the platform is the stock apps, which is insane. They're missing the reason people buy Apple products in the first place, and why the lack of 'it just works' in the software brings such a sense of disappointment to the customers. "
"The trapped in the ecosystem argument is bullshit too, but it's easy to make since it fits with the idea that Apple customers are mindless. You can't get to Apple's position by ripping people off or tricking them, and if you miss that in your analysis, you're going to get a lot of things about the company wrong. "
"Apple wouldn't be hurt by getting their shit together on the software side of things, but they'll probably have my money as long as the best 3rd part solutions are writing their software for the platform ( and I don't know a single company that's talking about STOPPING their iOS app, it's always just when it's right to get stared on Android) and as long as their hardware is exceptional. You never know though -- they've got a lot of goodwill built up over the years but any company can squander that.Wow, shit.  If anything, I think they are getting more usable for everything else."
"I'm in grad school right now and I haven't had to pay for Word, PowerPoint, or Excel.  I get by with Pages, Keynote, and Numbers just fine.  In fact, I get told that my presentations are awesome and beautiful."
"I really use Safari, Messages, Mail, and iTunes.  I don't understand the hatred for iTunes.  I like that I can remote sync my stuff over WiFi.  I like AirPlay screen sharing.  I like AirPlay to my speakers when I'm jamming.Product innovation has been replaced by innovative ways to overcharge customers. I thought you liked adapters."
"Yo, dawg, I heard you like adapters, so I made adapter for your adapters for your adapters. That'll be 150 bucks. Kthxbye asshole."
"-AppleThe biggest problem Apple has is Apple. It's like Pepsi or Coke. You have to drink the product. Give one Apple innovator a Samsung Galaxy, and he will see how MUCH BETTER it is over iPhone, that maybe he will make the iPhone better than that. Right now, after having both phones, the iPhone completely sucks balls. My iPhone 6 has the absolute worst copy/paste functionality, and I can't drop the cursor in the middle of the word for an edit. It either picks the left or right of the word. Like if I spell Newfoundland wrong, and I need to delete the d. I can't drop the cursor there. There are so many little things like this, I keep getting more frustrated with how bad it is. Plus all the apps, they are trying to own me with their shitty apps. Make a better app, sure, but the apps they force on me suck big balls. I can't read any more of this thread as I'm getting so fucking angry. I was such an apple fan, from the mid 90's until the last five years or so. I swear I'm gonna have PTSD from this thread.This article could be applied to *almost* any other company.I've disliked Apple ever since discovering in the late '80s their insatiable need to be different from Microsoft by having to press Ctrl and mouseclick to get right mousebutton features, and still not adressing this 30 years later by continuing to favor single-button mice in their product line."
"They are just not concerned with user experience, they want everyone to do things *their* way, and it saturates everything they do.I've said it a million times -- why the hell can't I drag and drop music files onto my phone in 2016? It was easier to transfer files to my goddamn Rio 500 than to my iPhone.It's been so, so painful to watch Apple change from a technology company to a fashion accessory, trendy company. "
"It's like they were waiting on Steve to buy the farm so they could finally work in peace on all the bullshit he shot down through the years."
"Unfortunately I work with software that only runs on Mac so I'm kinda bought in. Having a Hackintosh helps, though :)Once again, Linux is in position to pounce.  With Windows 10 problems and the Apple issues, if there were a couple Linux distributions to get behind, they'd be tough to beat.Unfortunately desktop Linux interest 1/10 of what it was in 2003 or so.People have been saying that about Linux for decades now. The problem Linux still has to overcome is fragmentation and end user support. There's too many cooks in the kitchen doing their own thing (see android for example and setting up exchange email on one versus another compared to iPhone). And since  company backed support with Linux for the average home end user is non-existent, people aren't going to switch to it in droves."
"Sure there are message boards, but are you really going to expect your parents/grandparents to know what to type into google and understand what they are being told to do? Googling is a skill in and of itself let alone using an OS that you are not familiar with."
"Linux's place in the market would be for those who only know how to click on the Firefox logo or open office suit. Outside of that, the average end user is going to be completely lost because Windows and OSX hold your hand for you."
"Also Ubuntu out of the box at least to me is pretty ugly. Mint looks a ton better. But part of the draw to OSX is the look out of the box. With windows, it familiarity. "
"Also you need to account for things like with what happened with flash on linux. Adobe stopped making it for Linux. Sure we should all be moving to html5, but we should also be doing a lot of other things as well. Point is, in my experience, at least in the enterprise world, you are on your own unless you know where to look.Relatively speaking I've seen a lot less issues with 10 than I have past releases. The few times I've had to support it it's been due to Nvidia mucking up drivers or some strange Bluetooth things. "
"Linux, although better every day, and being a Kali user, I still wouldn't ask my parents or grand parents to run it.Pounce?  "
"Linux is more likely to stumble into the room, look around bewildered because it forgot what it went in there for in the first place, then leave. "
"There ain't no pouncing going to be done by Linux. Apple has always been a shitty overpriced brand, dont know why people keep on buying it. IdiotsI will be downvoted for this. I don't care. I really hope this is a sign that this 15 year Apple fad is finally starting to die. Apple software has always sucked.Two weeks ago, after repeated complaints and confusion from my girlfriend, I installed Windows on her 13 Macbook Pro Retina.  She loves the computer, but OSX was destroying her soul.  She really was Apple's target customer, but after really trying to love their stuff, she just couldn't do it anymore.  BTW, it runs Windows really well.  Nicer than any Dell.I'm platform agnostic - I just want stuff that works. Since Snow Leopard, everything Apple are vomiting out into the marketplace sucks a hairy dick. And best of all? The cunts don't even fucking acknowledge the plight of tens of fucking thousands of people on their own fucking Apple forums?! Case in point? Sure thing - ask them about the wifi dropouts that plagued people since fucking ever after snow leopard - yeah that's right - it ended up being the dumb cunts updating some part of the network stack and it not working. But no - rather than fess up, they did their usual Apple aloof act. "
"Cunts."
"Take a look at the Microsoft Surface Book if you're a MacBook Air user. I did and I'm sold. Pisses on design, build quality, features AND WARRANTY in every. single. way."
"But keep on pushing out those smartwatches fellas - coz THAT is going to keep your Enterprise customers happy right? Oh wait.. You ditched OSX Server in favour of developing cool watch bands - I forgot."
"We've reached peak apple. They're failing now. Their new building is a traditional sign that a company is about to implode. Once consumer trust is blown, and even their ardent supporters are now saying fuck you, you know Apple is going down the shitter."
"TL;DR - Apple are cunts and we've reached peak Apple.iTunes - it used to be so simple and intuitive then they over thought it and tried too hard to be clever. Their UI testing team should have several geriatrics in it. Less focus on pretty and more focus on usability/intuitivenessiTunes isn't even their biggest fuck up. Just look at the outrage from the pro-editing community when they upgraded Final Cut Pro X. They switched from the more power user friendly style of multi-track editing, hotkeys and precision scrubbing, to some weird iMovie hybrid that has one continuous timeline, no multitrack, and a magnetic snapping feature.Bad launch (in 2011) aside, FCPX does what OP's article wants all of Apple's software to do - it just works. It's a different kind of NLE than what multi-track editors are used to, but the product isn't a fuck up. [One of the most widely-circulated videos](https://vimeo.com/108018156) on /r/filmmaking and related subs last year was cut on X, and the editing is what had everyone excited. If you're an editor, give it a try - you can disable the magnetic timeline at any point (but you'll probably come to appreciate it); you can create tracks where they're needed; and it has enough hotkeys that Premiere and Resolve now have options for users to import FCPX shortcuts.Final Cut Pro X is great, though."
"At least on El Capitan. Are we coming to that point where Microsoft and Apple swaps places? Because that is crazy but I don't think impossible.hm. Blogs full of hate for mac. Blogs full of hate for windows. I think people are just fucking stupid. Some things addressed in this thread:"
"Why pay all that money for a mac, everybody always asks? Macs come with amazing hardware. I think the hardware is worth every last dime. I have a $1000 dollar PC, and a $1000 dollar MBA. The MBA takes the cake every time, regardless of operating system."
"The trackpads are amazing. I never knew I could get so much joy out of using a trackpad."
"My 2014 Macbook Air is amazing. It runs OSX yosemite great, windows 10 great, and linux great. "
"iPhones are terrible. We can all agree on this. Stop buying iPhones. Now you don't have to live in the shitty little ecosystem they built for themselves. Problem solved. "
"Macs are great for graphic design, Chrome, and music production. If you're not doing those things go somewhere else."
"Android is amazing. You can do anything you want with it. Computers in general are amazing. You can do anything you want with them. And I mean anything. Learn to use Google, Morty. Break the cycle. "
"As a software developer, everyone will always complain about your software all the time. No matter what."
"I used to be a mac hate. I now understand why they're great. "
"JUST STOP FUCKING BUYING IPHONES. VOTE WITH YOUR WALLET. "
"Here's how to make your technology work for you:"
"* Use your macbook for on the go. They're small, they're fast, they're dependable. As I said also good for Design and Music, and browsing the web. "
"* Use you android as your main phone. Don't cheap out. Get a really nice one. They are 100% worth it. Any issues you find with android can be solved with a simple google search, and you're pretty much only restricted by your imagination. "
"* Use your PC as your main bitch and use Windows for playing games."
"All problems are now solved."
"I will never again participate or read any debates over company X VS company Y. Make your technology work for you and stop buying into the hype. "

"And as a side note: can someone please explain why anyone would ever use a third party app to manage their gmail account? Why would anyone ever write software to manage emails? Just goto gmail.com wtf people. Plugins for anything you could ever want. No one is arguing the quality of the hardware.  But macs are shipping with more than just bugs.  Some core software flat out does not work."
"I cannot use Mail on my mac because it refuses to connect properly with my server.  Itunes is broken and unusable, safari is beyond primitive.Have been buying macs for a few decades at least now, and I have to say that although Tim Cook seems like a good guy, at least design-wise apple is really missing Steve Job's judgement."
"That said, apple will have to work a lot harder if they want to look as bad as Windows.Enjoy that form over function.You just implied that Windows had more functionality than OSX.... a Unix based OS. Have you tried piping to SSH in Windows? What do you want to pipe to SSH?  Do you want to pipe it to a Windows based SSH client or a cmd line based SSH client?  You can have either, or you can use the powershell scripting language to do all that and more, including the package manager built into the new Windows.  "
"Oh you just want a Unix style shell?  Sure we got hundreds of them, what kind do you want?  By the way, you're in a Unix based OS right?  Go ahead and recompile your kernel.  Or just replace your default shell with csh or ksh.  "
"Oh you can't really do any of that can you.  It's almost like you're in a bullshit Unix hack OS..  Hmm..  "
"Tim Cook is a piece of shit who is damaging the company, unlike Satya who is helping MS.  Apple needs a better CEO.wow amazing that anyone would be paying attention to this lazy article. Walt Mossberg was already late to this complain-train party 2 weeks ago, but this guy just copies Walt's article....Will there be a day where that creepy group of Apple users will stop defending them no matter what happens? There are not groups like this for any other company.  When Samsung fucks up, I say it. I still love the phone.  But until they go back to a removable SD card and battery they can go fuck themselves. Those people exist for Google/Android and Microsoft/Windows too. I've been subbed to /r/android and /r/windowsphone. It's as much evangelism and criticism as the Apple subreddits.I've seen much Nexus Is The Perfect Phone on that subreddit. I just really want an SD slot and a removable battery.Get an LG V10. Your getting down voted but you speak the truth. Fuck Samsung for getting rid of the SD card and removable battery.> There are not groups like this for any other company."
"Apple may have the most ardent fans, but it happens with other companies as well. Just look at videogame companies. If you get invested in a particular console or publisher, you'll tend to look past their faults.> Will there be a day where that creepy group of Apple users will stop defending them no matter what happens?"
"You must not frequent /r/apple, then.  While full of many self-professed Apple enthusiasts, it's also full of people who won't hesitate to criticize Apple at the drop of a hat *because* they're self-professed Apple enthusiasts.I love iCloud Photo Library and Safari rivals Chrome, but I just wish iOS Mail supported push Gmail...No joke, Safari crashed when I clicked to open these comments. (It's been crashing a lot in El Capitan... haven't figured out why yet, used to be pretty darn solid.)Could be your memory going out. Bad memory can cause a lot of weird crashing issues. More likely this: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7261705?start=0&tstart=0Strange bug, but could also be related to memory management. I've always hated IOS. OSX sucks because Apple has been slowly restricting the modifications you can make to your own device."
"Maybe I'll use Antergos in the future...My main gripes are with Photos and iTunes/Apple Music. Such horrible limited or obscured UIs. Without forgetting iCloud calendar.  Seriously considering if I ditch the iPhone and rMBP for Android and Windows when it comes time to replace. As an Apple Fan, I wish they never made a phone and focused on computers. Getting rid of secure erase was dumb, too. Switched from my MB Air about a year and a half ago now. Just couldn't deal with it anymore. The nail in the coffin was trying to dual boot to Linux and not working. The computer wouldn't wake from sleep correctly, the screen would pixelate at weird times. I spent weeks working with customer care before they finally just told me dual boot wouldn't be an option."
"Each upgrade made the computer worse. Customization is severely limited (especially for what is touted as open source). I finally caved and switched to the SP3. At least with MS, I know to expect what I get.I'm late to the party, but how has nobody mentioned Final Cut Pro 7. It was great, everyone loved it, and then they released Final Cut Pro X, and shit hit the fan. Now Adobe has taken over with Avid, Blackmagic and others fighting for market share too. They're learning[deleted]> 2012's Snow Leopard"
"You either want: 2009's if referring to SL, or Mountain Lion if referring to the thing released in 2012.The new disk utility seems especially crippled as well, leaving most of its functions to terminal commands. They have always, in my opinion, have had good hardware.  the pc software sucks."
"It is hard for me to leave since I do have apps that I use on a regular basis and I don't want to buy them again for android....  but I am starting to consider it.The only big problems I see are with iTunes ever since Apple Music was released. It's not exactly buggy, it is just a bad user interface. So I cancelled my Apple Music subscription and restarted Spotify. Now iTunes is just there for music I own, Spotify is for the rest.So they've arrived at the point BYoD admins started at.My NAS has mp3fs so iTunes sees all my flacs and other high quality audio formats as mp3s, iTunes syncs the selected 'fake mp3' music from my mp3fs which is pointed to my real nas music folder and then syncs them to my phone (but my server is just live converting to MP3 behind the scenes) "
"That's how I got my phone to not bother me about my formats [etc] in iTunes."
"My iPhone plays the music, and my phone can dial/sms people. That's all I need it for right now. "
"Plex and Owncloud have external protected access enabled so if there's any new music I haven't synced on I just stream it from my place to wherever the phone and I are. Or movies I guess. It doesn't matter how 'amazing' the hardware is if the software can't keep up. Good thing their marketing us better than both. (And the hardware is obviously pretty good.)I've owned every single iPhone since the iPhone 2, but the 6S will most likely be my last.  It actually does have to do with the quality of Apple's internal apps, but not one mentioned in this article:"
"iOS Update.  I liked it better when you never got notices about it.  Now, it notifies you and doesn't stop annoying you until you finally upgrade.  I will never buy another iPhone if this ridiculousness isn't removed.I own one Apple product - an iPad. It will be my last Apple product.Yeah, but Steve Jobs was a dick. Derp!I don't think its anything new that people don't like their software and services but like their hardwareAs some one who Owen a ipad but then bought a shield 3 mouths later.  The software has gone down hill rember the original home screen be for they updated  it was professional now it looks childish,  make me look at any realy cheap android tablet/phone be for bying a PS400 tablet that is locked down so much that you carnt change the icons to look direct Can someone tell me what's wrong with iTunes? ELI5, please. It's doing everything I need it to do. What should it be doing that it isn't and I should care about? "
"I do want a simpler and straightforward way of taking my pics and vids out of my iPhone and iPad but can never do so. "
"I also want to delete pics and vids from my phone and iPad without it deleting from iCloud but nooooooooooo. Sexytime pics don't need to be on my phone all the time. It's a very large bloated program at this point, moreso if you are a windows user. "
"IMO iTunes is fine for OSX. I've only ever owned iPods, and all in all they've been good to me.    Otherwise, I've always considered the brand gimmicky, over priced, under powered, and generally pretty ugly.  It's just my opinion, but there has pretty much always been a better alternative to any apple product I considered buying.  iTunes has been getting steadily worse since forever, to the point where I actually hate installing it on my computer to put more music on my iPod.I had all of their products for years. switching away from their crap, completely sick of itI bought an Macpro 3 years ago .. For one reason garage band and the rest of the apps or stuff on it ... Don't really use it.... I surf in my other PC!the software is far more stable, its just more people using it and therefore finding more bugs. Pretty sure Apple software has been in decline since System 7.  So this is kind of old news."
"They did get very good at making good hardware products, but the software has never been very good since way back when."
"I got rid of all my last Apple product 5 years ago, and I'm sure glad that I made that decision. "
"Over-priced and over-rated."
"The iPod is the only product Apple ever made that I absolutely adore, its too bad that it was phased out, and its too bad that iTunes had to ruin the experience. My iPod still works great, and I actually like iTunes... But I'd never buy any other products from them! The weird thing is that I have an iPhone 6 running iOS 9.0.2 and a Macbook Pro 15in 2011 with El Capitan. I have no quarrels with the software, especially iTunes. I am not saying I love them either, but just because I do not use, for example, Notes, doesn't mean I hate it. I don't use Windows. Does it mean I hate it? No. I just do not prefer it. "
"That said, some of the hardware is stupid. Has anyone seen the new MightyMouse or their new comedic iPhone case? Well Apple software on windows was never great, but it was always good on Macs... it's starrrrrttttttting to go south. I blame Tim and Jony, they've gone mad with power.OpenGL in El Capitan is pretty much rubbish.  I can understand why it's not likely a priority with Apple since practically nobody uses their hardware professionally outside of video and two-dimensional applications.  Still, it's frustrating that if you wanted to or, as I currently do, need to, that you get the one-two punch of AMD which has dodgy drivers on every platform and then Apple's lack of experience or possibly interest in professional 3D."
"My only complaint with my iPhone6s is that since running the very first IOS update its iPod functionality with my car's headunit has been completely inconsistent and dodgy and half the time seemingly broken.The 5S was the first iphone I got when it first came out. I miss being able to use my phone to pretty much do everything a pc does. And just plug an usb into it and manage all its storage. And make hotspots. I used Windows until 7/8 released, then converted to apple and now I'm back with win 10. "
"In my opinion, Apple did have the edge but they have built the os too much like iOS and lost a lot of functionality by favouring ease of use. I've been using Preview daily since 2010 across 2 Macbook Pros and 2 iMacs, from Snow Leopard up through El Capitan, and it has not crashed once for me. I hate imessage. Why? Because it's slow here, and especially when you're sending images from camera roll. They seem to send the high quality, so it takes longggg to get them sent. Yup, I'm not a fanboy either way, just bloody thankful I jumped to android last year. By the end iTunes managed to piss me off just by opening it. I hated iTunes so much I switched to Android when the note 2 came out. I am back to Apple now but now use Spotify and never open iTunes. I also never transfer media to my phone so it's all streaming or cloud. I fly a lot but I just read during flights instead of listening to music or watching movies.I've dreaded iTunes for years. What's new?Just came here to say fuck the music app. The show all files in Finder is about my breaking point with Mavericks. who would have thought that all it took to get fans to hate Apple would be years of mistreatment and bad products?Apple Music and iTunes Match collectively destroyed my iTunes library so moved completely to Spotify. Photos on Mac is a disaster and Preview crashes whenever it loads a document over 100 pages for me.My last phone was an iPhone 4s that I loved until the one update that slowed it to a turtles pace. I was sure they did it so people like me would upgrade to a newer device so I bought a galaxy s6 about a year ago and vowed to never buy a apple product again. But one big thing apple phones did that galaxy doesn't is have a great touch screen. Somehow the 4s always seemed to know when my finger was pressing it. With the galaxy s6 everything can press the screen, from falling on my stomach to a metal keyring or my headphone cable. That in itself has made me nearly switch back to the iPhone but they seem to be slipping as a company since Jobs passed and the damn update still pisses me off. Apple user for 10+ years now on android. I have heard that many people say Apple products are for very creative people. I disagree, I would rather say it was developed by the creative guys initially who lost track of where they were heading. "
"Overpriced: Is this phone is for wealthy ? We have several competitors (ex: Mi) who are able to design and cough up an Android phone, well tested providing better h/w specs and features at lowered price ? Its no longer new technology to be priced. So basically what you pay is not what you get as off today!"
"Experiment for you to try: Login to Skype or hangouts in an apple device and on android device. Ask someone to call you, nheot a single time do I get a call on iPhone/iPad .... Note notifications are turned on both devices. "
"Adaptors/accessories: Why don't the make standards compatible hardware ? Lightning cable huh? "
"iTunes: Not really transparent or user friendly."
"These are not the only reasons, I could come up with a list of hundred others if I had sufficient time to do this today."
"Maybe if they open source their iOS / MAC OS code and lower the costs, it may be a game changer for them.iTunes? Haves you seen Logic Audio? I'm a musician / producer and sometimes I have to use Logic because my clients work with that. How could they mess it up so much is beyond me. Very powerful piece of software that looks and feels like a Fischer Price toy with those ugly big colours and faux cutting edge UI. A piece of software that has to hold your hand every step of the way and effectively get in the way of creative workflow. They basically took a magnificent DAW and regressed it to a glorified instance of Garage Band. WHY?As someone with decades of experience and a lifelong Apple nerd.I've had ever iPhone since they came out and a few iPads. It's still magic to me when my photos share between devices. I think the software is cool. I might be a casual but I'd guess 90% other users are the same as me. "
"Windows vista on my horrible laptop turned me to apple many years ago. I had all of them. The imac, iphone, ipod, ipad, macbook pro. The restraints, the apps and updates getting hungrier and hungrier and the lack of innovation turned my away. "
"The breaking point was when they stopped all my chargers working because they werent official apple chargers and filled my phone with so many updates that I couldnt fit music and the phone software together."
"Couldnt be happier with my samsung phone and my surface pro 3. Freedom and the ability to do what I want with my devices is huge. When my iPod dies and my wife buys me a new one and I can't sync up to iTunes because it needs to be updated. Fuck that. I went to update it and it said the OS needed to be updated, I went to update the OS and the computer couldn't handle the newest update. My entire library was on that computer at the time.I agreed with Mossbergs report.  App,e software has become less reliable and more buggy.  The real turd is the Apple Watch OS.  Everytime a Watch App updates it never works properly.  The icon doesn't fill in or the app just plain doesn't work on the phone.  So I have go in and uninstall and reinstall every Watch app manually.  The real Apple shitshow is Xcode. Apple is the only company that makes you fear its updates.I loved the on-the-go playlist feature, it's a shame they killed it.Why don't people use a third party software instead of iTunes? Just scrolled through a ton of complaints about iTunes but people can just use programs like itools, it's just drag and drop. I use it for my ipod touch 1g on 4.1.2 and my iPhone 4s on 9.2..  Unless they purchase music though iTunes? But even then you can just copy them from the iTunes folder? I Moved from a HTC One M8 to an iphone 6s, the software was much more stable to begin with, having more issues now some times touch ID does werid things or fires up the passcode screen then gets stuck there for a while, last night i was playing a game and the screen just became entirely unresponcive to input. "
"The other day Siri wouldnt Hear me it was like the mic was turned off."
"All this is normally sorted with a reboot Password missing - I have not been able to use mail properly as it keeps screwing up. It absolutely was a disaster back in like 2006 I had original iPods, and the update process.My biggest gripe with Apple right now is that since iOS 9 you aren't allowed to sync apps from your Iwhatever to your computer. it's because several bugs and freezes that people complain over and over again and they never get solved.Even working out which of my podcasts is downloaded and which is synced to my iPod is a massive pain in the ass. Looking for a decent android mp3 player.I updated my iTunes to work with my new iPhone, and the app store stopped working. The Genius Bar couldn't fix it without a full reinstall. I couldn't update at all without completely and manually moving all of my stuff. "
"That wasn't the dealbreaker. Yet. I let it sit for quite a while."
"When the time came that work required I downloaded Powerpoint, I couldn't install it on my stuck outdated operating system. "
"My solution: get Windows. "
"Granted I'd used Windows a bit before, like a crappy gaming rig my aunt gave me and some work through my school, but I'd been using Apple since OS9 and had the original iPod. I was a self-identified Apple user. "
"Was.I think I'm going to buy one last iPod touch when I can afford one - and that's it. I'm out of the game. I can't afford to keep on repairing devices that break because of faulty charging ports, etc, or worry about my devices being obsoleted by mandatory updates. And yeah, iTunes never really worked properly for me and still doesn't display all my apps.I don't see what everyone is complaining about. They took their great minds and created a new software......known as Apple pencil. "
"This was the moment I lost a lot of respect for them. "
"They have lost focus. Jobs focus was to bring great products. Now it's all about bottom line and how much of something they sold. As much hate Jobs got, he had shit locked down at Apple design wise. Like the fucking apple pencil charging position would never have made it past him.I am a regular user of iTunes and really can't complain at all. Can someone explain what the issues *specifically* are with it?"
"I am a podcast producer and find it fine to browse and listen to episodes, I like the feature they introduced that automatically deletes episodes that are listened to so they don't clog up space. It could handle episode artwork a little better (i.e. if none specified, default to the podcast artwork rather than the grey placeholder) but I have no other complaints."
"For listening to music, I love the album view, it's bright and colourful and I love the up next feature to queue up a track without interrupting the playback of an album. I subscribe to iTunes Match which syncs all my music not bought from iTunes with free store purchases in the music store, that seems to work fine although it doesn't give me much feedback the music has successfully been matched. Again, apart from that I'm happy."
"The app is always responsive on my 2015 Mac Book Pro 15 Retina. Are the issues referring to the Windows version? I'm completely at a loss as to what people's complaints are!Android Raster Race.It's really a joke that Apple even tries to defend this. Dealing with the fact their newest iOS can't even mark all emails as read without babysitting it is beyond pathetic for any one of the many very talented programmers that work for Apple. They have been quite a disorganized company for quite a while now, and it doesn't seem to be getting better anytime soon. iTunes is the reason why I ditched my iPhone 4. I quite liked the phone itself, but absolutely hated the reliance on iTunes and AppleID."
"It's ok though, I'm locked out of my own iPhone 4 because it asks me for my AppleID and then tells me I'm using the wrong one. lolwut.iTunes was always absolute garbage. I had one of the first iPods, iTunes is why I never bought another piece of Apple hardware again.Apple people finally starting to pick up on things many of us saw years ago."
"IMO the biggest trick apple played on people was creating an environment where you needed to be an apple person with all your devices being made from them.  I've seen several friends IRL who WANT to move to Android but feel they can't because the rest of their devices are Apple and won't play nice.  I'm basically stuck now.  "
"Granted not everyone wants to build their own PC or have a phone that is totally open and customizable, some people need it to just work^(tm).  But one you get anchored into software like iTunes that seeks to dictate your content across all devices... bad times lie ahead.Apple needs to adopt a rule for their development teams: Any software that isn't core needs to be able to be turned off or swapped out for 3rd party apps. Icon deleted, uninstalled, no nags or special offers."
"This would keep them honest. iTunes might actually improve if it had to earn its way instead of being a default. Safari is their best bundled Mac app and it's no accident it is also the most easily avoided.This is hardly new. Anybody remember FTFF?"
"It took them three full versions until Aperture was absolutely top notch only to lose interest two years later and have it killed and replaced by a tool that is barely on par with freeware apps out there. I needed to replace my MacBook which is about 8 years old. So I started doing research on Laptops and ended up buying a Dell. Mac OS is a great operating system but I am not going to spend 1500-3000 on an Apple laptop that I am never going to be able to update the hardware.At this point I don't even *consider* upgrading my OS X to the newest version until at least 6 months after release, and often simply won't upgrade it at all unless a piece of software demands it, despite the free price tag. It can take forever for them to finally get a release working, whether it's OS X, iOS, or a regular piece of software, and the mantra with Apple software has quickly become don't upgrade unless you really need to. My current apple product. (Iphone 6) is my last apple product. The reason I always liked my iphone was because it was intuitive and always worked. Now I have constant problems with reliability and ease of use. Say, does anybody know how to (easily) change the names of mp3s in iTunes back to title/artist from the 4 character code that iTunes changes it to? I hate iTunes and I want to change media players."
"What's with all the iTunes hate? Ok syncing can suck and all but as just a music player I actually really like it.Paging John Hodgman...Don't have to answer to Steve= Quality suffers."
"The Cook is too happy.My mom gave me her 2011 Macbook Air. I wanted a break from Windows and thought this would be a nice stepping stone into the Unix world. Then the Air bricked itself during the upgrade to El Capitan. Now it's sitting on the floor gathering dust. Apparently, I have to reformat the entire drive, install the OS from a CD and re-install all of my software again. I can do that with Windows just fine.That and there are some major oversights these days, it seems. Take iCloud Photo Library for instance. Such promise, but limited in so many stupid ways. First, I have to sign in to the same iCloud account on all devices - no family sharing for photo libraries (or iTunes match for that matter). And then, everything syncs across devices *except face tagging*. Which is the one thing we really want to be able to casually do and synchronise. It seems to me that Apple have lost their eye for detail, certainly, over the last little while.The only Apple product I own is a Macbook. Even that I didn't buy, I won."
"I like the hardware, it's sleek and performs pretty well, but dang do I fucking hate the software!"
"I actually won one of almost every apple device at a point about 5 years ago, Ipod, Ipad, Macbook, AppleTV, Iphone etc."
"Telling that the Macbook is the only one i kept.Couldn't agree more. Im on my 2nd iPhone and it will be my last. Well, I only use itunes because of the ability to see all of the ablum covers well, but it's soooo slow and clunky. What's the best alternative for use with an ipod classic then?There are a number of iTunes replacements are there not? "
"I used one by Mozilla a few years ago, it was good. You still use this sort of thing?I don't dare update iOS anymore.  My iPod 4 has become slow and very subpar online.  I avoid iTunes like the plague, and getting files from it to my windows computer is much too difficult. I'm hating iOS with every update, if it wasn't for Jailbreak and a game I've been following for four years I would've jumped ship a long time ago.TSTO?What?HS:HoWC?Safari can't open the page... What? WTF, this is every second link tap on my iPad GODDAMNFUCKINGSAFARIHBGFCDFFGBBAAAAAAAAAA!!!!Used Macs from 2007 through 2012 or so as my primary computer. And iPhones pretty consistently, from 07 to present."
"You guys aren't digging nearly hard enough at the software failures of Apple. The merging of experience between OS X and iOS is when I knew they completely threw in the towel of giving a shit about software, but the trend started earlier:"
"Did anyone use Aperture? Or Aperture 2? Pretty great pieces of software. Aperture was awesome and worked quite well. Then they just gave up and stopped. No more aperture. "
"How about Final Cut? Any serious video editors that used to use Final Cut Pro? Does anyone remember the fiasco of Final Cut X? A whole industry refused to upgrade because the next version was ridiculously unintuitive, highly backwards incompatible, and generally: shit. I know of a few editing houses that continue to use Final Cut Pro on some older OS X versions because some several-thousand-dollar professional plugins they rely on  won't work with the new version. "
"Killing off their pro creative software was when I started to realize their software was becoming an afterthought. "
"Then when they started to care about OS X so little that they just started to make it mirror iPhone concepts, they really gave up. It seemed like half of the reason was UX-y shared, unified experiences across devices but the other half was fuck it, write it once for both operating systems. Macs don't make us enough money to deserve the attention nowApple is turning into the McDonald's of technology. It's easy to get, works right out of the box, but doesn't do anything well enough to do any good for anyone in the long run. If Apple doesn't get their shit together with the iPhone 7 and the new iOS, I will be switching back to PC and Android with a quickness that knows no bounds.I honestly do not understand the issues with iTunes, I've never had any major issues with it whatsoever since being on a Mac. Also, Apples major problem is that they rush out software too fast. They have to release new products every year at the same time.. knowing the quality isn't where it needs to be. It's sad that it takes until a .2 update now, to have actual stable software. Mom bought an Iphone, day one connected it to laptop, transferred files."
"Day 2, connected to PC, can only transfer files after wiping iPhone, WTF?Sounds about right to meI have apple stuff. Heck, I admit I mostly buy apple stuff! Apple still has a certain kind of magic for me but it's wearing thin. The biggest plus for apple used to be the consistent user experience across all apple software and, for basic operations, even across third party software."
"I give them a little slack in that user interface design has become a nightmare, what with the myriad of exciting new interaction hardware available? from mouse to touch to voice? and all this on a myriad different hand tools, from keyboard to touch pad to mouse with touch pad to full direct manipulation on a phone or tablet?"
"Still... if it's so difficult to consolidate a good experience on all these devices then why the heck are they also focusing on cars?Fire the whole department . Keeping iTunes like that for ages is just a sign of throughout incompetency Apple absolutely ruined Itunes.I've been an OSX user for the last 6 years. I chose apple as my main platform because Windows majorly sucked (say what you will, but win7 is not a pinnacle of design or user experience) and there were no Linux laptops that had 8 years of battery life. I still think that Linux is one OS where there was no progress regarding battery life at all. And I think Apple hardware is awesome. They sell you awesomely engineered hardware and provide great service for it (example - I had 5 dead pixels on retina macbook purchased in the USA, apple reseller in Belgium got me a new screen in 4 days no questions asked, try that with Asus)."
"I worked with all OSX versions since 10.5 and I think Apple really don't understand what they are doing. Who are they going to cater on desktop - so-called Pro Users (which is a fancy term for <<Small businesses and enterprise>>) or home users who are using only web browser? Because with all these features they removing (root for example or botching down iWork suite) they surely will lose all Pro-customers. And even web browsing experience is not that great. I have Win10 installed on my mac and MS Edge is so much more faster in terms of rendering and FPS while scrolling."
"I had an iPhone and the best thing there is the app support. I mean developers put their soul in the App Store. But the hardware is mediocre at best, battery life is shitty, screen is low-res etc."
"I really hope they will get their shit together, at least with desktop OS. "
"Edit: wordMy demands of my iPhone aren't that crazy. All I want to be able to do is delete programs like Apple Watch. Or the Apple weather app. Or all of the many programs that are now in my Useless folder on my phone."
"Why can't I do that?I recently took the plunge and got an iPad mini."
"It's some sweet hardware to be sure, but the software sucks."
"Clunky keyboard. I'm forever guessing at gestures. Copy and paste, never seems to select what I want. These are basics right?"
"Regret.I love Apple but I've noticed more issues over the past year or so. Simple glitches that never get fixed. Why can't we write on photographs within iOS Notes? Why isn't there automatic spell correct within the Notes section of OS X Contacts? Why don't Contacts and Reminders work better together? Why do phone numbers and links sometimes highlight for easy clicking in Reminders but sometimes do not? Why, when adding a new Group in OS X Contacts, does the highlighted input field usually crash upon the first attempt but not the second attempt? So many niggling issues.Not that I disagree but I need to point out that you're pointing out desired features, not glitches. Big difference.There's a mix in there.The interface on Apple Music is appallingAnd you'll see why 1984 won't be like 1984Well it's hard to make software shiny. I despise iTunes so much I uninstalled it from my Mac. Not an easy task considering how integrated it is into the Apple ecosystem.I generally prefer Apple products over their competitors. Have had several Android phones and several iPhones, definitely prefer the iPhone. Have had many PCs and Apple computers, definitely prefer the Apple computers."
"But they have definitely gone downhill. Like WHY DOES ALL MY MUSIC KEEP RANDOMLY DISAPPEARING OFF OF MY IPHONE? I'm sure I can figure out the problem and fix it (good 'ol google to the rescue), but the point is that I shouldn't HAVE to be googling around to figure out why the fuck my music won't stay on my phone when it worked fine in the several iPhones I've had for the last 4 or 5 years. They took away the ability to sync Notes when plugged directly into a laptop. You have to use iCloud or email them individually now. I *love* Apple products, generally speaking - and that simple fact will probably get me down voted :P"
"But iTunes is the biggest piece of shit software I have encountered on the Mac. Where most of OS/X just does what I want it to do when I want to do it - enough that I don't even need to check a manual for most things - iTunes is a constant frustration. Its seemingly core to so many activities, in so many ways, and yet its primary function seems to be to *prevent* me from doing what I want with my stuff. This is where Apple is falling on its face in my opinion."
"My only other criticisms that I can think of, off hand, is that Apple Maps doesn't seem to cache anything on my iPhone so it eats too much data to be using on a regular basis. Perhaps its me and someone will have a solution, but it would be a major improvement if it would just cache all the map data for say a 50 mile radius and updated it once every 6 months or so. Just street names and addresses, I don't give a damn about businesses."
"Also Preview. It used to be on my desktop that when I hit the space bar it opened up the file in Preview, as far as I can recall. N ow it opens it up in *something else* which has a Preview option. This is just annoying for no apparent reason.death of apple ect ect good riddancefor me, iTunes had this one function ages ago that I LOVED. it would create a random playlist of 25 songs from my entire music collection (which has always been large because I used to rip entire music archives from my friends and family) and would shuffle a new list after it was finished. I created some of my favourite playlists from that function, and when you have a music archive that was over 60gb, it was amazing."
"annnnd then they forced me to update iTunes when I got an iPhone and they had removed the function and replaced it with 'genesis' - which really only works if you bought all your music from iTunes and didn't rip the entire music archive from your high schools server in 2005. My music collection is now over 130gb now, and I don't know what to use to handle it, other than the horror and monstrosity that is iTunes. Am I the only one here who hasn't experienced any of the problems everyone is citing? iTunes? I open up iTunes literally once every 2-3 years when I upgrade my iPhone. I back up over iCloud in the time between. I listen to music all day long, but I use Google Music (RIP, Rdio) which you can also upload your own music to if you want. I've never had an issue with Apple software with either an iPhone 4s, 6, or a Macbook. Everything's worked great. People hate on iTunes a lot, at least on Macs its awesome, on my PC I haven't had an issue with it but I don't use that nearly as much.Not gonna lie, this is music to my ears. I do own a iPhone 5s and Galaxy S5, but the iPhone is for work only. I couldn't imagine if I used it to the extent of my S5...I'm sure I'd be having slowdown issues.xcode is literal devil's spawn.We are?So now Apple has overpriced hardware and bad software... what's the argument for getting their products again? The hardware is fucking gorgeous."
"But that's the only reason.Steve Jobs wouldn't have allowed it to get this bad. His medical literacy may have been kooky, but he still would have screamed at someone stupid enough to think that bloating people with useless updates was a good idea.Software aside how about their $400 Apple Watch that breaks easily from daily use and then they want $225 to replace said screen.As a tech guy I repeatedly find OSX/IOS harder to use than Windows/Android. In the process of trying to simplify things they actually make them harder and infuriating. I dread ever having to copy music to my moms phone, iTunes makes it so incredibly difficult.Maybe that's just in an attempt to discourage piracy.  (tongue in cheek)Sometimes I wish I could just sit down with someone high up to in Apple's software development team and explain that they need to refocus attention on functionality and redundancy."
"Functionality is a matter of attention to detail, including providing for both simple, low complexity, commonly-needed uses and specialized, seldom needed, but product-defining uses. Apple appears to have heavily weighted the former and whittled away at the latter. Perhaps it is an effort to streamline user-support and try to deal with the mass-use case. Which unfortunately means it's just a matter of time before everybody will run into the lack of support for obvious but non-common tasks at some point, making the products seem like they are toys, not ready for prime-time use."
"An example of this kind of behavior (there are many) is the removal of Reveal in Finder support in iTunes and Photos. In an effort to prevent users gaining access to the raw data they own (I suspect because they might accidentally move something), the user is stuck with an unnecessary and time consuming export process. A less trivial example is the lack of ability to fix a corrupted Time Capsule backup. It appears to be just a matter of time before a Time Capsule backup fails its monthly validation test. The only official recovery option is to throw the entire backup away (potentially years of history) and start from scratch. Sure one should have more than one backup mechanism in play but the catastrophic failure window is widened by this lack and that reflects directly on the OS."
"Redundancy is a matter of providing several equivalent mechanisms to perform the same task, allowing the user to develop a style of use and provides for enthusiastic transfer of technique from one user to another (buzz)."
"An example of the loss of redundancy would be the removal of the press-and-hold to pop-up a copy control in iOS Photos. The feature has recently been hidden under a sharing icon. Why not allow both mechanisms? Again, there are many such simplifications"
"Finally there's just the stupid stuff. Off the wall UI decisions and omissions that appear to be brain farts that somehow made it to production. QuickTime player's full window-width volume control that resizes with the window makes it almost impossible to set a consistent volume level visually. Making a bring-to-front click in QuickTime Player's window also an active click in that window is just wrong (click near the play-position area while the app is not to front (to bring it to front) changes the play position without requiring a second click). Where is drag and drop editing in XCode with optional drag-and-drop text copy? How is it that Safari, after all these years, still cannot handle real-time mouse icon transitions (why are there occasions where I still have to close Safari windows clicking on the red close-control while the mouse is displaying a text bar, not a pointer)?"
"I am a Mac enthusiast. I'm not switching to Windows for production work any time soon (it still takes me 3 times the time to get similar complex projects finished under Windows (I have used both OS' for years)) but it does seem like Apple is lacking some core direction and that's a high level management issue not a technical one.> What's worse, Microsoft, against which Apple always measured its software's elegance and seamlessness, has shed its old shortcomings -- its Windows 10, released last year, garnered almost universal raves."
"Lol, because competition is bad right?! this will probs get burried. but does anyone feel like apple is repeating history with their software?"
"for example classic mac os in the later iterations started to become just a bunch of things added together with no thought and it suffered as a result until osx. But now i feel osx / ios are starting to walk down that path again and eventually apple will need another rebootI am not defending Apple, but Id like to give a little perspective.  "
"Imagine you are a software dev, and you are embracing a brand new platform, and getting in on the ground floor. Everything is possible, and you experiment and make a few stumbles, but people are willing to give you some breathing room because if you're the first product to market, they have no choice. And nothing else to unfavorably compare you to. The point is, you can make the rules.  "
"Now fast forward ten years. You try to make an app, but everything has already been done, and everything is patented, so you have to work around it and come up with different,  less elegant ways to do the same thing. You don't get to use your first, best idea, everything is your fourth or fifth solution to the same problem. And then there's legal telling you you cant do this and that, and then theres the marketing team telling you its too similar to something else you already have, and then theres a guy from the Asia-Pacific team telling you to change something because its actually a dirty word in Mandarin, and then theres a guy from another department telling you you have to change a button because its shaped like a holy symbol in some country they havent moved into yet but want to eventually, and then theres marketing again, telling you its not on message, and then these guys in black sunglasses tell you you have to take THIS out, because you didn't hear it from them, but its kind of similar to something they may or may not be working on for a future release.  "
"Its a miracle ANYTHING gets released any more. I wouldn't want to be a software dev if my life depended on it.It's sad that a billion dollar company has 'fans'.  People don't owe these companies anything yet I bet there are those in this thread defending their shitty practices because they happen to be in their ecosystemI don't love it, but have gone 3 years without any significant phone issue,  wiping my phone, closing app, or ios slowdown. With my androids prior it was s nightmare. I'd gladly go back to android but one  day into ownership of a s6 i experienced ui slowdown and said 'nope! I'd love to try it again but I'm scared. I have always loved the iPhone's I've owned, but I have to admit, with each iOS ipdate, my iPhone 5 seems to be getting slower and slower I bought an iphone 5 (my first) a year ago. It worked good, I was happy with it. Then came out iOS 9. I updated my phone. Biggest mistake ever. Phone got real slow and shiity in general very quickly. The software update couldn't be rolled back. They do this intentionally to force people to upgrade to the newer phone. When this phone dies completely, I'm going back to android.It's like Apple hired all the guys fired by Microsoft for making Vista, to make iTunes. iTunes is a steaming heap.iTunes really is garbage. Considering it's supposed tone the central hub between devices (I know iCloud is sort of supposed to be but yeah right...) it really is terrible. This probably wouldn't be as big of an issue on iOS if Apple turned the keys over to be able to set other programs as default. I hated Apple before it was cool. /sI do so love my Surface Book.iTunes has always been a beast from hell though...I can't remember how many times I had to uninstall and reinstall it on XP and 7 before finally getting rid of it completely. It is/was a resource hog, and once started, is ALWAYS running."
"I'm glad I found google play music when it was first starting out. It has it's problems, don't get me wrong, but I enjoy the fact I can just throw all my music form my spare hard drive onto the cloud and then I can access it anywhere I am, and only for like 7 bucks a month.> its Windows 10, released last year, garnered almost universal raves."
"That's a pretty big almost.I never knew so many people were having issues with Mail & Preview.  I can honestly say I've never had either of those crash on me.PAYWALLED LA Times is now on my banned list."
"Hey reddit please stop posting links to paywalled sites like this - it just encourages them to keep being dicks.it all went downhill after they started forcing newer software on older hardware I lost faith in Apple when they abandoned Aperture. Aperture 1.0 was exactly what the digital photography market needed. Photoshop is a great program but it never addressed the photography workflow concept at all. After Aperture came out Lightroom and various others followed but none did it as well as Aperture as of Aperture 3.0.  Aperture 3.0 had some issues. It didn't scale well for massive photo catalogs. It never had a means to correct optical flaws. Apple could have fixed that. But they didn't, they just let it rot.  "
"It seems like the same thing happened to Final Cut. As I understand it Final Cut was an industry leader in video editing and Apple dumbed the product down a few years ago and let the industry slip through their fingers. I have an iPhone. I like it pretty good. "
"I haven't used iTunes in years. Maybe that's why. "
"Why do people use iTunes? "
"I know you used to need it to update your phone a long time ago How have I never had these issues, Ive had my iPhone 5 since it came out and have the newest iOS. Aside from iTunes being annoying to manage songs on occasion none of these problems exist to me. I actively avoid plugging my iPhone into my PC, just to not have to deal with iTunes. People say the worst a lot these days, and it should probably be reserved for tyrannical dictators, mass killers and the like...and iTunes.You lost me when you said I had to plug my phone/tablet into a computer?..wtf..Wireless Sync, you should really look into that..I used to edit movies all the time in iMovie, but ever since they dropped the timeline editor I honestly don't know how to edit movies with sense of precision. The thing is a mess. I'll leave [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/43o3lf/uninstalling_facebook_app_saves_up_to_20_of/czjtuf7?context=3) here. It happened in 2009."
">One example: Forcing someone to install iTunes, Bonjour, Quicktime, and a bunch of other Apple crap on my PC then sync the damn thing just to use a usb cable as a charger back in '09. The dumb ipod refused to charge or give its owner a charge-only option to select. Only install-ALL-TH^E-THINGS."
">Took me over a month to remove all the iMalware and liberate my PC and media collection. ***NEVER AGAIN!***"
">EDIT: I'm sure Apple's cooled its jets about this since Tim Cook took over.Bullshit. Apple fans will never hate Apple. That's the main draw of their marketing machine. And if they have mild dislike for some of the software they will stick with Apple anywayThey should hire Steve Jobs back. That guy took the company places.Working in tech support, El Capitan is the devil...I went to upgrade the OS on my macbook. I first read the reviews and it seems like people hate the latest OS. Makes me nervous to upgrade.My only gripe is with iOS' version of iTunes.  This is coming from a guy who defended iTunes' honor over the last 10 years.iTunes is just dreadful to use. I dread having to open it do support for my family. besides the fact that every update makes your older devices a bit worse each time, iTunes is clunky, Safari is a memory suck, and it seems like they are going the way of Microsoft lately (aka, the release version should really be the Beta, and the upgrade is what the original release should have been but dont get used to it because a new one is coming down the pipeline)Whoever changed the way the music is organized on the iphone should go to jail for 1,000 counts of manslaughter. It used to be nice and easy to navigate and choose a somf. Now you have to scroll and look at your phone more just to play your song. Not a big problem until you think about all of the people driving that want to listen to their music."

"Ive always been a fan of both microsoft and apple. I really hope microsoft doesnt go down the apple route.Why the heck can't the music app be in landscape mode?The Itunes app on my phone makes zero sense to me, unless I sit down and manually create a playlist on my computer before opening on my phone. It's useless, worse than useless because all of my music is there but there's no easy way to find it."
"The desktop version is confusing and unnecessarily complicated. If I want to buy a fucking song or movie, I will go to the Itunes store and buy it; don't cram shit down my throat. Why's this so hard for people to understand?Apple's software and OS were the reason I used Apple, and the reason I stopped using Apple.I agree with the sentiment in this thread. They need to step up software quality like they used to. I've also been feeling bored with the iOS 7 aesthetic, where iOS 6 aesthetic didn't really get old until everything started to get flat."
"But it's amazing how only negative Apple threads will get any traction in this subreddit.I seriously hate when voice control takes over my iPhone and calls my ex via the Facebook contact list link.  "
"How do I turn voice control off?The iTunes Music app on iOS is an absolute mess. It used to be simple. I hate it! Any good alternatives?It blows my damn mind that can't send an attachment while IN the mail app. It's so dumb that you absolutely have to select something before composing the email."
"I'm a recent apple convert myself, and I do like many things, but it's things like that that make wonder how the hell it was even greenlit."
"The news app is damn near flawless, though.But. But apple is cool. It has commercials with lots of hands and colors and hip young people, that means its gotta be the best. Please apple, how much money do you want from me today?I don't have a problem with most Apple software. It seems to work just fine. But the Podcast app, now that is the biggest piece of shit app I've ever used. It frequently crashes, stops working in the middle of playing podcasts, etc. Then I have it set to not download anything, only streaming and somehow it is now taking up 1GB of space on my phone and I can't figure out why.I tried using iTunes a long time ago on my brother's computer. This was probably 2 years ago. And I'm still annoyed/pissed off.My iPad mini just crashed while I was reading this article.iTunes is so bad these days, article is right. I hate iTunes, the rest is okI haven't synced with itunes in ages. I use soundcloud and spotify. And in rare cases, youtube. Steve is dead so is apple.One of my Macs is very insistent that I upgrade to El Capitan. Hell no I say after upgrading the other two: no tangible benefits but busted audio implementation on one I did upgrade and wifi problems on the other (neither problem existed before the upgrade).Glad I'm not the only one who refuses to sync or update with any apple software. And seeing as my phones break like clockwork once the warranty is up I think I'm just going to try HTC.There are so many little things that piss me off every day. "

"> He fingered iTunes for the desktop (I dread opening the thing), and the Mail, Photos, and iCloud programs."
"iTunes: I play music with it.  It plays the music. What's to dread?"
"Mail: I don't use it."
"Photos: I don't use it."
"iCloud: I don't use it."
"People (understandably) hate using iTunes to manage their phone, but why are people using it for that? I haven't connected my phone to my laptop except for charging for years, literally. With iCloud backups, getting a new phone is as easy as plugging it in, logging into iCloud, and waiting a while."
"I don't buy apps through iTunes. I don't buy music through it (I actually like Apple Music - infinite pre-paid library, yay!). I don't back my phone up with it. What are people doing that they still need to have an opinion on how much it sucks to use iTunes with their phones?They made the Apple pencil! I honestly didn't believe that shit. I thought the Onion really nailed them good but it was realll life Apple have solid products in terms of build and construction, I won't deny that. Unfortunately, their software is terrible. Too many people are in the grasp of the bought another because I'm used to it mentality. With every update, their software is slower and less efficient on older hardware. It's times like these where I just want to tell people to buy a fucking Android already.Never had any issues with iTunes before but I sure can't get photos off my iphone 6 using the new photos Crapp. Although my phone is jailbroken so maybe it just doesn't play nice anymore. I had to buy Anytrans to get them on to my MacBook pro and now I prefer that method.Until they fire Tim Cook and hire someone more artsy than fartsy they are going to keep shitting the bed.  Their stock has been trending downward since the apple watch tanked.  "
"Apple needs a crazy, design happy, user experience oriented loon running the show.  That creature is decidedly not Tim Cook.Is this news to anyone? This is my thought, but I need help fleshing it out: whenever a person or an idea is great and becomes big time, then that corporation or organization will slowly be infiltrated by people that want to fleece the public. I need a better way to phrase this but I feel it happens all the time.Steve we need you :(Fucking keychain broke in the latest release...mother fuckery It's ironic, google which is such a excellent s/w developing org can't get the device right and on the other hand apple, who design and make some of the best devices can't get it's s/w right, right? Almost every daily app I used on my phone is actually from Google, youtube, mail, google photos(yeah it's better in syncing across plantforms than Photos), maps ect, but I can't stand the android devices and non-apple computers, it's just too much of an eye-sore.I used to love google music on my iPhone but now all searches default to the radio, not what is in my library."
"Drives me nuts.I've been buying iPod touches since they came out, mostly to have a dedicated music device, second for the apps. But with the latest music app update, I'm just done with it. It's a compete hassle, unintuitive and annoying overall to use. "
"Since iOS 7 I don't understand how people still love the iPhone. So much white, and to me overall such an annoying interface. I recently abandoned Apple and headed back to Android. The value's never been there, but now the quality is arguably lower than on the lion's share of Android-driven devices there's no reason for me to pay the premium.I guess I'm a minority...I have no issues with any of the software at all, and the updates that have any meaningful feature updates always add a nice little perk here and there that I end up using pretty consistently."
"My 2012 MBP is still working perfectly...and my iPhone, as it always does, works just how I need and want it to.  Are there things I wish we had? Sure! But I don't hate anything on any of my Apple products, because it all works just fine for me.I was especially pissed when I updated the OS and they removed iMovie and Garage Band from my '09 Macbook Pro. The laptop came with the programs and though they were pretty outdated, it still worked for my needs.  Sure, I could purchase the software for like $20 bucks, but the point is - why should I have to buy it again when I already owned it? "
"Also, I recently used the newer version iMovie on a school computer, and it is super super shitty. Just get rid of apple maps.. google maps is so far ahead of you.Some people would call me an Apple apologist, but I've use iTunes maybe once in the past year. It's not the best app, but there are few reasons to use it nowadays.Does anyone else blame planned obsolescence for this? I swear to god the more times I update my phone the slower and more inconsistent it gets. It would take a  moron not to notice that PO would eventually erode away at costumer satisfaction and the loss would catch up with the revenue of units sold.All apps, regardless of platform, will take up more requirements as they add features/improve/et-al. This isnt an issue with IOS, but every app on the phone. "
"people used to complain when their idevices didn't get updated. now they complain they get updates with new features that require more hardware resourcesBecause it's total shit unless you have very specific creative needs?I have an iPhone 4s, and I'm due to upgrade soon. I'm fairly certain I will be moving over to an android phone, Apple just keeps doing things I just don't like. Apple has to fall I owned an iPhone 1,2,3, and 4. I will never use an iPhone again after switching to Android. Apple locks down their phone devices too much and simply gives the user no control. Still at least love my macbook pro tho <3iTunes has always sucked, but the devices felt so good to use that it was 'worth it'"
"Now the competition has caught up on the hardware side IMO.I don't know if anyone has even touched on the cluster*** of the experience of trying to use an OS X device for work."
"I have a Macbook Air and it's a fantastic piece of hardware.  Light as hell, boots right up, does pretty much everything I want a personal-use computer to do.  Yes, iTunes is a mess but overall I can deal with it just fine."
"But try using native Apple apps for work - I dare you.  Mail is nice in principle, but isn't ready for prime time.  Your font size constantly changes, some of your recipients will receive your text emails as a series of image files that each contain a little of the text, and it eventually creates an enormous backup file that does nothing but take up space.  I didn't even attempt to use Pages, etc. for work, opting instead for Microsoft Office for Mac, which is consistently several years behind (but in fairness, is not an Apple product).  Safari works okay unless you want to use Sharepoint (again in fairness, neither Chrome nor Edge work quite right either).  But what's astonishing to me is that Apple hasn't even tried to build a Sharepoint interface that works worth a damn.Is this an old article? iTunes has been awful since I got an iPod Photo. It has not gotten better. It's only use is to load songs onto my phone, and back my data up. I've never understood considering iTunes as a primary media player, unless maybe I had a supercomputer and all the ram in the world. I traded over to an iPhone when the 6s was released because I hadn't used an iPhone since the 3gs.  I'm generally pretty tech savvy, love all tech but I honestly could not keep that phone.  Basic UI functionality had barely changed since the 3gs and its inability to handle notifications and true multitasking in any meaningful way was horribly absent.  At that point I truly realized that Android had been under fire for so long and so hard that they had really kept up, if not driven the mobile phone market in terms of usability.  I was extremely disappointed at Apple for that.Apple products have never been about work. They simply offer the most basic functionality required. Fans shoved them into the business place regardless of how well they performed. IT admins suffered for many years during this transition. Things have improved tremendously but man it was rough. "
"It would seem with iTunes, in particular, that every update makes it harder for me to manage my music. It less of a music management software now and has become a gateway to sell me more stuff.Why does the alarm clock on my have a set time for snooze?  Literally every other alarm clock in the world lets you program how long a snooze it. my first iphone came with two or three apps i didn't use and i pushed them way off to the third or fourth page.  but now, on my third, i have a whole folder of nearly 20 apps that apple deems necessary that i have no known use for.  "
"watch, safari, reminders, ibooks, videos, health, mail, news, find friends, maps, stocks, wallet, podcasts, compass, contacts, tips, voice memos and game center.  Apple Music could try having a decent app instead of trying to strong arming people with exclusives.I enjoy my ipod's and my work iphone but updates suck and I have never liked Macs. Cannot stand the backwards UI. I don't believe there are Apple fans anymore, there are just people buying apple products.I haven't used iTunes for years...VLC is much better in so many ways.  I don't even use iTunes on my iPhone anymore, because it's slow, stupid, and takes forever to boot up.  And I just installed Linux Mint yesterday because your freedom keeps diminishing with every new OS.  No, I don't want to have to use XCode for tasks that shouldn't require it.  Yeah, Apple needs to get their shit together or they're going to lose a lot of customers.  The last time I had an iPhone device was when I upgraded from iPhone 3 to iPhone 4.  I really liked the iPhone, but I hated how it forced the Appstore and reliance on iTunes which was progressively getting shittier, slower, and more bulky.  I couldn't stand how putting a new album on my phone was suddenly a chore.  I also loathed having to use iPhoto anytime I wanted to add/remove photos. Then the software update came out and my phone became borderline unusable even though it was only like a year old.  I personally switched to android and never looked back, but I figured they'd smooth out the problems and streamline it back to what people loved.  It blows my mind that over 5 years later everyone still has the SAME core issues with their iPhones.It's funny, I've always been a PC and I have always owned Samsung phones, yet I quite enjoy iTunes. It sorts music very well and looks very nice. Not to mention the ease with which you can share music on it. They didn't even point out a legitimate problem with it. I think it's improved over the last 2 years. "
"Edit: literally no one agrees with mei agree with you. years ago, when ipods were ubiquitous, i began using itunes to sync and manage my music on my pc and have been using itunes without any major problems ever since."
"my favorite thing about it is the way i can display all my music by album covers. so pretty pretty...Yeah, I have a lot of music, and while the normal file browser only sorts it by artist name, I can sort by whatever I'd like in iTunes. I'm using an iPhone 5... Im fed up with it but can't afford to replace itI liked apple products when the iPhone came on the scene, truly a great product that ushered in the new era of smart phones. Then I switched to Android and never thought of anything else. I don't need a computer to transfer music and files. Apple prides itself on its limited access and over priced products with pleasing aesthetic looks. Every apple fan I have met knows next to nothing about computers and insists that apple it's the end all be all of technology. Half these problems with Apple's eco system could be solved with two major changes:"
"1.  Finally build their next Mac OS kernel and move beyond OSX.   Really, they have had OSX since 1999.   The OS is practically a centenarian in computer years.   Time to retire it and face the future with a new OSXI build.   Microsoft went through the pain so it is possible to get past using an aged kernel and file system."
"2.   Stop using iTunes as the Grand Central Station for everything mobile-related.   it's a music service.   Polish that part and detach all those update services, file/calendar/FB syncs, and App installs off it.   Make a separate iControl for all of that other mobile stuff.  The less cluttered a program is, the more it will be as Jobs said, It just works.For #1 I'm pretty sure the windows kernel is older, but your #2 is spot on.apple died with steve...Close.  Apple died when they lost Steve to keep Ive in line.  "
"Apple will be able to survive if Ive gets hit by a Truck ... because as Steve said, there's always going to be a need for a Truck (not a trash can).  "
"Said truck may be figurative, but the more ineffective Cook has become in keeping Ive from doing stupid UI things (more minimalism in the wrong places) the more I suspect that the Truck needs to be a literal one. Precisely why I still use Logic Pro 9 and won't go any higher than Mavericks. Don't even get me started on iTunes and Apple Music.... Together, they have created a Spotify user fo lyfe. Itunes aside (worst ever) I am extremely disappointed with the iphone mail app - Ok it works, but it is featureless! why cant i send two pictures via email? why cant i collapse folder? WHYThat'll happen when you rely on marketing and brand name recognition rather than the actual product...I've loved Apple's products From 1997 till the launches of the trashcan (MacPro) and the Retina display MacBook Pro."
"Photos is a horrible replacement for iPhoto."
"BusyCal makes Calendar (formerly iCal) look like trash."
"PathFinder puts the Finder to shame!"
"The UI changes to iTunes make the program almost unusable!"
"Apple hardware direction started taking a turn for the worse even before Steve Jobs passed on. Thinner and Lighter isn't always the answer!!!!"
"Less ports sucks!"
"And now onto the crowning crime to end them all..."
"The MagSafe Adapter."
"Made by Apple to solve the most basic of problems. Humans tripping over cords, and breaking their expensive computers."
"This single feature drove so many people to take another look at Apple Laptops, it can't be overstated."
"Yes Apple's newest flagshit (not a typo) laptop: The MacBook has abandoned this stalwart of Apple's laptops since 2006!!!"
"This is NOT the Apple I fell in love with, and it sure as hell isn't the Apple that showed the world excellence in software design!The complete and utter debacle on Mac OS X when they moved Ebooks out of iTunes and into a separate iBooks app, removing the ability to edit metadata for books (kind of important if, like me, you create your own out of technical notes) and then actually moving all your books from your iTunes library and hiding them (and renaming each one with an obscure name and burying them five layers deep in your user folder?)"
"Whoever thought that was a good idea ought to be sacked. "
"Apple: We can no longer decrypt iPhones for law enforcement, starting w/ iOS 8.Apple refers to the 6/6 rating from the EFF Who has your back? report. Here's the report and the other companies reviewed: https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-2014"

"Steve Jobs wanted to create products for the artists.  Tim Cook, however, is a business guy.

Regardless of how nice and attentive a company might appear on the outside, there's nothing the public can do to verify these claims, which means trusting them is just that: trusting them."
"We ought to view these privacy policies and transparency reports as just what they are: marketing material. Personally, I don't trust them any more than I trust the average TV commercial.

One fights the enemies of the state, the other serves and protects the people. When the military becomes both, then the enemies of the state tend to become the people.Agreed. Wasn't the government supposed to keep us secure from companies?"
"Edit: Sorry, I'm not a government major. I was informed several times that this is wrong.The government should punish a criminal who breaks into your house.  They are not responsible for putting locks on your doors.The US government was only ever **supposed** to keep us safe from the aggression of others (originally). Companies have voluntary interactions with their customers. "
"I am happy to live in a western country but if you look at all governments ever you should not be surprised. It's run by humans and humans are fucked up.Essentially if you live in a first world country someones fucking you over and you dont know it. If you live in a third world country then youve already been fucked over and you know it. > We have also never allowed any government access to our servers. And we never will."
"Allowed is the important word here. Judging by the fact that single hacker leaked photos from iCloud, they don't have that good security system.I applaud Apple's commitment to user privacy, but it's clear they chose their words very carefully. For one, as you pointed out, they have never _allowed_ the government access to their servers. They also don't comment on whether they _give out_ information when asked by, for example, law enforcement. Personally, I think that's OK, if a person is properly suspected of a crime. It's the warrantless, routine collection of data on otherwise innocent people I despise."
"It's clear Apple wants to impress upon people that they value their privacy and rights, but it's also clear they're not openly defiant of law enforcement or intelligence gathering as a whole. They'll abide by the laws such as they are written, but they take an open stand against the secret kind of intelligence gathering so popular these days.Do people expect Apple to go against the law before they will allow that Apple is trying to ensure customer privacy and transparency? Are we also asking Amazon, Facebook and Google to be as defiant of law enforcement? If not why?I don't like it even if suspected of a crime. To me it's about the same as being suspected of robbing a store I didn't rob then having my house bugged until they determine I'm not a suspect. For instances in the documentary cracktown USA law enforcement bugged a crackhouse not just until a crime was committed, they did that for like a year, can you imagine ever word and in this case video of what you did in your home open to someone else's interpretation?That's not a problem with surveillance per se, but rather a problem with what kind of surveillance is _legal_ and why. The problem isn't that they _do_ this, the problem is that they _are allowed to_. Fix the laws, and you fix the problem (at least in a perfect world)."
"When I say it's OK for Apple to cooperate with law enforcement, mean that under the conditions of there being a _specific_ warrant that is clearly limited in both time and scope. There should have to be a suspicion of a crime of a certain degree or severity before a judge can even order a warrant, and the warrant itself should be specific and narrow, as well as limited in time."
"These things aren't Apple's war to fight. In fact, it's more yours. Elect representatives that protect your rights by limiting the powers of law enforcement and courts. Speak to them about these issues and _why_ you feel the system does not work the way it's set up today.Apple doesn't have a stance either way; they will follow the law and they will also release statements to their customers that they want to hear. Who knows, in ten years we may be thankful for much of this data gathering; but, don't be surprised when all the players involved laud their efforts in helping the Government get the information.I don't understand your position."
"Apple does not collect meaningful amounts of data, and what is collected is not specific per user."
"Anything that does need to pass through Apple's servers is encrypted and Apple does not have the key."
"Apple responds to LE requests only when presented a warrant, and will provide only the smallest amount of information necessary to fulfill the request. (stated in the link)"
"So Apple does not collect routine data on otherwise innocent people, and seem to be as openly defiant as they possibly can to LE and intelligence gathering as a whole.What about the celebrity nudes? Everyone had access to those.allowedFrom the way they encrypt the data, that really would be the easiest way for a government to get in. But as the fappening showed us, most people are so insecure in their day to day internet life that no government would really care that much if apple said no. They got other avenues to persue - more than they can count.No fucking shit. It's blatantly obvious that someone could hack into their servers or physically steal their data centers, literally no one is safe from this. This is more anti-apple circlejerk right here.Except that if they had they would also be legally  unable to admit it....and plausible deniability is the important operational principle here.That's nice and all, but that sentence fragment is upsetting me.I still do not understand why so many people believe Snowden's bullshit. You have all had ample time to learn how the networks have been built and how the systems operate. You have also had ample to time to honestly assess the feasibility of the claims. "
"I have been in this industry for 15 years, and I have not heard a single expert critique this silliness in the media. "
"Let me help you out. The only truth to any of it was the call data (who called who and when). And, I would chalk that up to laziness from the telco. The other claims are fanciful crap. "
"Jesus, people. Do some research. As if they would have a choice. I'm sure everyone is just really happy to hand it all over to government.No permissive entry. Oh myyyyy.If they rephrase this to given access or allowed then I'm sold. This is the same argument everybody used when the first privacy shitstorm hit"
"Its just spin"
"You don't NEED to give anyone access to the physical servers, and they don't need to waste their time travelling, if you're willing to just email them any info they want off it."
"They never said we've never allowed them to have your data, they said a very specifically and carefully worded response that ALMOST means they never gave your data"
"If you actually read the linked page, and the more detailed reports linked from it, they are very specific about how many law enforcement requests they have received, breaking them down by category, region and country, and giving the best estimate of the ones they're not allowed to talk about they are legally permitted to."
"> A tiny percentage of our millions of accounts is affected by national security-related requests. In the first six months of 2014, we received 250 or fewer of these requests. Though we would like to be more specific, by law this is the most precise information we are currently allowed to disclose.> If you actually read the linked page"
"Nobody here does that, especially if it involves Apple. They just comment with their gut.Or the govt doesn't actually need access to their servers to get their shit.Afaik Apple recently transferred cloud services from Amazon's cloud to their own newly constructed server farms. On these servers they threw away the backend encryption keys as soon as the drives were encrypted. So now quite  literally there is no way to decrypt the data without the users password. Which password Apple can only access by resetting, and per system protocols once a password is reset it can never be the same password again. So the only way to break in would necessitate the user knowing they had been compromised. "
"Even if the NSA had access to the physical machines the only way they could access  the data is by having copied the encryption keys the moment they were created. It is therefore feasible to think that they may not have access. Sure. But I hope you're not suggesting that it renders the claim meaningless? The NSA is a hugely sophisticated spying organization. I don't know that Apple, or anyone else can assert with certainty that their serves are not breached."
"That Apple does not consent, or actively permit government access to those servers (it claims), is meaningful and important. I wonder which of the other tech giants can make such a statement.[deleted]What if I told you that google's version of open source isn't really that open? Do they pay astroturfers by the word now?>What if I told you that google's version of open source isn't really that open?"
"It is far more open then Apple. Yes, all the apps that google develops are closed source, but you can chose not to use or run them. With apple, you are strait up stuck.What if I told you that aosp is released by Google every upgrade. You sound like you're quoting something you thought you heard/read. When people say Android isn't really open source they mean that the public doesn't have access to or develop for the code prior to release, unlike other open source projects where the community can contribute to at any time.AOSP Android is shit now, especially since Google have released their *own* closed source version of the majority of Android Apps.Yes, their own apps that *they* developed in house and offer for *free* are closed, but the majority of the OS is open for development."
"I don't see a problem with them protecting some of their own code (when compared to Apple anyway).If it's such shit, then how does it end up being the base of CyanogenMod, Paranoid Android, OmniROM et. al.? Not to mention it's what Amazon starts off with for all of its devices.To be honest a lot of important (although not essentials) parts of Google's Android, like Google play Services, are closed source. Indeed but they are not a part of the OS though, they are applications on top.... that you can use Android entirely without.Does *anyone* actually do that?The claim is meaningless. If that whole NSA sorry achieved one thing it's that weird doublespeak. They don't give them access to the server? Great, so I guess they're either pushing the requested data. Or give the NSA access to the network instead of the servers so they can read the data as it goes by. The claim is meaningless because the servers are meaningless. The data is what the government shouldn't get. I may just be high, but *what the fuck are you talking about?*I think I got it, he's saying like if you told your mom you didn't take the cookies from the cookie jar, but what you don't tell her is you told your younger brother to take them and share with you. "
"Disclaimer: I could be wrong as fuck. /u/Bolusop is acknowledging the prevalence of doublespeak in ... everywhere, but especially statements directed to 'the public.' It's when you say something that is technically true but misleading. It's the deliberate misuse of language."
"It's like the husband who says to his wife I never slept with that whore! And really he fucked the whore, yet never lay in the bed and slept with her. It's *technically* true, but deceptive in the context of what the issue really is. "
"(It works too if you put the emphasis on *that*. The husband didn't sleep with *that* whore; he slept with *this* one.)"
"He is monkeying around with language to lie without telling a falsehood."
"Apple is trying to get street cred for some action/condition they may or may not be doing, and we have no idea what's going on, except we've seen some pretty scary PPT presentations about the grand scale and power of nation-state scale spying. "
"**TLDR: Weaselwords. They're weasel words.**When privacy is concerned, corporations and agencies are known to craft their PR statements in such a way that they are accurate (so they don't lie), however the meaning is only valid for those carefully chosen words together."
"For example:"
"> We have also never allowed any government access to our servers.    "
"This could still mean (I'm not saying it does, just that it *could*) that:    "
"- they never specifically *allowed* access, but did not forbid it either    "
"- *they* had never allowed access, but someone else did    "
"- they could be renting their servers so they are not technically *their own* servers     "
"- they could be allowing access to another company, not the government itself   "
"- they could send the government any data they request    "
"- etc, etcI think more accurate for Apple would be 'we store no data worth anything to the govt. So we aren't as bad as the cell companies that we support /support us amirite?' > they had never allowed access, but someone else did"
"This is especially important, since iCloud is hosted on Microsoft and Amazon cloud services.Not anymore actually. What they're referring to is the new server farms Apple built. Once the drives were encrypted they threw away the persistent  state encryption keys, so literally, without your password there is no way to access the data. > Once the drives were encrypted they threw away the persistent state encryption keys"
"err what?Well its not like they have any ability to control that... so I don't think the blame should be put on the company.the large companies like Apple and Google are going to have to be the ones to take a stand... its just way to easy for the government to take out the smaller companies i disagree.  smaller companies can refuse and just go out of business. a few have done that.  larger companies don't have that option.The scary thing about this is that criminals would just move their communications away (even program their own encrypted networks, don't even have to rely on ToR) leaving the only people governments can spy on as innocent, everyday, people. Therefore, the only reason governments want this access is to control the population (figure out how they tick in private, then manipulate this).Someone else posted this link on the Julain Assange AMA - https://wikileaks.org/Op-ed-Google-and-the-NSA-Who-s.html "
"I don't think you can trust Google, they are tied to the NSA etc.No.  It's the big telecom ISP providers that have to.  They own the backbones that all internet traffic flows through.  You don't need to break into someones mailbox to read their mail if you can simply read it inside the mail truck or at the post office.Even if they did, they are limited in their ability to publicize it. Yahoo fought for a quite a while without anyone knowing. true.. but enough people Google that I bet if they put it on their front page daily it would get noticed...otherwise isps would block it via big brother... but I'd hope that would be a wakeup call..The problem is gag orders. They literally *can't* put it on their front page. The best that they could do is add a canary.why not? what's the worse that would happen from violating a gag order? fines that could be put off while the legal team fights it and the support of the populace is aquiredGoogle won't be shutdown, they'll just start putting shareholders in jail. I don't think you understand the 'limited liability' part of a limited liability company. I'm not saying I know what would happen, but pursuing shareholders is not one of them.Banks get away with much worse every day and they're still in business. What's the government going to do? Put Google in jail?At that point I think there would be public outrage too."
"If the top people in Apple and Google are put in jail because they won't spy on their users, then you would have a trial, and I think he american people would notice. "
"Tech press and tech journalism is getting bigger every year. That would make huge waves. The NSA wouldn't risk that. It would jeopardize their operation and draw too much attention to it. >I think he american people would notice"
"The problem is, they wouldn't.Well that's the point of a canary. Ever heard of a miner's canary? Miners would take a canary with them, because they were known to be fragile. If the canary died suddenly, the miners knew they hit a poison gas pocket and should evacuate."
"And a gag order canary is similar - it's something that is part of the site, saying We aren't under a gag order, as of [current date]! Then if they get put under a gag order, they simply kill the canary by not updating it. People see the dead canary, and know that they're under a gag order. And legally, a gag order *cannot* force someone to continue to update something (like the canary). That would be a very slippery slope, where the government could say We're compelling you to lie to these people, and will throw the book at you if you refuse!"
"And, in Yahoo!'s case, they were threatened with *enormous* fines (it was like $200k **per day** or something crazy like that,) unless they followed the gag order *and* allowed access.In case anyone doesn't believe /u/Mr_Cumbox , here's an article about it: http://boingboing.net/2013/11/05/apple-hides-a-patriot-act-bust.html"
"You can also find out more by searching for the term 'warrant canary'.[deleted]You're so right, its not like the government would harass them with permanent audits by the IRS, or suddenly find kiddie porn on some of their spoke-peoples computers etc."
"..."
"You are vastly underestimating the stupidity of the average public and the creativity of people in power."
"[deleted]Try and tell that story to Julian Assange, maybe you can still catch him on his AMA.ceo? thats what sysadmins and middle management is for...They had one, but now it's gone."
"http://boingboing.net/2014/09/18/apples-patriot-act-detecting.htmlThe company can't break a gag order, but laptops with secret documents get stolen all the time.They can use canary text on their frontpage.... they sure can, so that 2% of the people might get it... successBut it'll be translated and spread around for the masses by the 2%as opposed to us all knowing already that there are secret courts and absolute surveillance?"
"There is nothing wrong with canaries, problem is that they are both useless and are now becoming a symbol of resistance to some, that are just that, a meaningless symbol."
"Instead of actually taking action, symbolism is once again paralyzing the public discourse.Unless news networks think that some hacker called 4chan changed the reports.I don't see why they don't add a canary though.  What does that mean?The company publishes a monthly report that includes a section claiming to never have received requests for information from the government. If in their next report the section is missing, you know that it's no longer true. The point is to get the message out without actually saying anything. They did!"
"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/11/apples-first-transparency-report-gets-warrant-canaries-rightWhat happens if someone defies a gag order? dedContempt of court. At that point the court can order jail time (to the executives in the case of a company) or fines, or both."
"It gives the court an open ticket to do almost whatever they want to you, at that point you don't get to have a defense, appeal, or anything else unless they feel like giving it to you."
"Edit: There's no requirement for proportionality either, like a normal punishment. The court could fine you a million dollars an hour until you comply if it felt like it.So basically you have to lube up?Lube up and relax.what happens, if an international subsidiary defies the gag order that has been placed on the US company (e.g. the Google Finland Oy tells that drive isn't safe for use, because it might leak information to the NSA)?Then the US company broke the gag order.https://wikileaks.org/Op-ed-Google-and-the-NSA-Who-s.html"

"Uti nsa im cu si"
"Translates to:"
"If i wish to use the NSAI don't get it. Wouldn't a gag order simply prevent the companies that use the warrant canaries from deleting or modifying the canaries since that would technically mean that those companies are violating the gag order indirectly by indirectly telling people that they received a gag order?Deniability is the key here. Intern Steve forgot to add that paragraph this week. Stupid Steve.Logically yes, but legally no. A National Security letter gags the company from confirming, denying, or talking about the National Security letter. "
"Source: my faulty memory and poor understanding of US law."
"Edit: maybe I'm a liar. Wikipedia doesn't say much except that a gag order is an option: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security_letter "
"and the EFF actually makes it sound like even a canary would be too revealing like you said: https://www.eff.org/issues/national-security-letters Recipients of NSLs are subject to a gag order that forbids them from ever revealing the letters' existence to their coworkers to their friends or even to their family members much less the public. What happens if you violate the order? Is that like...treason or something?> A National Security letter gags the company from confirming, **denying**, or talking about the National Security letter."
"So wouldn't that mean they would HAVE to remove the text denying the presence of an order that period?"
"I don't believe so.  Back in the old days when AAA auto club was first started, they used to have dudes riding around on motorcycles to help motorists.  One of the things these guys used to do, was warn motorists if there was a cop around who might catch them speeding.  The cops got pissed at this and the court said they couldn't tell motorists this info.  So what the AAA motorcycle dudes did was, they started always saying Hi to all motorists (salute? cap brim tip?).  If they DIDNT do this, now that meant there was a cop around.  Court can't mandate that the motorcycle dudes greet all motorists.Yeah I tried. Translating a single letter sounded stupid anyways. What was supposed to happen?The warning is Using TrueCrypt is not secure as it may contain unfixed security issues"

"uti nsa im cu si = if im with the use of the NSA according to Google translate. That's what he meant. Seems like reaching to me."
"http://boingboing.net/2014/06/17/possible-hidden-latin-warning.html"
"*uti nsa im cu si is meaningless in Latin - except to Google translate, (mis)translates it to the message Badon discovered."
"Neither im nor cu are Latin words at all, and while si and uti are, they don't mean the words that Google claims they do: instead, si translates to if, and uti to in order to. What seems to have happened is that Google recognised enough Latin words to think it was translating a real sentence, and then made its best effort to cram the rest of the words into a vaguely grammatical sentence.*"
"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/17/truecrypt-secret-message-nsa-spyingShhh, don't let logic get in the way of a good conspiracy.I think that's the point of it though.  The NSA/government comes back at Truecrypt and says, Whoa!  We had a gag order, but you let info out!  Truecrypt says, No we didn't.  We had a string of gibberish and someone used Google translate in Latin and it came up with something that just happened to be relevant.  However, it's clearly not Latin, or any language, by any stretch, so we have done nothing wrong.But I heard that if you take the third letter of every word in the Book of Revelations, scramble them, add a few letters then remove some, it says the NSA is hacking all our computers.I was actually reading an article about how companies like google have a warrant canary in their monthly reports."
"Now that they are releasing reports in how often the government requests any information, there is a small section that says that they haven't received any requests (warrants) pursuant to a specific statute."
"The warrants under that statute come with a gag order, so the second they get one that part of their report will go missing. Then everyone will know there's a gas leak in the mine shaftWouldn't the gag order require them to keep writing they hadn't gotten any requests?A gag order can only legally prevent them from writing/publishing information. It can't force them to write anything. That's why it works so well.I'm a little doubtful that our secret courts won't be able to handle this development. They could argue that *not* putting up the canary message violates the gag order. Or just heavily imply it, and imply that there will be consequences if the cat gets out of the bag in any way. The fact that we have secret courts at all makes this kind of plausible to me. Where should I go for this sort of news though? When something like this happens, it tends to get filtered out before it hits my news cycle or front page or whatever. So when people smell gas after seeing that there's (as I read it) no warrant canary in Google's newest monthly report, what site should I be tuned into to be on top of that news? [serious]I would assume, if something big enough as Google getting hit with a gag order came to light, it's going to do so in a rather big way. You would have to assume that Google would only be served a warrant if someone was looking for something specific. If it becomes a raid style situation, I would bet my house on the fact that you'll find out.shiiit"
"i work at a marketing company in NZ and a email was sent around today COMMANDING employees not to upgrade their company issued ipads to IOS 8."
"if we did we would face disciplinary action...We got the same thing... but working for the IT dept here I know the reason isn't malicious.   They simple don't want a shit ton of support calls when every apple device that gets upgraded needs to be re-added to airwatch mobile device management (assuming air watch will even work out of the gate).If it's anything like my work, they told us to hold off to make sure there's not anything that needs to be patched in iOS 8 first, security errors, errors with our company apps, etc.  In like a week they'll probably say it's all good to update.What happens if the the gov't threatens to fine them $250k a day until it got access like it did with Yahoo?Apple can afford that for a good 10-20years without breaking a sweat$250k a day is $91million a year, and Apple has nearly $100 BILLION in cash reserves, they could pay it for a thousand years solely on that.Yeah, but the fines doubled every week.If that's the case I'd just run it out because by week 30 you're over 130 Trillion dollars which is just doctor evil laughable as it exceeds the GDP of the entire planet.I'm doing something similar with student loans... Cept the fine doubled weekly. [Except that the daily fine for Yahoo was set to double for each week of non-compliance](http://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/2gli8t/after_just_203_days_yahoos_fine_from_nsa/)[deleted]You read the link?"
">On devices running iOS 8, your personal data such as photos, messages (including attachments), email, contacts, call history, iTunes content, notes, and reminders is placed under the protection of your passcode. Unlike our competitors, Apple cannot bypass your passcode and therefore cannot access this data. So it's not technically feasible for us to respond to government warrants for the extraction of this data from devices in their possession running iOS 8. The real thing is, is all that data sufficiently encrypted? I suspect that it isn't and that having physical access to the device would be enough to get around the 'passcode' in the same way that one can access the entire contents of a Windows computer by booting it off a linux live CD.Would it be so hard for people like you to go read Apple's security whitepaper instead of making blind guesses (that are wrong) about how security on iOS works?[removed]> A whitepaper merely says what Apple could do. "
"So... now your contention is that Apple is actually lying about the way iOS security works?"
"Really, that is your argument that you are right? A conspiracy theory?"
">What if the new iOS updates the modem firmware so that your passcode gets stored on the modem where the NSA can easily download it via 3G? There's all sorts of creative ways to leak data."
"So... yes. A conspiracy theory. Apple has put in a back door for law enforcement."
"Essentially your argument is based on not trusting Apple when they say how iOS works."
"Or in other words... it is based on nothing.Cunningham's Law: The best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question, it's to post the wrong answer.All iPhones are hardware encrypted. You cannot brute force the passcode using an image of the iPhone. You must have access to the physical device.I would add to this that your passcode is salted ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography) ), most likely with some unique ID associated with your device, when used as the key to decrypt your data. In other words, a 3rd party like the government wouldn't be able to just try all combinations of 4-digit passcodes to decrypt your data.> *Apple* cannot bypass your passcode and therefore cannot access this data"
"Does that rule out decryption with a private key that only the NSA has?So it's not technically feasible for us to respond to government warrants for the extraction of this data from devices in their possession running iOS 8."
"This is so carefully worded as to become meaningless. It may not be technically feasible to extract the data from the devices, but that doesn't preclude the existence of unencrypted data stored on phones nor the existence of server side copies of the data.what this really says is that if you don't download iOS8 and continue running older versions of iOS, you may be fucked because we've been fucking up all this time. Probably; it is most likely another way to force users off older platforms that cost them money to support.Maybe.  It's kind of like this commercial apple made https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnEo82-hFHE"
"In 30 seconds I learned that apple has previously been making shit headphones, but now they got it right. The funny thing is, the earpods weren't any different from the previous earphones, they just directed the sound into the ear canal; where would we be if not for crack marketing?It's still a good thing. There would be different legal standards and processes for obtaining that other data you mention. Whether or not it's a good thing is hard for us to determine; we just need to assume that every company is going to use our data for their own purposes and not get hung up over their verbal masturbation :)> but that doesn't preclude the existence of unencrypted data stored on phones nor the existence of server side copies of the data."
"There is no data on the phone that is not encrypted. "
"And they are very upfront about the fact that LE still has access to device backups and other information stored on iCloud."
"In fact, OP article explicitly points it out as well.That's such a lie.you would praise it if google said something like thatWith Google we could view the source code No, i would question it and people would be able to prove it VERY easily due to the source code being easier to get to.Pretty sure that guy who shut down his whole email site due to government pressure made the same claims. We saw how well that worked out.I'm assuming if you lose your passcode then you can't retrieve your data anymore?Passcode is the code to unlock your phone."
"> Passcode is the code to unlock your phone."
"It's also used to get the decryption key for the flash memory. Once the passcode is gone you can't decrypt the flash memory."
"The other people who have replied don't know what they are talking about."
"Unless you have a backup on your computer or iCloud, if you lose the passcode to your device, you are shit out of luck for getting any data off of it.Pay them in pirated mp3s. You'll be at $250k after a few tracks, if court verdicts are a reflection of true value.Court verdicts are not a way of making you pay the exact amount you stole. If you embezzle a million dollars from a company your not simply forced to pay it back and go on your merry way."
"I'm not trying to say that the amounts aren't absurd for stealing music, however to assume that the fines directly correlate to the value of the mp3's is wrong. I thought the party-line was due to your actions, we have $xxx,xxx in lost earnings for our artists."
"I really want to see how they come up with those numbers, either way.Give the Government a free U2 album?Hey now, we're trying to avoid a fine not increase itAll they're really saying is that most requests are from law enforcement to assist in locating lost/stolen phones. The fact that they can't disclose any information on national security related requests is a gaping hole in the pro-privacy image they're trying to create. The government has used national security as an excuse to hide an absurd variety of things over the past several years, and this will be no different. Right from the website:"
">National Security Orders from the U.S. government."
">A tiny percentage of our millions of accounts is affected by national security-related requests. In the first six months of 2014, we received 250 or fewer of these requests. Though we would like to be more specific, by law this is the most precise information we are currently allowed to disclose."
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security_letter"
"The thing is one request could cover millions of accounts so that number is meaningless.  They could request data for every single Chinese customer for example.  Probably many millions of people, one request.  They could request data from every single account that matches a list of key words for example, or every account in the US that contacted a foreigner."
"Additionally, they say a tiny number of accounts are affected by national security requests.  What exactly does affected mean?  In NSA speak they used this terminology to refer to accounts that are actually accessed by humans, but the millions of accounts that are scanned by computers are not considered to have been searched or affected by the NSA."
"Finally, this statement completely ignores Executive Order 12333 collection which is a huge, gaping, black hole.  It was EO 12333 that allowed the NSA to break into Google and Yahoo servers overseas and copy entire databases.  Basically the NSA can do whatever they want overseas as long as it's part of a legitimate national security investigation.  They don't need a warrant or even prior authorizations and they don't need to tell congress, the public or the companies involved what they're doing and any Americans' data that is accessed as a result is considered incidental collection and is fair game for the full gamut of NSA analysis."
"For all we know the NSA has full access to Apple servers overseas and all our data is routinely scanned and accessed.  To Apples' credit this sort of thing would probably be done without their knowledge, but we shouldn't just trust that our data is safe simply because they say so.Guys, is it so complicated to read an article?"

"**13743** - Number of Devices Specified in the Requests  "
"**789** - Total Number of Law Enforcement Account Requests   "
"**1739** - Number of Accounts Specified in the Requests  "
"So yes, one request can cover more than one device/account.   "
"But no, it is not probably millions but only a factor of 2.That number may not include data disclosures that are under a gag order. You simply can't take these numbers at face value.Interesting.  I work in computer forensic for a law enforcement agency (local level).  Any passcode-protected iPhone after the 4S, we have been unable to bypass, and even if we did it would not matter due to encryption.  If it was 4S+ we would write a search warrant and serve Apple Corp with it.  The waiting list to have Apple bypass the passcode was/is about a year.  I have heard they only have one employee servicing these SW request."
"Now, I can only relate to this from a local level.  I have no clue how the three-letter agencies interact with Apple."
"I'm all about protecting peoples rights, so lower your pitchforks!  Prior to SW being required to search a cellular phone incident to arrest, I was pro-SW being required.  I'd rather someone search my house, than my computer and cell phone.  "

"So any devices.Your [comment history](http://www.redditgraphs.com/?-moose-&ScatterPlot&Length&Comments) seems to be mostly spam and copy pasted links along these lines."
"You do realize that for that exploit to work the NSA needed physical access to the device? And it was patched when discovered.[removed]Come on seriously, that article is lousy even for the Huffington Post."
"And the Daily Dot article makes explicit that the access spoken of in the article comes from the NSA putting their own software on an iPhone, not from Apple's software.[removed]Why are you so butt hurt? I really think its stupid as shit to assume somebody's age based on their reddit username and then use that as a stick to beat them with. Doing that's also pretty immature.Yea because the DOJ cant [Strongarm Apple like they did Yahoo](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/09/15/you-think-youve-got-bills-government-could-have-fined-yahoo-trillions-of-dollars/)The proof is in the pudding, or in this case, the nature of iOS 8's encryption methods. The difference is Apple literally can't give them the data even if they wanted to. They try their damned hardest not to have access to your data at all. For example, iMessages are stored encrypted on the server (and Apple obviously doesn't have your private key), and now iOS 8 stores all local data encrypted, so Apple has no way of unlocking it without your knowledge. It should be noted that Android can be configured to encrypt your local storage as well, but Google obviously has all your data on the server anyway, and can be forced to turn it over.You also can't just blindly believe the best in everyone when the stakes are so high.I hear where you're coming from, but you don't think people have a good argument to be cynical given recent developments in the last couple of years? Why should anyone give any credence to what anyone thinks about the subject when it is clearly a technical matter? The amount of opining and guesswork allowed on the internet is ridiculous. Present some technological explanation for your argument, or you aren't making one at all. You're just flipping a coin at that point. "
"Skip all that, though, far better explanations as to how this encryption works are present in this and other threads. They are far better than the guesswork you are promoting. The National Security Requests were what grabbed my attention. They are forced to comply, and can't divulge specific information on the volume of requests they process. They are effectively saying they comply with most federal requests for phone access but comply with local law enforcement only on a case by case basis. Even then they comply when legally obligated according to this.The NSA isn't law enforcement. They have never allowed gov't onto their servers because the gov't never asked. Instead they showed up and said you'll owe us loads of money and be in jail if you don't let us look over your shoulder.You don't need access to servers if you can monitor all the data going in and out.[Cellebrite.](http://www.cellebrite.com/)"
"The reason Apple receives so few requests for data, is it's mostly not necessary."
"The device is cloned by LEA, all of it.  Forensics tools are then run at their convenience, on the cloned drive.  Most times the encrypted data is not necessary.  LEA uses the forensics tools to prove intent, location, or a synergy of unprotected data."
"Also:     "
"> *...National security-related requests are not considered Device Requests or Account Requests and are reported in a separate category altogether.*"
"Apple doesn't provide the numbers for the national security-related requests either.  No way to know how often a Judge has compelled Apple to release information.  No way to tell what information was released either."
"*Apple, we'll say anything to earn your ~~trust~~ bucks.*The all the relevant OS (maybe not app) data is encrypted using the hardware of the iPhone. Even with an image of the device, this cannot be decrypted. After 10 tries on the device itself, (if feature is turned on) the iPhone will erase itself."
"Apple CANNOT release certain information about NSA requests, but is actively engaging in a lawsuit against the GVMT to release more information. "
"Did you even read the link?> Apple doesn't provide the numbers for the national security-related requests either."
"There's a link right under that nice little circle to their [transparency reports](http://www.apple.com/privacy/transparency-reports/).

In other words, Apple can take your data, have you pay for hardware, software and services, and then forget about your data and still make a tidy profit. Google cannot store your data for free and not look at it in various ways. Your data is Google's business plan.I only use my data for porn so have fun with that appleYou know what they say....

"Sure, them too. Dude, he said 'major' company. Microsoft handles like pocket change. /sMicrosoft runs a search business, and is heavily into big data with their Azure business.

"FtfyI don't know if you guys remember Lavabit.Lavabit was a small company that most people hadn't heard of before they were shut down. It didn't take much for the government to beat them into submission."
"Apple, on the other hand, is an extremely large, wealthy, and well known company. They can't be easily pushed around like Lavabit was.That is not how national security ops work. They don't push on companies -- they go to specific employees who have the ability to do what they need, they hand them a NSL that says you can't discuss this with your supervisor, staff, company legal, management, board, spouse or family -- and you can only discuss it with your attorney far enough for your attorney to tell you whether or not this is a legal NSL, you can't discuss with your attorney what we are asking you to do. If you breach this, you'll be tried for treason, which is the only crime in the constitution, which also happens to have the only punishment in the constitution : death."
"Until they do it to an employee like Snowden and it blows up in their face.Can we audit the code?Sure, just switch to GNU/Linux.This is excellent news for Apple users and those on Android and Blackberry as well. As this becomes a marketing point, the security can become more ubiquitous."
"This is, if I understand it, saying that your core personal data, not your apps, are under your passcode restriction. Whether this means they are encrypted by default I'm not sure, but would love to see the detail on. But it's a great step to take. Android has offered full disk encryption for a while, but setting it up takes time, and it is not used by many users since it is off by default. Google changing this to default on, or opt-out on initial setup, and to stand with Apple for security, would be a great step to take as well.> this becomes a marketing point"
"If you read [Tim Cook's letter on the parent page](http://www.apple.com/privacy/) he definitely takes a shot at Google."
">A few years ago, users of Internet services began to realize that when an online service is free, you're not the customer. You're the product. But at Apple, we believe a great customer experience shouldn't come at the expense of your privacy."
">Our business model is very straightforward: We sell great products. We don't build a profile based on your email content or web browsing habits to sell to advertisers. We don't monetize the information you store on your iPhone or in iCloud. And we don't read your email or your messages to get information to market to you. Our software and services are designed to make our devices better. Plain and simple. They like to make this claim of non-monetization a strong point, but it is however something we have no data to verify, and somewhat misleading. Notice how he enumerates the service they exclude, and takes pot shots at others like net ad tracking, etc. "
"Quite to the contrary, we know they track your purchasing habits, music tastes, profiles, etc, through iTunes purchases and App store usage to tailor your recommendations and increase sell through. The careful wording here makes it sound as if they don't participate in these practices. But the truth is if they did not, their level of service would be massively inferior by this point. "
"No, the truth is they do monetize your activity and your actions, just not your static data perhaps. Since there is no Facebook/G+ Apple version, they just leave your contacts be. To that extent, I don't really think Android, natively, monetizes afterwards. Only were you to use google plus, and contribute to public profiles via public reviews, would they benefit in that way by sharing those reviews with not just contacts, but explicitly approved friends. But if you are just syncing contacts on a Google Account without a G+ profile, no. Your pictures are useless to them outside of if you choose to contribute them publicly to a project. or letting you add to famous locations for google maps via geotags."
"Google also doesn't build personal profiles based on email content or web browsing. Their adwords system is tailored message by message, and this has been covered extensively as for why it's automated and safe. As for and web browsing habits ...yea that's BS. You can use any browser you like, cookies from hundreds of organizations are still tracking you. Apple included, just maybe not directly."
"Again, I do think their statement here, and the choice to encrypt/protect these pieces of content is good. But the digs from the letter are just petty and distract from what they are complicit in. Which is what it's intended to do I guess.> Quite to the contrary, we know they track your purchasing habits, music tastes, profiles, etc, through iTunes purchases and App store usage to tailor your recommendations and increase sell through."
"This sounds like you're actually making a point until you look at what the words actually mean."
"Yes, Apple keeps track of things that *you buy from Apple*.  If you go to the iTunes store and buy Superman, Apple is going to know.  There is no way for Apple to sell you Superman *without* knowing, since they have to, you know, send it to you. All vendors do that, and it's not particularly controversial.  The library can tell you what books you have checked out, as far as that goes."
"What makes Apple different from Google, etc., is that Apple does not have access to things where you are not specifically asking them for something.  If I send you an e-mail, Apple can't read it.  If I send my mom a text, Apple can't read it.  That's the difference, and it's a huge difference.  "
"No one cares that you bought superman."
"A lot of people might care about what you put in an e-mail."
"How quickly we forget Ping!Here's a summary for many of the comments here: I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY SAY! THEY'RE STILL WORKING FOR THE NSA AND THE POLICE! DON'T TRUST THEM!"
"As usual:"
"Complainers: Don't trust them, they decrypt your data and turn it over to the police under court order. "
"Apple: You're right, so now we're going to remove the ability for us to decrypt your data, your data belongs to you. "
"Complainers: We don't believe you. We wanted you to change it, but we will never believe that you changed it. We want proof, even though we'll never believe this proof. No matter what you do, we'll always move the goal-posts.That's one of the reasons why what the NSA did is such a big deal; it's much easier to lose trust than to rebuild it. They made true what in the past was only deemed plausible by conspiracy nuts; in order for US companies to regain the consumers' trust they need to do something proportionally extreme, and not just put out a note in PR speak pretending to claim it's all better now.This really pisses me off about reddit."
"If you don't believe it, do some research. Half of reddit doesn't even know what encryption isApple could cure cancer and /r/technology would find a way to bitch about it.In all seriousness, how long until the government makes them provide a backdoor?Who needs a company to intentionally place backdoors when governments allocate ungodly amounts of budgets towards hire swarms of security research teams to find exploits that the corporations and security teams are unaware of? ie: StuxnetI'd be amazed if they didn't already have one.  It's not like companies are allowed or willing to tell everyone about their government ordered back doors.The NSA already has backdoors & root access to any and all apple products allegedly Microsoft too.."

"Here is an [Article by ars technica on the subject](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/09/apple-expands-data-encryption-under-ios-8-making-handover-to-cops-moot/)"
"According to the article, Messages, Mail, Calendar, Contacts and Photos are protected by AES-256 encryption (info: [1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard),[2](http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/2251/how-secure-is-aes-256),[3](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18847580/aes128-vs-aes256-using-bruteforce),[4](http://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/1x50xl/time_and_energy_required_to_bruteforce_a_aes256/))"
"Also The passcode is entangled with the device's UID, so brute-force attempts must be performed on the device under attack presumably, the encryption key is generated using the devices unique ID, meaning that to make a feasible brute force of it, you would have to have physical access to the device."
"Of course, if you use the default 4 digit passcode, its far easier to break into assuming they have physical access to the device, but this can easily be changed to a passcode of arbitrary length using the full keyboard for the full protection."
"Since this encryption key is made using your password, it is not stored with apple, therefore they can physically not access it (see AES info) To them, the data will appear random."
"Where this goes with iCloud is anyone's guess once you choose to put things up there, but since that information can be accessed by signing in online using your apple account, it's stored in a form that CAN be read by apple - so if you want your stuff secure, don't sync it over iCloud and use the cable instead."
"On the other hand, what you should be angry about is their new iBeacon. Basicly, apple made a new MAC address randomising feature to stop you form being tracked through public places using your wifi and MAC address (info: [1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address),[2](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/06/ios8-to-stymie-trackers-and-marketers-with-mac-address-randomization/),[3](http://www.itworld.com/it-management/336828/attention-shoppers-retailers-can-follow-you-around-mall-way-web-trackers-do-onl)).

"This requires the device to be jailbroken or booted up with a special ramdisk which only works AFAIK on the iPhone 4 or older devices only."
">Of course, if you use the default 4 digit passcode, its far easier to break into assuming they have physical access to the device, but this can easily be changed to a passcode of arbitrary length using the full keyboard for the full protection."
"You can set the device to wipe itself after 10 attempts and if you use the Mobile Device Configuration Utility you can set it as low as 1 attempt before the device wipes itself.If they truly cannot access my data without my password this would mean if I lose my password, Apple cannot reset it and let me back into my data."
"Is this the case? Wouldn't Apple warn us not to expect recovery if this were the case?You can use 2 step authentication an password recovery tools. But that is always an issue. People can then phish it from you."
"There isn't a magic bullet for this yet. This is an issue every company has. At least Apple devices are coming out with really good and really fast biometrics. That is a step int eh right direction.> You can use 2 step authentication an password recovery tools."
"How? If Apple can send my password to me, then that means they had it all along and could have used it to decrypt my data. They claim they can't do that, that it is actually impossible for them to decrypt it."
"> At least Apple devices are coming out with really good and really fast biometrics. That is a step int eh right direction."
"I love TouchID, it is fast and good. But it doesn't produce a secret key or password from your finger. It can only convince itself you are you. So you ask it to verify you are you, and it says yes, it's him. Over the net this is useless, there is no way to verify that the phone isn't lying and just saying you're you.Apple's 2-step recovery has a rescue key that they give you when you set it up. If you lose that and your password, you're boned."
"As for TouchID, I don't know for sure, but I assume that the secure enclave can work like a smart card. So your fingerprint is just unlocking that; the enclave could have a private key.The website linked actually is referring to the passcode on the iOS Device. Apple has no way of knowing what your passcode is and if you have forgot it then you will lose everything unless you have previously synced it with a computer. You can then only use that computer to recover your data."
"http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1212"
"By password it sounds like you're talking about an Apple ID/iCloud account. Which is a different issue, obviously Apple can access data stored on its servers and when required by law to give information over can do so.  Props to Apple. Unfortunately this is important in the version of America we live in at the moment."
"Wait till they get the Yahoo! treatment.What's the story about Yahoo?http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/09/15/you-think-youve-got-bills-government-could-have-fined-yahoo-trillions-of-dollars/?tid=rssfeedthey were going to be fined $250k per day if they didn't comply with the nsa.IIRC, Yahoo! was fighting the government over server access, but was under a gag order about it - they weren't allowed to tell anyone that it was happening.How did the news become public then?the gag was for yahoo employees, yahoo terminated one and told them to blab. from what I've gathered.The whole point is Apple literally can't turn over the data even if strongarmed, since they don't have access to it. The difference being that Yahoo had all of your data on their servers unencrypted (since their entire business model--like Google's, Facebook's, etc.--is based on having access to your data).They have the data that is encrypted. The NSA won't have much trouble getting around your 4 digit passcode.Except it locks you out after 10 attempts and it can also be set to wipe your data after that 10th attempt as well. No, they cannot brute force your 4-digit passcode.iOS allows for up to 37 characters with 77 possible alphanumeric/symbol characters in passcode.Up to.My name is moses89 and I say things with out knowing the factsAll the facts are on the Apple website. They literally dodge around the subject by claiming they can't un-encrypt the data. Do you have any idea what the NSA does? Code-breaking is what they do if you can't use Google.I was more pointing to your 4 digit remark. It doesn't matter, there is no evidence to suggest the NSA is capable of decrypting 128 bit encryption, which is used by iMessage, which supposedly takes 1.02x10^18 years to crack if you used a supercomputer.Ok, all the flaming aside, I have to confess I don't understand why the 4-digit code is secure. I understand that the real decryption key is 128-bit, but wouldn't brute-forcing the 4-digit pin give them access to the key?"
"I'm not trying to feed the flames here, I would genuinely like to learn about the other protections in place to prevent this. If you click the link on the top left that says Privacy Built In it tells you more. As far as I am aware, iMessage is encryped with AES 128, and apple doesn't have access to the private key to decrypt it in transit, which means the only way it is decrypted is by either of the users devices. If a government agency wanted to access the message in plaintext, they would have to access your device, and the only way to do that would be through your passcode, which they could brute force I suppose, but I believe they would need to actually physically have the device. "
"I could be very wrong, this is just my understanding.Ok thanks for the info!"
"Just curious does anyone know why they went with 128? I thought 256 was the current standard? Can't they reset your password if you happen to forget it? Couldn't they get access that way?Not if you enable 2 factor authentication. They give you a key that if you lose your trusted device that key can unlock your info. If you lose that key and your trusted device... to bad, your data is lost.That's more reassuring.They can't turn over this data; what makes you think that this is the data they would be turning over?What makes you think NSA hasn't backdoored the encryption Apple is using now as well?Because what you just said isn't even a fucking coherent sentence."
"Backdoored the encryption is something that... just isn't a thing. AES256 which is the standard for Apple (it might actually be stronger now but since ~2007 that I know of) there simply isn't a way to brute force it. You cant get around it, and if you knew a lick about encryption you would know this.Other than from their word, do we really know that is what they're using?"

"And even if they are indeed using the best cryptography possible, that means nothing if the key is leaked. And besides, your data needs to be decrypted on the phone for you to access it, who knows what else is running in there?Well once you tear the operating system apart and don't see any evidence of anything running in userland (where it would have to operate for information to be sent out without your consent) it becomes evident that it's not a lie Couldn't they for example have a separate system hiding inside the chip packages, sniffing the RAM and sending commands to the modem and stuff?"

"That is interesting though, have people actually completely reverse engineered the entire iOS (including the latest version), and know for sure there isn't any part of it that stays dormant until special conditions arise?Bullshit. Anything that can be done, can be undone. Period.From the article, Our commitment to customer privacy doesn't stop because of a government information request."
"Really....because Apple initially denied compliance with the Government request for information, then fought to keep their actions secret, and now they seem to be trying to hide their compliance....."
"It's interesting that the 'new normal' is that we have no privacy at all, and it's out of the ordinary that a company can 'no longer decrypt X for law enforcement'.Other companies try to build a profile about you using a complete history of everywhere you've been, usually because they're targeting you for advertisers. Since our business doesn't depend on advertising, we have no interest in doing this -- and we couldn't even if we wanted to. <<< Google burn.Honeyypottwell, who's gonna do it then? it's not like only apple can hack their own devicesFYI - Mobile Carriers are required by law to provide access to their networks with intent to listen to phone conversations and other information called Lawful Intercept aka CALEA. There are standards written to allow this access built into the machines that transport your voice/video/data. So just assume that Govt. agencies have access to your data if they want it. "
"Here's some brief public info - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawful_interception"
"Don't put anything in electronic form that you wouldn't want the Govt to  be able to see, nothing is completely secure not even the Govt's own data.If they're still backing up to iCloud, what's the point?Apple did something I agree with!You have absolutely no reason to believe Apple or any company for that matter."
"They are in business for themselves, they could give 2 turds what you dislike as long you keep coming back for more;  lies or not.Gotta say, I'm impressed. I'm glad to see this kind of thing happen, and I hope others follow suit. It seems pretty similar to Mega. "
"If you ask me, the only way to create a safe and secure future is to make it impossible for government actions to go undetected.lol we can no longer decrypt for law enforcement.  Which is why we've built in a back door so they can do it themselves.  They don't need it when everything is backed up on apple servers.Not sure if I understand this."
"Does this imply that photo's, messages, etc will be encrypted on the I cloud servers under your personal phone password also?  Isn't that where the celeb photo leaker accessed those pics?The celeb leaker used phishing emails, brute force, and weak users passwords to enter the accounts It was a failure of general password security, not iCloud specifically. Also some of the hacked celebrities used Android phones. Many people believe that these photos were obtained by many many different people over a long period of time and shared in small hacking circles. One of those people int he circle leaked a large portion of the collection. No real details are known because nobody has been caught.Thanks for the clarifications.  I hadn't followed the details of the celeb leaks.All I know is that 4chan guy did it. I'm pretty sure he was a sys admin.But who is this 4 chan?I bet he deleted system32 to make his computer faster so he could hack all that stuff so quickly. He could have just downloaded Google Ultron... so much simpler!They can no longer decrypt iPhones for the police .... But the NSA still can.  Leaked documents have shown that hackers or the NSA can get remote root access to any Apple device."

"The document says they can steal your phone, jailbreak it over USB, and install spyware on it. You have seriously misconstrued the meaning of those documents."
"After the first iPhone release (June 29th, 2007), amateurs were able to jailbreak it by July 10th, 2007. That is when the first jailbreak was released."
"The documents you refer to are describing a jailbreak for the first iPhone. Which was trivially easy, as evidenced by amateurs jailbreaking it in less than 2 weeks. The NSA probably did it in a day or two."
"Again... this is literally just a jailbreak for the original iPhone."
"Saying that the NSA can still access the iPhone using this method is like claiming that you can jailbreak iOS 8 using the jailbreak for the first iPhone."
"National Security Orders"
"The government could tell apple they have to tell people that they are safe while the government has direct access, and if Apple goes against it their executives would go to jail and Apple would be fined until compliance.  "

"Edit:  I believe it was more than 10 years ago when the state had all the chipmakers put backdoors in the hardware..  So I have no idea how one protects their privacy these days, short of being Amish."
"I've been happily using Apple products since the 80s, and I'd love to believe that they would only build products & services that would be inaccessible to anyone other than the rightful owner.  However, for a few years now it seems all products and services are intel gathering products and services..  Not only for the state, but for commercial gain.  Products seem to be made first for our owners, and then for us in so much that it gets us to actually want to buy/use them."
"I purchased my last Apple product when iPhone 5 was released.  I'm going to make the move to Debian as soon as I get the time, and I have no idea what I'll do for a smartphone.

"So if they regulate the data going into a phone, then why should they worry about encryption?A patent prevents *others* from using a technology without your permission.  That is all it does.  It doesn't imply or require you to implement it.Yep. They have thousands of patents, most of them unused."
"They have patents for things like two connectors on an iPad, a hybrid e-ink display, TV remote control with motion controls, etc etc. None of these are in any of their products."

"I searched some of the links and the only place I can find those quotes from Apple is in news articles linking back to that same piece."
"I would happily look into this more... but so far there doesn't seem to be any real information in that link.They were probably legally allowed to tell this lie to us too. > On devices running iOS 8, your personal data such as photos, messages (including attachments), email, contacts, call history, iTunes content, notes, and reminders is placed under the protection of your passcode. Unlike our competitors, Apple cannot bypass your passcode and therefore cannot access this data. So it's not technically feasible for us to respond to government warrants for the extraction of this data from devices in their possession running iOS 8."
"This is very unspecific. What do they mean 'cannot bypass', and by what means did they have to 'bypass' it in the first place before iOS8? "
"Not 'technically feasibile' just means it's 'formally' not available, but it doesn't satisfy nor meet completely their assumed need of the user's privacy. An example of informal feasibility in this context is: Apple having remote access can still access the user's data when they decrypt it either into temporary or volatile storage. In order for the user to secure their private data, assuming this passcode is an encryption key, from remote view by Apple is to not view the data at all on the device, making it a very poor platform for privately held information.less than 0.00385%"
"of customers had data disclosed due to government information requests."
"that means 385 at every 10 m accounts . let's say there are 500 m iphones [sold](http://ipod.about.com/od/glossary/f/how-many-iphones-sold.htm) there are 19.250 acounts data give away. not counting macs or ipads or double accounts[deleted][deleted]This is perfectly inline with their business model (selling products to consumers). They have no desire to see what you're searching for, your email, your location, etc. They wouldn't even want to pay for the server space to store that, since it's literally useless to them."
"It's in their best interest to do what users want (which in this case is privacy), since users are the ones lining their pockets. Google, Facebook, etc. depends on advertisers to make money, and so, they depend on having access to as much of their users' data as possible. Like it's been said before, you're not Google's customer, you're their product.Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight.>Less than 0.00385% of customers had data disclosed due to government information requests."
"63.2 (million iphone users) * (0.00385%) = 243,320 users who have had there information disclosed."
"That's a lot of people...  More than 0.00385% would lead you to believe.  Math is hard for you, right?You did your math wrong. .00385%=.0000385. It's really 2,432. Not to mention we're talking users, not devices.It would be 2433.2 people who had their information disclosed."
"You didn't account for it being presented as %."
"The 0.2 probably comes from the rounding factors invovled.Shouldn't the encryption be so robust that they couldn't do it without a password anyways?So can the government request the encrypted data and then unencrypt it themselves? If they have access to RSA keys, it makes certain schemes easier right? > If they have access to RSA keys, it makes certain schemes easier right?"
"What keys are they supposed to have access to? The public keys, sure, but that doesn't help much.How many comment without even reading the article. The title here is not 100% what is written there.Am I naive for thinking that Apple really has been making a 180 as a company lately?Yeah, yeah. And if we will have new Swoden we will learn that they actually can and do.Can? Or Will?Can.Kind of a huge difference, no?Yeah now law enforcement can do it themselves. Edited it in. Thats all great and dandy, but law enforcement will go to your mobile carrier first anyway.  Verizon/At&T have all your info the gov want to see, and I'm pretty sure they dish it out quite liberally. Of course they won't, they'll give the software to do it to law enforcement. Apple won't technically have to duo anything.This appears to be good news, although I admit I am skeptical that there is some non-obvious loophole in these carefully chosen words."
"Also, just because user data on iOS 8 is encrypted and protected with a users pin doesn't mean Apple can't be ordered to cough up the encrypted data along with a key protected by a pin that in most cases is <6 digits. They could also be ordered to start logging all users pins tomorrow and wet would never know. I'm not saying this happens or that if I was the NSA this is even the best way to acquire this sort of data, buts it's just food for thought. Don't most people keep their data in the iCloud anyway?So law enforcement can still tap into transmitted data but can't obtain perviously sent data. Am I understanding that correctly, Ebounding?Yeah and I'm never going to masturbate again..."
"If someone asked apple they'd do it.But how about 4chan?Suddenly, the Congress approves Huawei to sell their equipment in the US.> So it's not technically feasible for us to respond to government warrants for the extraction of this data from devices in their possession running iOS 8."
"Not technically feasible is not same as can't.  And if Apple can't, that doesn't mean someone else can't.What basically Apple says is  we can not decrypt your device unless it's NSA request >  National security-related requests are not considered Device Requests or Account Requests and are reported in a separate category altogether."
"..."
"> So it's not technically feasible for us to respond to government warrants for the extraction of this data from devices in their possession running iOS 8."
"So will they be responding to National security-related requests?  Will it be feasible then?Glad to see its in, at least its a step forward, i know the boss will be happy to be able to say that at least :)about dam time, they should of NEVER been able to in the first place. I can't wait for a year or two from now to find out there were NSA and law enforcement back doors implemented in the code all along. It's ok everybody, the Police will just have unlimited attempts to guess your password instead.Apple might not be apple to decrypt the iPhone but NSA still might be able to decrypt it...I knew there was a reason I wasnt comfortable with snapchatI wonder if apple can yank this page when it turns out the government can access iphone 8 data.This doesn't do diddly squat to protect your iOS device [from this forensic software used quite often illegally by police.](http://www.accessdata.com/solutions/digital-forensics/mobile-phone-examiner)How do we know they didn't get one of those secret court orders forcing them to advertise this while leaving a gaping backdoor for the NSA and shit?Apple: Quick, upgrade to ios 8, it's more secure .... silly consumers, after they upgrade we can decrypt everything now, mwaahaha, they'll be none the wiser... oh crap the keyboard is still on!In addition, Apple has never worked with any government agency from any country to create a back door in any of our products or services.... Yet they have had a backdoor up until IOS7?I'm sure that this is VERY hard for Apple to do....*sarcasm*."
"If law enforcement is trying to hack into a phone or account, then the provider will add a backdoor to their iOS update.  It's not Apple's responsibility, nor has it ever been their responsibility.  It's naive to think that Apple is doing anybody a favor. Let's see what [these guys](http://www.cellebrite.com/mobile-forensics/products/standalone/ufed-touch-ultimate) say about that.  Apply might not be able to decrypt the phones but that doesn't mean that nobody else can...Apple schooling the world in marketing yet again, well done.Will they cave like blackberry did? Their early claim to fame was security but in order to sell phones in India the government required access. After a short standoff BB handed over the keys. Hopefully the political climate is different now and apple will stand firm. Also, hopefully they're not just lying about it.Don't the carriers still have most of this data themselves? lol sorry apple I don't believe you. I would love to. but no. can't the US government has you by the balls and will make your life hell if you don't provide back door access to your customers. the best you can do is Lobby to have the Infringing laws abolished.National security-related requests are not considered Device Requests or Account Requests and are reported in a separate category altogether."
"Okay, so there's giant loophole #1.> Unlike our competitors, Apple cannot bypass your passcode and therefore cannot access this data."
"Ummmmm Blackberry has been like this forever. I'm pretty sure that Android's storage encryption is the same if used properly from the device only standpoint...."
">So it's not technically feasible for us to respond to government warrants for the extraction of this data from devices in their possession running iOS 8. "
"The caveat being they don't need to extract the data from the actual device if the data is stored remotely on iCloud, or your apple e-mail account, etc. They do have the ability to decrypt and present those under demand of warrant.Bullshit>If we are legally compelled to divulge any information and it is not counterproductive to the facts of the case, we provide notice to the customer ***when allowed*** and deliver the narrowest set of information possible in response."
"It doesn't matter what Apple believes or promises; the flawed legal system makes their promises irrelevant.just don't put your shit in iCloud FTFY"
"We can no longer decrypt iPhones for law enforcement but we will decrypt for politicians. Everyone seems to be pretty tickled about this, mostly because there's some assumption of malice on the part of law enforcement..."
"About a year ago, working with my department's computer crimes investigator, we were able to arrest and convict a rapist based on data obtained (with a search warrant) from his iPhone.  The phone contained inculpatory evidence including pictures and text messages.  Without this data, it's unlikely we would have been able to give the victim the solace of knowing that we had captured the person who had violated her."
"So just keep the other side of things in mind.  This is the sort of thing that could get me to go back to iPhone. Except by the time it's time for a new phone, it'll be industry standard. But thanks, Apple! /r/digitaleagleWow, this might make me finally purchase an iPhone.Your turn Google I call bullshit. No one is allowed, by law, to admit to helping law enforcement when the government claims, without evidence or warrants, that it's a matter of national security."
"In addition Apple was forced to admit they have a backdoor after denying they have one.  "
"Denial: http://mashable.com/2014/07/22/ios-backdoor-security/  "
"Admission: http://www.zdziarski.com/blog/?p=3466  >less than 0.00385% of customers had data disclosed due to government information requests."
"The scary thing is that at 300 MM iphones, that is still 1,115,000 customers who were affected - yikes.Your math is of, its 11,550Where as I think this is a good step, it's really just a hurdle, they could brute force their own system if they really wanted to, even if they've locked themselves out.These warrants from law enforcement are scary, and americans should worry about them and demand further transparency.  "
"I used to work for an online web host and would handle such requests from various local law enforcement agencies, and agencies such as the FBI and Secret Service.  These agencies would request all emails and personal information we had on file for the customer.  The worst part however, was that we were explicitly denied from notifying the customer that we were handing over their personal information and emails to the government."
"Americans need to demand more freedom for companies to notify customers when they give out data.800,000,000 ios devices in the world.  .00385% of that is 30,800. Thats the high number if each device represents a customer. "
"However if each Apple ID represents a customer, Apple has 500,000,000 Apple ids out there of which would be 19,250 information requests would have been complied with. "
"Thats a lot of legally valid information requests.And then millions of murderers used iPhones to avoid prosecution.what a load of crockheard this crap before. They all crumple once uncle sam's black op thugs swing fees around. Or they'll just break in.Remember that one time Apple wouldn't unlock a dead mother's iPad for her sons who inherited it after she passed?"
"They really do want to take your secrets to the grave.Not feasible does NOT mean impossible just not easily doneThe other reason why they can no longer decrypt the devices is because of Apple Pay. Decrypting the devices would give law enforcement access to social security, checking/savings account & routing numbers, pin and security codes, AND fingerprint biometric data/metadata."
"That would be a fucking shitstorm of apocalyptic proportions for Apple, as that's a violation of SO MANY different privacy laws, it would bury the company."
"I mean sure, the government via various agencies and the NSA respectively, already has all that. But this is a private corporation and they don't have sovereign immunity. So they can't and won't decrypt devices, they like being a corporation that can make money; they don't want to be a bankrupt agency.What's really important here is that the company that essentially kickstarted the entire mobile web doesn't make pages that are usable on a phone...  :P"
"Wait.. So Apple are good guys?And in iOS 9 the decrypt ability comes back. Along with a gag order forbidding mentioning it.That yellow wet substance that is wetting your head, it's rain, honest.Sounds like they have still processed quite a few law enforcement requests, just shy of 20,000 (500 million iphones sold times 0.000385 disclosure rate equals 19,250) Funny how math can mask things.OK, so for those who don't know how to read statistics/numbers, that percentage is out of all devices. When you look at the numbers where data were revealed out of the number of requests, it's a much different story."
"In the U.S. 83% of the requests got some information... "
"http://images.apple.com/privacy/docs/government-information-requests-20140630.pdfThat's awesome! I don't think anyone 5 years ago could have predicted that Apple would emerge as some sort of privacy vanguard, but it's increasingly evident that their attitude is significantly constructive to the cause of personal electronic privacy and security. TLDR?CIA FBI NSA, No problem in fact already done and indexed for you - here you go.If only they had a service so I could get those deleted mails back after I accidentally delete them.  ...^but^please^ignore^the^icloud^backups.As someone who moved away from iPhones for many reasons and has never looked back...color me interested.Apple will still have the ability -- and the legal responsibility -- to turn over user data stored elsewhere, such as in its iCloud service, which typically includes backups of photos, videos, e-mail communications, music collections and more. Users who want to prevent all forms of police access to their information will have to adjust settings in a way that blocks data from flowing to iCloud."

"That page of weasel words was so much easier on the eyes than an auditable source code repository.  Thanks, Apple!No worries, the nsa will decrypt it for you,  no problem. Bullshit.  Who could ever trust Apple?  Oh, we just decided that we don't like that previously approved app that you spent 3 years developing because we decided to start developing something remotely similar that might be part of a future update so we're going to remove it from the AppStore without warning.  Sorry!Bullshit."
"Major tech companies are required to provide NSA backdoors through security due to secret FISA court rulings.Shiiit.  I think I might have gotten the wrong phone....... unless they installed facebook.  But that's facebook's problem, and no longer apple'sIphone...a crimelords phone."
"Jokes aside it's a nice step forward.Yeah right.Bullshit.  "
"They're saying they can't to appease their customers, but that doesn't make it true.That's great for marketing.  Tell folks their phones are finally private.  I've seen folks jumping at buying an iPhone because of this fact.  But... iCloud is still accessible for these information requests.  I can't really speak to how often folks back their phones up to iCloud, but I do see Apple pushing for more iCloud integration, so information is still available for requesting."
"Apple says that 7% of requests are made on iCloud/iTunes and the rest on devices.  Well if law enforcement can't access a device, what in the hell do you think the next step they're going to take is?"
"Another thing, they classify national security requests under a separate category which doesn't impact the numbers shown for requests.  What qualifies as a national security request?  As ambiguous as the NSA and other intelligence agencies are with their reasoning for investigating folks, who knows how to interpret that.  Why *wouldn't* Apple use that to their advantage in a marketing campaign?"
"So why does Apple address the public formally about device encryption and specifically mention device request statistics?  It's to show the market that law enforcement has a huge need to get into your devices and there is now a way to protect yourselves from this threat.  iOS8.  More sales for Apple!  Meanwhile, they progressively integrate more cloud features to your phone that *is* accessible to law enforcement *but* law enforcement has to pay for each request.  More revenue for Apple!"
"It's deceptive to me.well if some random shmuck can hack into thier servers for some nude celebrity pics im sure the government can come and go as they please.. good try apple.. your just as stupid as your customersYou're*Do you pride yourself on being ignorant or is it purely natural?Good thing they can't, then.The celebrities photos got out most likely through them having stupid passwords and even more stupid account recovery question answers, not an actual hack.I guess this is just like how Apple fans think that their computers are Virus ProofThey certainly do have much less malware than competitors, that probably helps too.Thank you for sharing this.They can't, but someone else can.Prove it.The last time they did this, someone called them out. I'm sure all the three-letter agencies are still able to.iPhones are encrypted?Some data on them, yes. It's complicated; there are several levels of security. Read the white paper they did about it.WeKey word law enforcementWhether it's a lie or not. They could lie and still have nothing to worry about if found out. Too big to fail. Anything short of their products becoming sentient and killing the buyer wouldn't be enough to sink Apple.BSHang on, Starting with iOS 8? Just recently I heard Tim Cook claim that Apple never decrypts anything for the government. If this new claim is true, then Apple is full of shit.Plot twist, it's because the government can do it themselves. Honestly, itsounds like a bunch of propaganda to get you to download iOS8This doesn't matter- Apple is a willing participant in NSA's PRISM, so this is a hollow, meaningless gesture to lure users into a false sense if security.Twist: they canDoes anyone actually believe this?[deleted]A tiny percentage of our millions of accounts is affected..."
"Percentage is singular.Unless the NSA asks them to.SureWe believe youThey say, knowing full well their security procedures are as difficult to break as a 4 year old wet paper bag.This is a bunch of doubletalk/marketing garbageApple's Cupertino facility bombed by crazed right-wing terrorist"
"Apple announces it will continue to decrypt iPhones for the US government, reversing previous decisionI wouldn't be surprised if this is just all smoke and mirrors from Apple to get people to trust their products. Apple: That'll help them forget about the iCloud episode.jennifer lawrence loves thisApple - helping the terrorists win since 2014."
"/s?The ironic thing is google has been doing this since its launch. As soon as you have a password lock there is no way of breaking though it. There is a story of police trying to break into a pimps phone to uncover a prostitution ring but even the police couldn't do it.This just in, ISIS confirms they will be getting the family plan for 5,000 devices running iOS 8 Do you believe this? Of course you can't Apple /wink.If one believes in apples advertising, they will believe this bullshit, too."
"Even if apple did not install any government backdoors in this release, NSA, FBI, CIA, and other three-letter-agencies will knock down the proper doors in Cupertino and see that such mishaps won't happen again."
"Apple is in no way more secure than other US-based companies. It's the law, obey or else.And, like in every professional police state, the companies get gag oders, so neither the victim nor the public will ever know how the government abused its power.I get a sliight feeling you either didn't read or don't understand the article.I read it. And I call it bullshit. When the feds bang at apples doors, apple *will* provide. And, as per order, won't tell the customer. Apple may be snotty, but they are not above the law, and they want to stay in business."
"When they are ordered to provide back doors and shut up about them, they will do. And they will definitely not advertise this.>We have also never allowed any government access to our servers. And we never will."
"For sure they will allow access to information when coerced through CALEA and other court orders. Given their post-Jobs track record, I'd imagine information will be turned over when presented with NSLs, FISC orders, and participation through secret gov't programmes will also continue. Don't forget apple participated in the PRISM program. Not allowing access to our servers doesn't necessarily exclude copying information from our servers to servers owned by other entities. Basically, what I'm saying is don't trust privacy by policy, trust privacy by design. And don't trust companies with track records of privacy violations just because they preach privacy rights when they're in vogue."

">All content requests require a search warrant. If we are legally compelled to divulge any information and it is not counterproductive to the facts of the case, we provide notice to the customer when allowed "
"So, content requests require a warrant, but metadata..."
"Oh, pretty please, can we notify your suspect, [insert agency]?"
">and deliver the narrowest set of information possible in response. National security-related requests are not considered Device Requests or Account Requests and are reported in a separate category altogether."
"Considering the vast majority of (unconstitutional) bulk data collection occurs under National Security requests, much more information is needed about such requests."
">On devices running iOS 8, your personal data such as photos, messages (including attachments), email, contacts, call history, iTunes content, notes, and reminders is placed under the protection of your passcode. "
"Wow. Such protection, much security! What percentage of users use a four digit PIN? Definitely the vast majority. Seems pretty trivial to pull that data down and brute force it at the government's request."
">Unlike our competitors, Apple cannot bypass your passcode and therefore cannot access this data. So it's not technically feasible for us to respond to government warrants for the extraction of this data from devices in their possession running iOS 8."
"That says nothing about the data apple already has and continues to collect on you. That also doesn't prevent any remote attacks from a gov't agency to get additional content."
">A tiny percentage of our millions of accounts is affected by national security-related requests. In the first six months of 2014, we received 250 or fewer of these requests. Though we would like to be more specific, by law this is the most precise information we are currently allowed to disclose."
"So, we can't know how many users are affected by theses requests, as they are usually not individual requests. For all we know it is 250 requests for information on 10 people or 10,000 people."
">less than 0.00385% of customers had data disclosed due to government information requests."
"The number looks good on its face, but is an information request classified as device/account request or the seperate national security-related request or both? "
"I'm a bit skeptical and perhaps cynical, but that's only the case because the constitutional violations of the gov't that were only able to take place with collusion from companies like apple.> So, we can't know how many users are affected by theses requests, as they are usually not individual requests. For all we know it is 250 requests for information on 10 people or 10,000 people."
"Looking at past transparency reports from Apple and also from Google, it looks like the number of accounts affected is generally in the same band as the number of requests, or in the next band up. E.g., Apple reported for the first six months of 2013 0-249 requests which affected 0-249 accounts."
"Google is similar. They have gotten 0-999 requests in each of the last 11 six month periods. For 7 of these periods, those affected 0-999 accounts. For 4 of those periods, 1000-1999 accounts were affected.Android phones have encryption as well do they not? It has to be enabled from the settings menu.Not by defaultThere's always a way....Does the word no longer imply that they admit that they used to?They used to be *able* to.Give us a backdoor or we're changing the rules on offshore banking.Don't change the rules on offshore banking"
"Or we'll stop our campaign financing/r/hailcorporateHaha I'm calling bullshit on this!I wonder if this will be the job of the *carriers* now and this is just apples way of saying well it wasn't us"
"The carriers can't unlock your device. They don't have the access to the OS like that. I don't know if you understand how this works...All well and good for the consumer of Apple products but it comes at the cost of toxic work conditions for the Chinese factory workers and toxic environments for the towns nearby.Yeah because it's not like Foxconn makes anything for other major companies. Just Acer, Amazon, Blackberry, Cisco, Dell, Google, HP, Microsoft, Motorola, Nintendo, Nokia, Sony, Toshiba and Vizio."
"But shame on Apple specifically! Shame on them for picking the manufacturer that makes almost 40% of the worlds consumer electronics.Yes, shame on a company that puts profits above the working conditions of it's laborers!Because it's not like Apple asked the Fair Labor Association to audit their suppliers or anything. Oh wait... Wait they did: After enduring weeks of criticism over the working conditions at the Chinese factories that make its products, Apple has asked the Fair Labor Association to look into the matter. [link](http://gizmodo.com/5884585/apple-is-letting-auditors-into-its-horrible-chinese-plants)From your own linked article, Apple notes that it has conducted more than 500 audits of its own facilities since 2006, including 40 audits at Foxconn plants."
"Either way, the point I was trying to make to your original comment was that it's not only Apple, so why should they take 100% of the blame? "
"I don't see people posting comments like yours in every Microsoft/Google/Sony/Nintento/Whatever thread. Just Apple.So they farm out the encryption to third party which hand the key to the government instead of  apple. So you cant sue them when the  government get your data by mistake?  Are we clear now? What it actually says We admit we decrypted iPhones for law enforcement prior to iOS 8. Now you should trust us to not do this any more. And yes, everyone who cares - will trust. Nah not rly.. Why should I believe them? They have lied before. The only way of ensure trust is through transparency. > They have lied before."
"Do elaborate.Snowden revelations.All terrorists will now switch to the iPhone 6/6+.  Interesting way to gain some market share!  Apple wins.Clever. Get people to buy into iOS 8 because ppl will think their shit is encrypted/safe. Wait, this isn't /r/funny. Don't tell me people actually believe this crap.Well you sure provide compelling reasons not to with this statement.When it comes to matters of security, the burden of proof that your software is secure lies with the software creator, not the user. Apple uses proprietary software, therefore it is impossible to prove that their software is insecure. Therefore I wouldn't trust them when they spew a load of crap like this with 0 evidence to back it up.What a load of crap this statement is..."
"Essentially they have said that they only comply with Legal requests as much as required (as most companies are required to do), except where derr homeland security is concerned which falls under a different category and they can't tell you anything about..."
"So, most large companies already have this lip service.It sounds like they are specifically referring to no longer being able to unlock phones (that have a passcode) or bypass the passcode to access data.  However, the passcodes are only 4 digits...not exactly the strongest encryption key you can have.  Or am I reading this wrong?1. The 4 digit passcode is only allowed something like 10-15 attempts, after which it completely locks your device. This you can of course strengthen/decide yourself, but the default option is the one that matters most since that is what 99% of people use."
"2. The encryption key itself isn't the 4 digit passcode, it is a randomly generated string. This means authorities can't use a [chip-off](http://www.forensicswiki.org/wiki/Chip-Off_Forensics) facility to get direct access to the storage and just brute force the encryption key.You can have a complex keyboard passcode. You don't have to use 4 digits.And also Touch ID.Long password + Touch ID is the best . You only have to enter the long password after device restarts, which for me are very rare.After a few failed attempts it locks you out of your device. There is even an option to wipe it after 10. Brute forcing a password, or even 4-digit code becomes very impractical if you only have 10 tries [Speaking of brute force](http://xkcd.com/538/)Honeypot.BullshitWhat about all the maps data that apple has on its users?All the data they collect is anonymous. They don't know who they are getting it from.You cannot [find your parked car](http://9to5mac.com/2014/06/09/hidden-ios-8-assets-confirm-apple-working-on-maps-feature-to-find-your-parked-car/) with anonymous data. Apple stores your GPS coordinates, indexed by your unique ID in apple's cloud. That isn't anonymous by definition (anonymous means being unable to correlate data to a user). Ohh last i read it was anonymous. Oh well. Cool thanks for the new info! That's because LE already has the ability to decrypt on their own, so Apple no longer needs to do it for them. PR win for Apple but no substantive change.[deleted]600 millions users x (0.00385% / 100) = 23,100 users data breached?>data breached"
"I think you mean data disclosed. Breached is a word that would be referred to non-law enforcement entities like hackers or phishers.Distinction without a difference.No. I pretty much made it clear what the difference was. "
"The distinction is that breached means something is broken or has failed."
"Data being disclosed means there is no technology failure, just a human one. Depends on whether you wanted your data disclosed or not. The name of the receiving party is irrelevant.Why should we believe them?Or so they say...wait wait, they could do it to begin with?In the same way that Dropbox could turn over your files and so forth. Technically possible (if subpoenaed, for example) rather than we do it when bored at lunch.So now all they have to do is hack into their iCloud account to get nudes?"
"yes yes I know thost account were breached by guessing security questions etc. Oh sure apple Can they at least encrypt icloud so nobody can steal any more pics from celebrities?That's not how the pictures where stolen.I dont need facts, only headlines will do.I'm sorry, but law enforcement will still have access to your phone records. [Sounds legit](http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/dont_believe_you_anchorman.gif)Yeah right. Do you guys believe them?Not a chance in hell i believe this rhetoricApple, calling you out on your bullshit right now. Yeah, you really told them with that insightful comment!Go me! Woot!I love how this sub reddit acts, you'll pick up on such details that i would personally miss in other cases, but when it comes to Apple? You believe their every word... There's some fine wording there as others have pointed out. This is one huge marketing bullshit lie.sureeeeee, sounds like some marketing gimmick >Implying that this isn't a tag line to get you to install ios 8Bulllllshit.You're god damn right.Hmmm...BUY OUR NEW IPHONEI'm not giving a corporation more kudos than it deserves but Apple do seem to care about the security of their customer's data."
"I'm specifically pleased that they don't harvest my data to sell to an advertiser so I can then be targeted. They can take that position because they're not dependent on that revenue for their profit. They make their profit selling their hardware. I'm all for that."
"I like to know I'm buying a good-quality product that the maker also works hard at to protect from outside influences. To me that is very important added value. "
"Eddy Cue said that Apple are not interested in what I buy, who I buy it from and what I pay for it. Apple provides the feature, keeps my data safe and doesn't look over my shoulder to take notes. Apple is the polar opposite of the telcos that can't be content to just be the pipe, they also want to dictate what you can and cannot do with it."
"I'm not saying I agree with everything Apple does, but when they try their best to make a great product, don't throw me under the bus with regards to my data and they communicate clearly and openly about that, I don't know how you could hold that against them."
"I feel a lot more at ease with the idea of buying an iPhone 6 now. Bull. Shit."
"I full expect to see articles in a few weeks/months detailing backdoors, unauthorized trackers, and oops exploits built into the OS, much like every edition before it.Do elaborate on the backdoors there has been in every edtition, that don't require physical, unlocked access to the device.Haha, fat chance. Too little too late. The trust has been broken. Any company/government can say whatever they want and no one should take their word for it.  The only solution now is decentralization and open source. Still waiting on a secure, privacy-oriented, open-source mobile OS unfortunately. Hopefully one day. Android is open source, but it is also a privacy nightmare in many respects. Just look at their issues with permissions.'Hey. Good news, guys! We no longer have that back door built into the operating system.  You know, the one we never mentioned.  Really. I promise. You can trust Apple with all of your sensitive data.  What's that? Oh, right the photos. Well, with the amount of data we store we're a huge target. Once we have your credit card information stored,  no one will be interested in hacking us anymore. I mean, we're not nearly as big a *target* as some companies are.'"

"Edit Spelling: 'now' instead of 'no'They say it's encrypted with your passcode... that means that as long as you're using the standard 4-digit passcode it shouldn't be too hard to just try all 10k possibilities. If you have the device-wipe stuff on, then the next question is can the passcode be cracked offline, which is quite likely yes..."
"This has been an issue with android encryption for a while, it uses your unlock passcode to encrypt the disk, which means that it's generally fairly easy to brute-force.SureFive years from now: Oh wait, we lied, all your personal data has been snooped on forever, sucks to be you.It happeneds on every thread but..."

Still leaves iCloud for them to hand over...Load of bollocks. If they're asked they have to do it no it or but Are they done backstabbing us for every penny by making us buy new chargers for every phone we get?   Ridiculous.  I have friends now who come over and can't charge their older Iphones.  Money grubbing bastards is what Apple is all about.> We protect your privacy and data. Oh wait there is this little bug here that allows someone to brute force iCloud and the script is posted on github..."
"2 weeks later:"
"> Now we *really* protect your privacy and data and give you this free U2 album."
"Facepalm.They won't willingly hand over your information to law enforcement, but they also won't code it well enough to keep it safe from an angry/horny hacker. I can certainly sleep better at night now.That was about phishing and bad passwords."
"This is different. If you want to learn more about their actual encryption you can [read this](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4865?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US), but you will probably just ignore it and repost the same closely held convictions in another post.No, actually I'm super down to give this a look, thank you.Does this mean if we don't update we're fair game?They can't?"
"Hopefully they won't give unlimited attempts to others who want to try.If apple gave up the guys gps information we could have prevented those additional 30 murders. Also, I love how they say unlike our competitors directly attacking all other brands, which is funny because of all the faults in their security recently. If you try to access my phone more than 10 times it resets everything. Only 2 people know the passwords.[deleted]Yeah, no doubt.> If apple gave up the guys gps information we could have prevented those additional 30 murders"
"They can already get that from operators through cell tower information. AT&T doesn't even require a warrant https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-2014So devices are encrypted using the 4 digit pin code meaning Apple can't decrypt any data upon request? Uh... 4 digit pin code...I use a 10 letter password, personally.You can set an alpha numeric code from settings in place of the 4 digit pin, plus we know that the encryption is salted with the devices unique ID, so you would need to physically have access to the device in order to decryptThat's the point, you *would* have access to the device. The whole post is about Apple not being able to assist in helping access devices in possession of certain agencies."
"Yeah you can set alpha numeric codes, but my point was merely stating that for the majority of users, they use a 4 digit PIN, which when you have access to the device and a minimal understanding of the iOS Security model (which intelligence agencies do), it can be subverted.Well, anyone at risk of getting their phone taken from them for some reason should know about this risk and protect themselves anywayYou can set up the iPhone to reset everything after 10 failed attempts. Even when that isn't configured it'll add a delay after a certain number of failed attempts to prevent brute-forcing."
"Since iOS 7 you can no longer access the device storage over USB without trusting the computer which can only be done when the phone is unlocked."
"So the only way to brute-force it would be to unsolder the flash chip and dump the contents, and then use a copy of the encryption code to brute force the dumped data. Well within the reach of the say, the NSA looking for Snowden. Too expensive for local law enforcement. And easy for Apple to claim we don't have the equipment for thatw/I have tried this many times but I found some interesting story from http://freaksense.com/2014/09/apple-ios-8-released-review-downloads/| less than 0.00385% of customers had data disclosed due to government information requests."

If an ISIS member with a phone in the US is hatching a plot Apple won't let the police into it. Of Course they will, the down side of the publicity would be so large they would loose a lot of profit.  OK so you are not a virgin any more at it, now how about something less headline grabbing. Sure they will, but what will the police do to extract data from the secure enclave/element? We're talking about hardware lockdown here.Wow.. That apple has the balls to put up a page like that is blowing my mind"
"Go apple!Too little, far far too late.Too late for what? In what way too little?Hell yeah! Let the crimes commence!Didn't a tech-savvy user find iOS 6 sending your entire contacts list to Apple surreptitiously? "
"That didn't help Apple, imagine what there WATCH is collecting and sending (to who knows who).....because there have not been any recent data leaks involving Apple... They don't need to decrypt anything the NSA already records most of the information contained within the device. Yeah right...BUUUULLLLLSHHIITTTEEESick cuntsTIL: Apple does exactly what every other company does with LE search warrants.  Great PR stunt!Since the cats out this is what you say now Apple.I don't believe them.Have you all already forgotten the Snowden leaks? The things you all circlejerked about for so long?"
"Apple has a backdoor in their fucking OS. They aren't the good guys. They can't decrypt for law enforcement because they don't need to. The data is already in an NSA server the moment your iPhone/iPad/OSX creates that data (if it's connected to wifi/3G, and even when its not I'm sure there is some sort of limbo for the data to wait in until it's able to be sent back to HQ.)...but your pictures..? Yeah, they're fucked."
"#fappeningIn iCloud, yes, they're fucked."
"In your phone, no."
"Be careful where you store things.Exactly. I've never trusted cloud-based backups, and never will. My data is MY data and I will always store it locally on external HD's or whatever. I don't like the idea of my data being out there on some nebulous server.Are you fucking kidding me, the multi-billion dollar company that MAKES the device can't bypass a 4-digit pin code? Even if you use the long password method, there are jail break tweak that can do that and a huge company can't?Bullshithttp://replygif.net/i/242.gifIf you believe this, you're a gullible fool.Ok, so <technology company> says they are protecting our privacy. Leaked information later reveals that they were lying. <Technology company> then says, we're not doing that anymore."
"How do we know for a fact this is true? I mean, if they can put an album on your phone without your permission, how do you know they can't read whatever they want on it, whenever they want, or give that permission to whomever they want."
"Sorry, but until they give me control over the device and its security, I refuse to trust these kinds of statements anymore.Oh well, it's not like the NSA doesn't have a backdoor anyway. And it's not like they can easily look up any non encrypted information ever sent from your device. Oh wait, they can...While I absolutely commend Apple for this move, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Apple still maintains encryption keys to iCloud backups, which they can be compelled to provide given a warrant.  So all that's really protected here is any information NOT in iCloud backups. That's way less than what this circlejerk is excited about. In fairness, android encryption has been undecryptable by google from it's very inception. Apple can no longer decrypt the phone For law enforcement."
"thats not the issue"
"The issue is that the government has a MASSIVE surveillance network tha all that information about anyone around the globe with listening posts everywhere."
"your personal information being encrypted on there servers means nothing if the network itself is comprimised."
"And it matters little because again im relying and trust apple to protect the product."
"The only way to know if a device is secure is if it can be opened up and its code and hardware examined."
"apple and all closed source vendors are essentially asking you to have faith that there is not a backdoor. "
"remember all of apples statements might not be true if they government is compelling them otherwise,"
"I cant trust apple or any vendor that wont let the user actully look at the code they write for there product im trusting my information to hold."
"Plot twist: we won't have to. iOS 8 streams all your data through our servers before being encrypted.The Police can Just look into your phone they don't need permission from apple. Heres what they use to do it. Scary stuff.. http://www.cellebrite.com/Bullshit.Law enforcement has tools now, they don't need apple to decrypt. calling bullshit"
